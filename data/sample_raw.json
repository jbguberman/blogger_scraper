You shouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are. It\u2019s no wonder that nearly half of us never make video calls on mobile*. <br />\n<br />\nToday, we\u2019re releasing <a href=\"http://duo.google.com/\">Google Duo</a> \u2014 a simple 1-to-1 video calling app available for Android and iOS.

To get started, all you need is your phone number and you\u2019ll be able to reach people in your phone\u2019s contacts list. No separate account is required, so you can sign up in just a few steps. From there, you can instantly begin a video call with a single tap.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Fast and reliable</b><br />\nWe all know how it feels when a call fails to connect or when video gets choppy. We\u2019ve built Duo to be fast and reliable, so that video calls connect quickly and work well even on slower networks. Call quality adjusts to changing network conditions to keep you connected \u2014 when bandwidth is limited, Duo will gracefully reduce the resolution to keep the call going smoothly. For video calls on the go, Duo will switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call. You can start your call at home, and continue seamlessly even when you head out the door.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Human design</b><br />\nWe designed Duo to feel warm and inviting, focused on just you and the person you\u2019re calling. To make calls feel more like an invitation rather than an interruption, we created a feature in Duo called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIeMysX76pM\">Knock Knock</a> which lets you see live video of your caller before you answer, giving you a sense of what they\u2019re up to and why they want to chat.

In fact, one in five Rio residents live in favelas, but only 0.001 percent of the city's favelas appear on the map. That means 1.4 million people have no addresses to list on job applications or bank accounts, and aren\u2019t able to access many economic opportunities, essential services, even basic rights as citizens. So we teamed up with local NGO Grupo Cultural AfroReggae to map the favelas. Two years later, streets and 10,000+ local businesses in 26 favelas now appear on Google Maps, thanks to \"<a href=\"http://www.tanomapa.org/\">T\u00e1 no Mapa</a>,\" our \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1bGwRcyVNk\">On the Map</a>\" project.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T8utMLx44YU/V5rBIA9MlPI/AAAAAAAASug/FqghdddApCMBgmb4lvZf9FbH38bHkwqegCLcB/s1600/MapaRocinha_03_primeiroF.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T8utMLx44YU/V5rBIA9MlPI/AAAAAAAASug/FqghdddApCMBgmb4lvZf9FbH38bHkwqegCLcB/s640/MapaRocinha_03_primeiroF.gif\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\n<i>The Rocinha favela before and after our mapping project</i><br />\n<b><br />\nBeyond the Map</b><br />\nAlong the way, we met some amazing people with remarkable stories, so we decided it was time to go \"<a href=\"http://g.co/beyondthemap\">Beyond the Map</a>\" and shine a spotlight on an often overlooked side of Rio. With AfroReggae's help, we brought Street View and 360\u00b0 technology to favelas for the first time, creating an immersive experience that lets you go beyond GPS coordinates and get to know the people and culture of communities that many people otherwise wouldn't get the chance to visit.

Everyone in my family loves the <i>Star Wars</i> movies and we all want to be able to watch them, on our phones, tablets, laptops, or TV.  All purchases added to Family Library are available across Android devices, and movies, TV shows, and books can be enjoyed on iOS devices and the web.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Easily manage sharing and family purchases</b><br />\nAs with most family matters, flexibility and choice is important. With Family Library, you can choose which items you want to share and which to keep to yourself\u2014for example, I\u2019ll probably keep my collection of comic books in my personal library. Flexibility is also built into your purchasing options. When you sign up, you\u2019ll select a credit card to share as your family payment method, but your family members will always have the option of buying stuff with their personal credit cards or gift cards. And for your younger family members, you\u2019ll have the option to approve each of their purchases.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Share a Music subscription with your family</b><br />\nFinally, if your family loves music, you can also subscribe to the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/listen?signup=1&coupon=FAMILYSTANDARD&coupontype=VANITY\">Google Play Music family plan</a>. On this plan, up to six family members can stream millions of songs on demand for $14.99 a month.

So we wondered: Could technology help bring together two artists who might not otherwise meet? What would they create\u2026if their canvas were a spreadsheet? And how could we celebrate and share their work of art with the world?<br />\n<br />\nIn partnership with <a href=\"http://refinery29.com/\">Refinery29</a>, a lifestyle digital media company, we linked up with renowned illustrators <a href=\"http://marinaesmeraldo.com/\">Marina Esmeraldo</a> in Barcelona, and <a href=\"https://mallory-heyer.squarespace.com/\">Mallory Heyer</a> in NYC. We gave them a simple creative assignment\u2014to \u201cbreak the grid\u201d\u2014which literally can mean pushing the \u201cgrid\u201d of <a href=\"http://google.com/sheets/about\">Google Sheets</a> to its limits, but also taps into the idea of supporting and celebrating women globally who break free of confined roles and ways of thinking, which is core to Refinery29's mission.<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eTjjhLi0Xtk\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\n<br />\nMarina and Mallory connected a handful of times on Google Hangouts to plan and sketch out ideas, and creatively \u201chack\u201d Sheets in order to make art: resizing cells into thousands of pixel-like squares, merging cells to create color blocks, creating vibrant color gradients with <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/78413?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\">conditional formatting</a> and cell values, and other cool things we had no idea you could do with Sheets.<br />\n<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SqtrsRgUKRcAL1UX4X78VYe02moZck-SXTzhYzXbg_M/edit?usp=sharing\">result</a> was a bright, beautiful design that celebrates the diversity and strength of women, and we wanted to share their finished project in a BIG way.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ilBEKj-tNAs/V46Ia5PH5UI/AAAAAAAAcIc/2CBGHviRwEglJ1eA8CIB2sYjrwQ2mfsxwCEw/s1600/final_art%2B%25281%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"262\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ilBEKj-tNAs/V46Ia5PH5UI/AAAAAAAAcIc/2CBGHviRwEglJ1eA8CIB2sYjrwQ2mfsxwCEw/s640/final_art%2B%25281%2529.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\nThe final step was to convert Marina and Mallory\u2019s final piece from the cells of a spreadsheet to the bricks of a giant wall\u2014to go from Sheets to the streets.

We\u2019re continuing to build a culture where Googlers can grow, thrive and want to stay. We want to build a place where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas and opinions\u2014and empowered to grow their careers.<br />\n<br />\nWe check and recheck processes like promotion and performance reviews to make sure they\u2019re producing equitable outcomes, and address any gaps we find. For example, Googlers in engineering or product management roles are able to nominate themselves for promotion, and in 2010 we discovered that women in technical roles were less likely than men to self-nominate. We found that with a <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/google-test-case-gender-bias/\">small nudge</a>\u2014emailing these findings to all technical Googlers\u2014the rate of women self-nominating went up and now the gap between men and women has closed.<br />\n<br />\nCompensation is another example. We\u2019ve long had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2016/04/29/how-the-whats-your-current-salary-question-hurts-the-gender-pay-gap/\">gender pay equity in our workforce</a>, and we recently shared <a href=\"https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/pay-equity/steps/introduction/\">our approach to compensation</a> with the hope that other companies will adopt similar fair pay practices. <br />\n<br />\nWe also continue <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/05/12/google-unconscious-bias-diversity/27055485/\">to invest in our unconscious bias trainings</a>. Over 65 percent of Googlers have participated in our unbiasing workshops, and all new Googlers take the workshop as part of their orientation. We\u2019ve shared these materials and research on our platform <a href=\"https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/unbiasing/\">re:Work with Google</a> so anyone from any industry can create unbiasing trainings for their team. <br />\n<br />\nWe saw encouraging signs of progress in 2015, but we\u2019re still far from where we need to be.

Many of these questions don\u2019t have simple answers, and <a href=\"http://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/letters-from-the-mayors/\">decades of efforts</a> have not significantly moved the needle. There are more than 6,600 homeless people in the city, many of whom are children. People who experience homelessness often struggle from chronic stress, trauma, and frequent moves, and are unable to take advantage of many educational or economic opportunities.<br />\n<br />\nWe want to do our part in tackling this complex issue. Since 2014, Google.org has invested more than $5 million in Bay Area nonprofits who are working to combat homelessness, and today we\u2019re committing an additional $1.2 million for these efforts.

In 2015, we supported the <a href=\"https://hamiltonfamilycenter.org/\">Hamilton Family Center</a> (HFC) with a $1 million grant aimed to reduce the homeless family wait list for shelter by creating direct lines of communication with SFUSD teachers and staff to report and respond to new and potential cases of homelessness.  HFC has already seen a 25 percent reduction in the family wait list, and hopes to continue that momentum. <br />\nHomelessness in our cities is a challenge decades in the making\u2014and will require continued innovation and dedication to solve.

And within that mission lies the belief that the more knowledge we have, the more tolerant, inclusive and respectful the world ultimately will be. <br />\n<br />\nPride is a time when those who have access to vibrant LGBTQ communities take to the streets to celebrate the freedom to live and love.

To the 1,500 attendees joining from around the world, we warmly welcome you to Silicon Valley and hope to meet you! If you\u2019re attending the Summit, please stop by the Google for Entrepreneurs lounge, where you can sign up for 1:1 mentorship from dozens of Googlers and industry experts, explore product demos, and more. We\u2019re also hosting an interactive portal experience to connect attendees from the event to entrepreneurs around the world at Campus London, Campus Seoul, <a href=\"http://centraal.com/\">Centraal</a> in Mexico, and in Iraq and Afghanistan. And for those that can\u2019t join us in person, you can catch the action via <a href=\"http://youtube.com/Ges2016\">live stream</a>. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Mary Grove, Director, Google for Entrepreneurs</span>  <span data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"display: none; font-size: 0; line-height: 0; max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"> <span class=\"post-image\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4pQlNagjK1o/V3RKul6FmWI/AAAAAAAASnU/9wIfA5T7m_Mkp2K3vsPiX6U8aF0hWoIfACLcB/s1600/GES.jpg</span> </span><!--", "id": "8370045179203312967", "updated": "2016-06-29T15:37:39-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["entrepreneurship"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/8370045179203312967/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2016-06-23T09:00:00-07:00", "title": " Celebrating and advancing entrepreneurship around the world"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/06/im-feeling-yucky-searching-for-symptoms.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDY2NDM4NDE2OTk0Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/8724854581499994099", "content": "Picture this: you woke up today with a headache. It\u2019s been getting worse all day, and you aren\u2019t sure if you should be worried or not. So you open <a href=\"http://g.co/googleapp\">the Google app</a> and start searching for your symptoms. After 20 minutes digging through health forums, chances are you're overwhelmed by all the complicated medical terms and breaking out in a sweat\u2014whether that\u2019s related to the headache or the overdose of info is unclear!<br />\n<br />\nYou\u2019re not alone. Roughly 1 percent of searches on Google (think: <i>millions!</i>) are symptom-related. But health content on the web can be difficult to navigate, and tends to lead people from mild symptoms to scary and unlikely conditions, which can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress.<br />\n<br />\nSo starting in the coming days, when you ask Google about symptoms like \u201c<a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&amp;q=headache+on+one+side\">headache on one side</a>,\u201d we\u2019ll show you a list of related conditions (\u201cheadache,\u201d \u201cmigraine,\u201d \u201ctension headache,\u201d \u201ccluster headache,\u201d \u201csinusitis,\u201d and \u201ccommon cold\u201d). For individual symptoms like \u201c<a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&amp;q=headache\">headache</a>,\u201d we\u2019ll also give you an overview description along with information on self-treatment options and what might warrant a doctor\u2019s visit. By doing this, our goal is to help you to navigate and explore health conditions related to your symptoms, and quickly get to the point where you can do more in-depth research on the web or talk to a health professional. <br />\n<br />\nWe create the list of symptoms by looking for health conditions mentioned in web results, and then checking them against high-quality medical information we\u2019ve collected from doctors for our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html\">Knowledge Graph</a>. We worked with a team of medical doctors to carefully review the individual symptom information, and experts at Harvard Medical School and Mayo Clinic evaluated related conditions for a representative sample of searches to help improve the lists we show.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U5XJ9tHtkac/V2XImfC9WFI/AAAAAAAASkU/S-wT_db8KRIGEN-eVIeBEoz5PbZ-PXTSACLcB/s1600/Symptoms%2BSearch.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U5XJ9tHtkac/V2XImfC9WFI/AAAAAAAASkU/S-wT_db8KRIGEN-eVIeBEoz5PbZ-PXTSACLcB/s640/Symptoms%2BSearch.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />\nThat said, symptom search (like all medical information on Google) is intended for informational purposes only, and you should always consult a doctor for medical advice. We rely on search results, and we reflect what\u2019s on the web. Because of this, your feedback is especially important to us; we\u2019ll use it to keep improving the results we show. You\u2019ll notice in the weeks following launch that when we show symptom search we\u2019ll automatically ask you if the results are helpful. <br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re rolling this update out on mobile over the next few days, in English in the U.S. to start. Over time, we hope to cover more symptoms, and we also want to extend this to other languages and internationally. So the next time you\u2019re worried about your \u201c<a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&amp;q=child+with+knee+pain\">child with knee pain</a>\u201d (even though it\u2019s probably just growing pains), or have some symptoms you\u2019re too embarrassed to run by your roommate, a Google search will be a helpful place to start.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Veronica Pinchin, Product Manager</span>  <span data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"display: none; font-size: 0; line-height: 0; max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"> <span class=\"post-image\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xmPv09K0V3Y/V2XKa-8W73I/AAAAAAAASkg/-80cw-ml6Uglf5XzIDzzdPBAilWILTRzwCLcB/s1600/Symptoms.jpg</span> <!--\n\n\n\n  INSTRUCTIONS\n  Enter info below to be used in google.com/about site blog syndication.

He fled the country with his family through Turkey and into Greece, where they now live in a refugee camp near the Macedonian border.<br />\n<br />\nThough the Internet played a role in his flight from Syria, connectivity has played a crucial role in helping him rebuild his life in Greece. While living in Greek refugee camps, Walaa used YouTube to learn English, and his language skills are now so good that he\u2019s served as a community advocate and translator. He says he\u2019s far from done: next, he hopes to learn Greek.<br />\n<br />\nAs refugees across Europe adapt to new contexts, access to information and education are crucial to help them develop the skills they need. Last fall we encouraged you to donate to a public matching campaign to help refugees access not only basic humanitarian aid, but also resources to create a bridge to their new communities. Since then we\u2019ve helped the <a href=\"http://www.rescue.org/\">International Rescue Committee</a> build an <a href=\"https://refugeeinfo.eu/?language=en\">online information hub</a> for refugees, <a href=\"https://www.mercycorps.org.uk/\">Mercy Corps</a> develop <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mercycorps.translationcards&amp;hl=en_GB\">Translation Cards</a> to allow field workers to communicate across languages more easily, partner with <a href=\"http://nethope.org/\">NetHope</a> to install low-cost WiFi in refugee camps, and support refugee education through <a href=\"https://kiron.ngo/\">Kiron</a>, a nonprofit providing refugee-tailored university courses available both online and offline. <br />\n<br />\nIn addition to Walaa, we\u2019ve heard from other refugees who are finding ways to adjust thanks to Internet and education access. For example, Ahmed is an Iraqi computer scientist now living in Berlin. While waiting for his residence permit, he began teaching coding classes at refugee welcome centers as part of <a href=\"http://reconnect.nethope.org/\">Project Reconnect</a>, an initiative we launched with NetHope to equip NGOs with Chromebooks.

Today, in celebration of Father\u2019s Day, you can watch Love Letters for incarcerated fathers. This work is part of our continued commitment to <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/02/strengthening-our-commitment-to-racial.html\">raising awareness about racial injustice</a>, and to <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/02/26/bryan-stevenson-technology-industry-silicon-valley-diversity-google/80986922/\">bearing witness</a> to the human costs of mass incarceration. <br />\n<br />\nThe costs of mass incarceration have disproportionately affected the lives of Black men. From 1980 to 2007, about <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/03/02/us-drug-arrests-skewed-race\">one in three</a> of the 25.4 million adults arrested for drugs was African-American. And if that current trend continues, one in three Black boys born today can expect to spend time in prison during his lifetime. All in all, we\u2019re now at a point where there are <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/antonio-moore/black-mass-incarceration-statistics_b_6682564.html\">more African-American men incarcerated</a> in the U.S. than the total prison populations of India, Argentina, Canada, Lebanon, Germany, Finland, Israel and England combined.<br />\n<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/51Aw_eKKAzw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />\n<i>Children share digital \u201cLove Letters\u201d for their fathers who are incarcerated</i><br />\n<br />\nMany of these men are also fathers\u2014and their children have suffered greatly. The loss of a father to incarceration <a href=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/02/25/parents-incarceration-takes-toll-on-children-studies.html\">adversely</a> affects children\u2019s educational, social and emotional well-being, even decades later. <a href=\"http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2014/incarcerated-parents-and-childrens-health.aspx\">Children with an incarcerated parent</a> are three times more likely to have behavioral problems or depression, and at least twice as likely to suffer from learning disabilities, ADD/ADHD, and anxiety. <br />\n<br />\nThis is what Love Letters conveys: the hurt of the children left behind\u2014and the enduring bond between a child and a parent despite the barrier of prison walls. So for Father's Day, we worked with the NGOs <a href=\"http://popstheclub.com/\">Pops the Club</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theplace4grace.org/\">Place4Grace</a> to encourage children and youth in California to share their love letters to their fathers behind bars. We're also working with the California Department of Corrections to share the video with fathers behind bars throughout the state.<br />\n<br />\nTo learn about criminal justice reform legislation now going through Congress, visit <a href=\"http://www.sentencingproject.org/\">sentencingproject.org</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vera.org/\">vera.org</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/\">brennancenter.org</a>.

Today we\u2019re taking the next step with the first Tango-enabled phone (Lenovo\u2019s <a href=\"http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/tango/index.html?ipromoID=LEN264337\">PHAB2 Pro</a>).

Some of the coolest apps that work with Tango are the ones that overlay digital objects on top of your surroundings. For example if you\u2019re shopping for a new bed, Tango lets you view your bedroom through your phone and visualize different options\u2014even walk around the virtual furniture like it\u2019s actually there.<br />\n<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmXVMIRwuJQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />\n<br />\nWith a Tango-enabled phone, you also have a toy box, a solar system, and a pet shop in your pocket.  You can play with a huge set of dominoes, explore the planets, defend yourself from invading aliens, or feed your virtual dog\u2014all through your phone. The best part is that you don\u2019t have to clean up afterwards. <br />\n<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxTLOXzhqzA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />\n<br />\nIn the future, we hope Tango can help you navigate a mall, museum or place you\u2019ve never been. Tango can overlay directions to your destination, then provide more info once you arrive. We've already started to work on this\u2014we previewed it in February with the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J45EpCuD3Pw\">National Art Museum of Catalunya</a>, and we plan to bring select locations online later this year.<br />\n<br />\nWhether you\u2019re shopping, playing, or just finding your way around, Tango helps you explore the world in a new way.

My Account puts privacy and security tools in one place, including long-standing features like Ads Settings and newer ones like the <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup?utm_source=ogb-blog&utm_medium=blog-pr&utm_campaign=anniversary\">Privacy</a> and <a href=\"https://security.google.com/settings/security/secureaccount?utm_source=ogb-blog&utm_medium=blog-pr&utm_campaign=anniversary\">Security</a> Checkups. Collectively, these tools make it easy for you to control your privacy and security from any device.<br />\n<br />\nIn the past year, more than one billion people around the world have used My Account. Now, on the first anniversary of its launch, we're excited to introduce three new features to easily access your controls and protect your data.<br />\n<br />\n<b>A helping hand when you lose your phone</b><br />\nWe entrust our phones with some of our most personal data: texts from loved ones, family photos, work emails, bank account information, and more. In the wrong hands, that data could cause trouble. Unfortunately, <a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/06/smartphone-thefts-on-the-decline/index.htm\">millions of phones</a> are stolen every year in the U.S. alone, and countless more are lost in taxis, cafes, and couch cushions around the world. But when your phone goes missing, it\u2019s not always easy to figure out where to start, who to call, or how to keep your information safe. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://myaccount.google.com/find-your-phone?utm_source=ogb-blog&utm_medium=blog-pr&utm_campaign=anniversary\">Find your phone</a> is a new feature that will help you if your phone is ever lost or stolen. In a few simple steps, you can not only locate your phone, but also lock and call it, secure your account, leave a callback number on the screen, and more. The feature can be used to find lost Android and iOS devices, and soon, you\u2019ll also be able to access it by searching Google for \u201cI lost my phone.\u201d<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3DLURs6CjkU/V05qzjDeFOI/AAAAAAAASao/dlzzPNUT1uU-6Ru2Tf2ErBZL5vJ4A-aPACLcB/s1600/findyourphone.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3DLURs6CjkU/V05qzjDeFOI/AAAAAAAASao/dlzzPNUT1uU-6Ru2Tf2ErBZL5vJ4A-aPACLcB/s640/findyourphone.png\" /></a></div><b>New ways to access My Account</b><br />\nPeople are increasingly using their voices to navigate apps and services\u2014for example, mobile voice searches on Google have tripled in the past two years. So, we\u2019re making it easier to get to My Account just by using your voice. In the latest Google app you can simply say, \u201cOk Google, show me my Google account,\u201d and we\u2019ll take you right there. This is available today in English, with other languages coming soon.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0HdF3qXkw2I/V05q95KAntI/AAAAAAAASas/OELQ64M9LW8vEumjHWAXEyEtm_yQpOgxgCLcB/s1600/voice-search.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0HdF3qXkw2I/V05q95KAntI/AAAAAAAASas/OELQ64M9LW8vEumjHWAXEyEtm_yQpOgxgCLcB/s640/voice-search.png\" /></a></div>We\u2019re also making it easier than ever to find My Account by searching Google.  Coming soon, you\u2019ll be able to simply search for your own name, and if you\u2019re signed in, you\u2019ll see a shortcut to My Account.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tWrdJRsCucw/V05rGetEdvI/AAAAAAAASaw/RjefUGZuH7wUJEvsPNnEHncZNKQPzZXBwCLcB/s1600/my-account.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tWrdJRsCucw/V05rGetEdvI/AAAAAAAASaw/RjefUGZuH7wUJEvsPNnEHncZNKQPzZXBwCLcB/s640/my-account.png\" /></a></div>When you entrust your data to Google, you should expect powerful security and privacy controls. These features are just the latest in our ongoing efforts to protect you and your personal information.

We\u2019ve delivered more than 1.6 billion animations, collages and movies, among other things. You\u2019ve collectively freed up <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+GooglePhotos/posts/iuY2uPQWD17\">13.7 petabytes</a> of storage on your devices\u2014it would take 424 years to swipe through that many photos! We\u2019ve also applied 2 trillion labels, and 24 billion of those have been for ... selfies. <br />\n<br />\nTo celebrate our first birthday, we\u2019ve gathered a few of the team's favorite tips and updates we\u2019ve made in the past year, so you can keep all that good stuff going... <br />\n<br />\n1. To fly through Google Photos on the web at photos.google.com, press Shift-? to see a list of keyboard shortcuts.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-85PAMBt3ATo/V0iXNXfXkgI/AAAAAAAASZI/pEsrqkmR_p82HQ-LkOZVGQpCdUd0f29twCLcB/s1600/Keyboard%2BShortcuts.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-85PAMBt3ATo/V0iXNXfXkgI/AAAAAAAASZI/pEsrqkmR_p82HQ-LkOZVGQpCdUd0f29twCLcB/s640/Keyboard%2BShortcuts.png\" /></a></div><br />\n2. Narrow down your search results by searching for more than one thing at a time. Search for two people: \u201cMom and Dad,\u201d or a person and a place: \u201cMom Yosemite,\u201d a place and a thing: \u201cYosemite bear,\u201d or a person and a thing: \u201cMom bear\u201d to find that photo of your mama bear with the real bear.  <br />\n<br />\n3. Running out of Google storage? On photos.google.com, under settings, you can choose to convert all of your uploaded content from \u201cOriginal quality\u201d to the free \u201cHigh quality\u201d size to recover lots of space.<br />\n<br />\n4. Enter your favorite emoji (\ud83d\ude0e \ud83c\udf42 \ud83d\udc97 \ud83c\udf82 ) into search to pull up your corresponding photos. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQtGFBbwKEk\">Not joking</a>.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kuhNXZY7Ito/V0iVzMSCn_I/AAAAAAAASYk/6f9bjZraO1kgtCEOnONWyT8wULFdbYXNgCLcB/s1600/Emoji.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kuhNXZY7Ito/V0iVzMSCn_I/AAAAAAAASYk/6f9bjZraO1kgtCEOnONWyT8wULFdbYXNgCLcB/s400/Emoji.png\" /></a></div><br />\n5. On photos.google.com, easily find the photos you recently uploaded by going to search, then choosing \"Show More\u201d and then \u201cRecently Added.\u201d <br />\n<br />\n6. Tap into your device folders from the top of the albums page on Android, and see which folders are being backed up. Double-check that all those screenshots are safe!<br />\n<br />\n7. Create a shared album for your family. Every time someone adds a new photo, everyone will get a notification so they can see your latest photo or video.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IkmexYxLRtc/V0iXtw51Y0I/AAAAAAAASZY/ROODR7FEbRMGQ_ggKEjNO4NyXBnFqw6mACLcB/s1600/Shared%2BAlbums%2Bfamily.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IkmexYxLRtc/V0iXtw51Y0I/AAAAAAAASZY/ROODR7FEbRMGQ_ggKEjNO4NyXBnFqw6mACLcB/s640/Shared%2BAlbums%2Bfamily.png\" /></a></div><br />\n8. Have you spied the easter egg in the photo editor on Android? Hint...It\u2019s out of this world.<br />\n<br />\n9. Occasionally photos can appear out of order in your gallery\u2014perhaps because the date was incorrectly set on your phone or camera when you took them. On photos.google.com, you can edit both the time and time zone of a photo or group of photos to put them in the right order in your library. Change one and they all get adjusted.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TRa9_3je6RM/V0iXYnlYVfI/AAAAAAAASZQ/AQXAzRc4rwIbuohN8FlFV26prO6EN06jQCLcB/s1600/Batch%2BEdit.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TRa9_3je6RM/V0iXYnlYVfI/AAAAAAAASZQ/AQXAzRc4rwIbuohN8FlFV26prO6EN06jQCLcB/s640/Batch%2BEdit.png\" /></a></div><br />\n10. At the top of the albums page on mobile, scroll the carousel to the right and tap on the videos tile to get a view of all the videos in your library (on photos.google.com, you\u2019ll see videos at the top of the album page).<br />\n<br />\nThanks for a wonderful first year\u2014keep it up; all those selfies aren\u2019t going to take themselves!<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Anil Sabharwal, Vice President, Google Photos</span>  <span data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"display: none; font-size: 0; line-height: 0; max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"> <span class=\"post-image\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-41Xtn-xx7P8/V0iSHXk66oI/AAAAAAAASYA/Kyj9hzBMXFoDhWon4SgDCO-0-EwEbtMRwCLcB/s400/GooglePhotos.jpg</span> <!--\n\n\n  INSTRUCTIONS\n  Enter info below to be used in google.com/about site blog syndication.

We introduced you to two of the super users in this program <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/passionate-google-users-helping-others.html\">yesterday</a>, and now we\u2019re shining a spotlight on a few more. If you\u2019re interested in becoming a Top Contributor, start participating in a <a href=\"https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!home;lang=en\">Google Product Forum</a> or on <a href=\"https://crowds.conversocial.com/signup/helponsocial\">social media</a>, and <a href=\"https://services.google.com/fb/forms/topcontributor/\">let us know you\u2019re interested</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zl98oK5Ziho/V0X9hUP01zI/AAAAAAAASW8/WdUw78ci18QZBYh-dGud5wREFlEdTqkQACLcB/s1600/TCbters_Leo.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zl98oK5Ziho/V0X9hUP01zI/AAAAAAAASW8/WdUw78ci18QZBYh-dGud5wREFlEdTqkQACLcB/s640/TCbters_Leo.jpg\" /></a><br />\n<b>Leonika Sari says:</b> I\u2019m a developer and founder of the startup <a href=\"http://reblood.com/\">Reblood</a>, which aims to awareness and promote blood donation in Indonesia. But in my downtime, I help people regain access to their Gmail accounts. Imagine not being able to access your Gmail or finding out your account was hijacked\u2014it\u2019s quite scary! I like helping people get back into their accounts so they can continue living their life.<br />\n<br />\nAnswering posts in the Google Product Help Forums has also taught me a lot about how to run my startup. It\u2019s shown me the importance of listening and replying to users. Google treats every piece of user feedback as a useful resource to improve the product\u2014which inspires me to pay more attention to feedback about my own product and quickly turn that into product improvements. I also see parallels between the community of volunteers in the Top Contributor program and my own company Reblood\u2019s community of donors. It makes me happy that I can help people, even those I\u2019ve never met.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uwBuKp8VZiE/V0X-uKmtx5I/AAAAAAAASXI/0FTbi4sv0b8emFYAAwamyMC9mqLLOInsACLcB/s1600/TCbters_JoseJorge.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uwBuKp8VZiE/V0X-uKmtx5I/AAAAAAAASXI/0FTbi4sv0b8emFYAAwamyMC9mqLLOInsACLcB/s640/TCbters_JoseJorge.jpg\" /></a><br />\n<b>Jos\u00e9 says:</b> \u200bI work in the Systems and Education Innovation Department for Colegio Alameda de Osuna in Madrid. My son, Jorge, is studying psychology at Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid. We\u2019re both passionate about helping and are members of the Top Contributor Program. I\u2019m a TC and Jorge is a Rising Star, the entry level into the Top Contributor program.<br />\n<br />\nI was the first one to discover Google Product Help Forums. Helping people in the forums is very similar to teaching. It allows me to do something I like\u2014teach\u2014while enabling me to reach a much larger number of people than I would in the classroom. Plus, I get to learn more about tools I use in my job on a daily basis.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Jorge says:</b> My dad told me about the forums last summer when I was off from school. I thought I\u2019d give it a try and now I\u2019m hooked. I like it because helping others makes me feel good. When I was first starting, my dad would help me by suggesting solutions or showing me other ways of answering a question. Now that I\u2019m back in school and busy with classes, the Top Contributor program helps us stay in touch. In fact, I think it improves our relationship.<br />\n<br />\nThe Top Contributor program has brought us many great connections.

Last year, Top Contributors helped more than 55 million people with 30 different Google products, answering questions and providing tips. <br />\n<br />\nThe super users in the Top Contributor program come from 60+ different countries. Their passion for our products and willingness to help others make them a community. To showcase the faces and stories behind this group of helpful users, we asked a few Top Contributors to share a bit about themselves. This is the first of two posts\u2014come back tomorrow to learn more.<br />\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SlndAwl3pRM/V0SoBhJhFII/AAAAAAAASV0/sFUrrNEZhgo8-Lqkmxo3aGXYRx8J5InzACLcB/s1600/TCbters_Jo.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SlndAwl3pRM/V0SoBhJhFII/AAAAAAAASV0/sFUrrNEZhgo8-Lqkmxo3aGXYRx8J5InzACLcB/s640/TCbters_Jo.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a><br />\n<b>Jo says:</b> As a writer, editor, and all-around book enthusiast, I spend a lot of time using word-processing programs. I first discovered Google Docs when I saw a Chromebook ad on TV. I was intrigued by the idea of working in the cloud and not needing an external hard drive to backup my work.<br />\n<br />\nI use Docs for both my professional and personal writing and have completed works of nonfiction as well as novels in it. As senior editorial director at <a href=\"https://www.bookpubco.com/\">Book Publishing Co.</a>, I use Docs for reviewing and editing manuscripts, writing copy, and communicating with authors and colleagues. My authors and colleagues are fascinated when we're in a document at the same time and they see me making changes. It looks like magic to them!<br />\n<br />\nHelping others navigate Docs might seem like an unusual hobby, but I love it. I like exercising my brain by exploring all that an app can do. It\u2019s rewarding to answer users\u2019 questions and help them solve conundrums, especially knowing that my reply could potentially reach hundreds or even thousands of others users who visit the forum with a similar issue. The occasional \u201cthank you\u201d or \u201cyou saved the day\u201d is icing on the cake.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LLa-ymd_OLU/V0Sof7rrY6I/AAAAAAAASV4/fSifZ30Re0IzeG8F4ASlphLJgi-X2xX0wCLcB/s1600/TCbters_Kojo.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LLa-ymd_OLU/V0Sof7rrY6I/AAAAAAAASV4/fSifZ30Re0IzeG8F4ASlphLJgi-X2xX0wCLcB/s640/TCbters_Kojo.jpg\" /></a><br />\n<b>Kojo says:</b> I grew up in a small town in the central region of Ghana, the oldest of five children\u2014which meant I learned how to work hard. Being the oldest meant I had to set a positive example for my siblings and cousins. I graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in chemistry with honors from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, where I\u2019m now a teaching and research assistant.<br />\n<br />\nI first got involved with Google products as a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/edu/resources/programs/student-ambassador-program/\">Google Student Ambassador</a>, a program that gives students the opportunity to be a liaison between their university and Google. During that time, I gave tutorials to anyone from first year students to senior faculty in my department, teaching them how to incorporate Google apps like Drive, Docs, Sheets and Slides into their day-to-day. <br />\n<br />\nWhen I became a teaching and research assistant, I started using Google Forms to create short quizzes and Google Groups to send assignments and notes to the students in my lab experiment groups. Those experiences inspired me to start helping out in the forums, where I specialize in Nexus and Photos\u2014products I don\u2019t often get to use in the classroom. <br />\n<br />\nI love troubleshooting issues with products because it challenges me to pinpoint issues given very little information. It not only teaches me to solve problems, but it also shows me how I can interrelate things when teaching in order to help students. My experience there inspires me to take on more challenges elsewhere. Next up: grad school.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Get involved with the Top Contributor Program</b> <br />\nWe\u2019re always looking for people around the world who have strong Google product knowledge, a friendly attitude, and enjoy helping others. If you\u2019re interested in becoming a Top Contributor, start participating in a <a href=\"https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!home;lang=en\">Google Product Forum</a> or on <a href=\"http://goo.gl/helponsocial\">social media</a>, and <a href=\"https://services.google.com/fb/forms/topcontributor/\">let us know you\u2019re interested</a>.

Here\u2019s a look at I/O beyond the keynote:<br />\n<br />\n<b>1. It\u2019s not just for grown-ups.</b><br />\nA day before Google I/O officially began, we hosted <a href=\"http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2016/05/inspiring-tomorrows-coders.html\">I/O Youth</a>. Over the course of the day, 120 students from Bay Area-based schools engaged in four hands-on activities focused on storytelling, designing, and coding. They heard from inspiring speakers that bring creative solutions to their jobs like Brent Bushnell, CEO of the entertainment company <a href=\"http://twobitcircus.com/\">Two Bit Circus</a>, and Pavni Diwanji, who leads our Google-wide efforts to create a better experience for kids online.

Machine learning is already making products smarter.</b><br />\nAs Sundar said during his keynote, machine learning and artificial intelligence are changing computing in incredible ways. One of the biggest uncracked nuts in A.I. is understanding natural language. But we\u2019re making progress, and we can see people are eager for it\u2014on the Google app on Android, over 20 percent of the searches we get in the U.S. are now by voice. Ok Google!<br />\n<br />\n<b>3. ATAP is bridging the physical and the digital. </b><br />\nOn Friday, ATAP took the stage to share a glimpse of what\u2019s going on in the ATAP garage. In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqCH4DNQBUA&amp;feature=youtu.be\">\u201cPearl,\u201d an interactive 360 story</a> made for mobile by Academy award-winning director Patrick Osborne, a girl and her dad crisscross the country in their beloved hatchback.

With the LG Electronics Inc. smartwatch and JBL by Harman speaker prototypes Project Soli demonstrated, you don\u2019t have to touch a screen to view a message or change a song. And Ara showed off a developer version of their modular phone and provided a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWW5mQadZAY\">peek</a> into a future where phones can be customized for function and style. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tUVmGCDPXHU/V0SbkwCF1aI/AAAAAAAASVc/oCZbN7D5fK85PnXFROfbolstmSoIaTp2ACLcB/s1600/atap.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tUVmGCDPXHU/V0SbkwCF1aI/AAAAAAAASVc/oCZbN7D5fK85PnXFROfbolstmSoIaTp2ACLcB/s640/atap.gif\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\n<i>The Soli smartwatch prototype (developed in collaboration with LG Electronics Inc.) is controlled without touching the screen</i><br />\n<i><br />\n</i> <b>4. We're working to make I/O more inclusive for everyone.</b><br />\nAs in past years, we made an effort to make I/O a diverse and welcoming conference for women and minorities who are underrepresented in technology. Women at I/O made up 23 percent of our 7,000+ attendees (at last year\u2019s conference, women made up a similar percentage of our 5,000 attendees). We partnered with 13 community groups for women in technology, and offered travel grants to attendees making the trip. On Tuesday night, we hosted a <a href=\"http://womentechmakers.com/\">Women Techmakers</a> dinner for 1,000 women.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a6xxyTQJAqs/V0SblNa6F_I/AAAAAAAASVg/g7nZZk-AssIUiUswNBRWtIo1E5-9TInywCLcB/s1600/womentechmakers.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a6xxyTQJAqs/V0SblNa6F_I/AAAAAAAASVg/g7nZZk-AssIUiUswNBRWtIo1E5-9TInywCLcB/s640/womentechmakers.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\n<i>Women Techmakers dinner</i><br />\n<br />\nWe also want I/O to be more accessible for people with disabilities. To that end, we worked with Googlers and attendees with disabilities to provide things like real-time captioning for all breakout sessions at the conference.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, this was also the <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/05/16/google-io-works-to-close-the-race-and-gender-gap/84457548/\">first year we released ethnicity and race information</a> for a Google conference.<br />\n<br />\n<b>5. We\u2019ve made custom hardware for machine learning.</b><br />\nWe designed and built a chip (of the silicon variety) that\u2019s specifically made for machine learning. We call it a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html\">Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)</a> because it's tailored for TensorFlow, our machine learning software that\u2019s openly available to all. A TPU is an order of magnitude (10x) more power efficient than a traditional computer chip\u2014and TPUs were also the secret hardware sauce for AlphaGo, our <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/03/what-we-learned-in-seoul-with-alphago.html\">machine learning system that played and won 4 of 5 matches</a> with Lee Sedol in Korea.<br />\n<br />\n<b>6. The Google Play Music experience blended Google smarts with musical discovery.</b><br />\nNot far from the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFmgvgJwr0E/?taken-by=google\">dancing paint robot</a>, I/O\u2019s Google Play Music room brought Google Search and Google Play Music together in perfect harmony. On the Play Connections Wall, you could explore connections between different artists, albums, and songs, powered by the Knowledge Graph. Nearby, a display with 3,000+ earphone jacks let you listen to songs from Google Play Music\u2019s many different playlists, complete with LED lights that matched the mood of each song. The audio cables powering the display added up to 18,000 feet (3.4 miles)\u2014almost as tall as Mount Kilimanjaro.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8tdjDNCbkac/V0SbkcUFHvI/AAAAAAAASVY/K0OdK87lgOARlfKTRi8pYiWZSdihyg3IwCLcB/s1600/playmusic.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8tdjDNCbkac/V0SbkcUFHvI/AAAAAAAASVY/K0OdK87lgOARlfKTRi8pYiWZSdihyg3IwCLcB/s640/playmusic.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\n<b>7. Android Pay is powering commutes in the U.K. and ATMs in the U.S.</b><br />\nLast week we announced the first countries outside of the U.S. to get Android Pay, <a href=\"http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2016/05/android-pay-now-in-uk-new-countries-on.html\">starting with the U.K.</a>&nbsp;Londoners will also be able to use Android Pay across the Transport for London network, including on the tube, bus, and rail. That\u2019s 13 million journeys where you can now just tap and pay. In the U.S., Bank of America customers will be able to start using their phones to withdraw money in ATMs across the country starting in June. <br />\n<br />\n<b>8. Your favorite Google apps are coming to Daydream.</b><br />\nAs part of our <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2016/05/vr-at-google-jump-expeditions-and.html\">effort to make VR even more accessible and immersive</a>, we\u2019re planning to bring some of your favorite Google apps to Daydream, including Play Movies, Street View, Google Photos, and YouTube. The <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2016/05/a-youtube-experience-like-nothing-youve.html\">YouTube VR app</a> will provide an easier, more immersive way to find and experience virtual reality content on YouTube.

It was full of festival fun.</b><br />\nBringing I/O to Shoreline Amphitheatre meant a conference with a festival feel. Interactive experiments let people from around the world send paper planes and splashes of virtual paint zooming onto the keynote stage. That night, Charli XCX and Kygo performed for a crowd lit up with glow sticks. And at After Hours, acrobats mingled alongside a karaoke rickshaw, DJs spun from the tops of art cars, and domes that held tech talks during the day were converted into underwater discos and a planetarium. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CycCXZe2NFw/V0Sbj0OzrRI/AAAAAAAASVQ/FfY4jGjnDZAsSDAL9z2wiVBjNvUHEY1GACLcB/s1600/afterhours.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"478\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CycCXZe2NFw/V0Sbj0OzrRI/AAAAAAAASVQ/FfY4jGjnDZAsSDAL9z2wiVBjNvUHEY1GACLcB/s640/afterhours.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\nFor more from #io16, check out <a href=\"https://goo.gl/3JJmFJ\">this photo album from the event</a> or take a tour of the sandbox in 360 degrees:<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E5lrU5v17Qo\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Emily Wood, Managing Editor, Google Blogs</span>  <span data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"display: none; font-size: 0; line-height: 0; max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"> <span class=\"post-image\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DMY1ngwflog/V0Xz0RRWipI/AAAAAAAASWU/CMfpXcIfbLwu-GkW2XOFI1s-XkRSXa-rgCLcB/s1600/Copy%2Bof%2BCopy%2Bof%2BDSC_0615.jpg</span> <!--\n  INSTRUCTIONS\n  Enter info below to be used in google.com/about site blog syndication.

Much has changed since our first developer event 10 years ago, and even more since Google started 17 years ago. Back then, there were 300 million people online, connecting through desktop machines; today that number is over 3 billion, with the majority using mobile devices as their primary way to get information, organize their day, get from point A to point B, and stay in touch. In a world in which the mobile phone has become the remote control for our daily lives, Google\u2019s mission \u201cto organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful\u201d is truer and more important than ever before. <br />\n<br />\n<b>The Google assistant</b><br />\nWhen we think of the Google search experience today\u2014a rich panel of information on [Zika virus], or an alert telling you your flight is delayed\u2014it\u2019s striking to see how far things have come from the early days of 10 blue links. Many of these advances have been thanks to machine learning and artificial intelligence\u2014specifically, areas like natural language processing, voice recognition and translation\u2014and they have helped us build an increasingly useful and assistive experience for users. They are the ingredients that make Google speech recognition the most accurate in the world, and that let you take a picture of a sign in Chinese and see it translated into English. <br />\n<br />\nProgress in all of these areas is accelerating, and we believe we are at a seminal moment. People are increasingly interacting naturally with Google, and aren\u2019t just looking for the world\u2019s information but actually expecting Google to help them with their daily tasks.  <br />\n<br />\nWhich is why we\u2019re pleased to introduce...the Google assistant.<br />\n<br />\nThe assistant is conversational\u2014an ongoing two-way dialogue between you and Google that understands your world and helps you get things done. It makes it easy to buy movie tickets while on the go, to find that perfect restaurant for your family to grab a quick bite before the movie starts, and then help you navigate to the theater. It\u2019s a Google for you, by you.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3UuL0Dlv9RQ/Vzx1HvHCTEI/AAAAAAAASUQ/uZfManQSGX8VWNn8Jw-P_8FDV3L0UU46QCLcB/s1600/OPA_Social_v04_JRS_2016-05-17.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3UuL0Dlv9RQ/Vzx1HvHCTEI/AAAAAAAASUQ/uZfManQSGX8VWNn8Jw-P_8FDV3L0UU46QCLcB/s640/OPA_Social_v04_JRS_2016-05-17.gif\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>The assistant is an ambient experience that will work seamlessly across devices and contexts. So you can summon Google\u2019s help no matter where you are or what the context. It builds on all our years of investment in deeply understanding users' questions.<br />\n<br />\nToday we gave a preview of two new products where you\u2019ll soon be able to draw on the Google assistant.  <br />\n<br />\n<b>Google Home</b><br />\nGoogle Home is a voice-activated product that brings the Google assistant to any room in your house. It lets you enjoy entertainment, manage everyday tasks, and get answers from Google\u2014all using conversational speech. With a simple voice command, you can ask Google Home to play a song, set a timer for the oven, check your flight, or turn on your lights. It\u2019s designed to fit your home with customizable bases in different colors and materials. Google Home will be released later this year. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nilr6F7t1AU/Vzx1LP1d1SI/AAAAAAAASUc/rkjvgsCCl3kH3k331gHAWxMC05MZWxNiwCLcB/s1600/GH_Livingroom.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"458\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nilr6F7t1AU/Vzx1LP1d1SI/AAAAAAAASUc/rkjvgsCCl3kH3k331gHAWxMC05MZWxNiwCLcB/s640/GH_Livingroom.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><b>Allo and Duo</b><br />\nAllo is a new messaging app that also comes complete with the Google assistant, so you can interact with it directly in your chats, either one-on-one or with friends. Because the assistant understands your world, you can ask for things like your agenda for the day or photos from your last trip. If you\u2019re planning a dinner with friends, you can ask the assistant to suggest restaurants nearby, all in one thread. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JuyJy-4ZY8k/Vzx1Jj76mpI/AAAAAAAASUY/cTmHT6Y3AbsGIoko9tO_wyJJ_OB7mYrOACLcB/s1600/fireball-assistant.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JuyJy-4ZY8k/Vzx1Jj76mpI/AAAAAAAASUY/cTmHT6Y3AbsGIoko9tO_wyJJ_OB7mYrOACLcB/s640/fireball-assistant.png\" width=\"358\" /></a></div>Allo includes Smart Reply, which suggests responses to messages based on context, and comes with fun ways to make your chats more expressive, including emojis, stickers, and the ability to get creative with photos. There\u2019s also an Incognito mode that provides end-to-end encryption, discreet notifications, and message expiration.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to Allo, we\u2019re introducing Duo, a companion app for one-to-one video calling. With Duo, our goal is to make video calling faster and more reliable, even on slower network speeds. We also introduced a feature called Knock Knock, which gives you a live video of the other caller before you answer. <br />\n<br />\nBest of all, both Allo and Duo are based on your phone number, so you can communicate with anyone regardless of whether they\u2019re on Android or iOS. Both apps will be available this summer.

Most of the time, this means picking up our phones and sending a message or starting a call. Today we\u2019re sharing a preview of two new apps that take a fresh look at how people connect. <br />\n<b><br />\n</b> <b>Allo, a smart messaging app</b><br />\nAllo is a smart messaging app that makes your conversations easier and more expressive. It\u2019s based on your phone number, so you can get in touch with anyone in your phonebook. And with deeply integrated machine learning, Allo has smart features to keep your conversations flowing and help you get things done.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vq9CkOc8UnE/Vzx3gVOFk8I/AAAAAAAASUw/nQgWUgsLBKoz2aDDEMWKUJ8KJKiM266PQCLcB/s1600/1-Expressiveness_animation_v4-GIF_abbrev.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vq9CkOc8UnE/Vzx3gVOFk8I/AAAAAAAASUw/nQgWUgsLBKoz2aDDEMWKUJ8KJKiM266PQCLcB/s640/1-Expressiveness_animation_v4-GIF_abbrev.gif\" width=\"314\" /></a></div><i>Emojis, stickers, Ink, and our Whisper Shout feature in Allo</i><br />\n<br />\nAllo has Smart Reply built in (similar to <a href=\"https://gmail.googleblog.com/2015/11/computer-respond-to-this-email.html\">Inbox</a>), so you can respond to messages without typing a single word. Smart Reply learns over time and will show suggestions that are in your style. For example, it will learn whether you\u2019re more of a \u201chaha\u201d vs. \u201clol\u201d kind of person. The more you use Allo the more \u201cyou\u201d the suggestions will become. Smart Reply also works with photos, providing intelligent suggestions related to the content of the photo. If your friend sends you a photo of tacos, for example, you may see Smart Reply suggestions like \u201cyummy\u201d or \u201cI love tacos.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yZ11M5aHNfQ/Vzx3gXewCgI/AAAAAAAASUs/j3cX6seCApg0rfi3VElf503zGeKbfk_zACLcB/s1600/2-Smart-Replies_animation_v6-GIF_abbrev.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yZ11M5aHNfQ/Vzx3gXewCgI/AAAAAAAASUs/j3cX6seCApg0rfi3VElf503zGeKbfk_zACLcB/s640/2-Smart-Replies_animation_v6-GIF_abbrev.gif\" width=\"313\" /></a></div><i>Smart Reply suggestions in Allo</i><br />\n<br />\nAllo also features the Google assistant, bringing the richness of Google directly into your chats\u2014helping you find information, get things done, and have fun. You can chat one-on-one with the assistant, or call on Google in a group chat with friends. Either way, you no longer have to jump between apps to do things like book a dinner reservation with friends, get up-to-date sports scores, settle a bet, or play a game. The assistant in Allo lets you bring things like Search, Maps, YouTube and Translate to all your conversations, so that you and your friends can use Google together. <br />\n<br />\nThe Google assistant in Allo understands your world, so you can ask for things like your agenda for the day, details of your flight and hotel, or photos from your last trip. And since it understands natural language patterns, you can just chat like yourself and it\u2019ll understand what you\u2019re saying. For example, \"Is my flight delayed?\" will return information about your flight status.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ROYrLax6ggg/Vzx3fKq_mjI/AAAAAAAASUo/M5hptuwxzqYuhcyB1jcYcbwSA0nHiiN0wCLcB/s1600/3-Gbot_animation_v4-GIF_abbrev%2B%25281%2529.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ROYrLax6ggg/Vzx3fKq_mjI/AAAAAAAASUo/M5hptuwxzqYuhcyB1jcYcbwSA0nHiiN0wCLcB/s640/3-Gbot_animation_v4-GIF_abbrev%2B%25281%2529.gif\" width=\"314\" /></a></div><i>Google assistant in Allo</i><br />\n<br />\nPrivacy and security are important in messaging, so following in the footsteps of Chrome, we created Incognito mode in Allo. Chats in Incognito mode will have end-to-end encryption and discreet notifications, and we\u2019ll continue to add new features to this mode. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Duo, a video calling app for everyone</b><br />\nDuo is a simple, fast one-to-one video calling app for everyone\u2014whether you\u2019re on Android or iOS, a fast or slow connection, in New York or New Delhi. Like Allo, Duo is based on your phone number, allowing you to reach anyone in your phonebook. And its simple interface fades away when you\u2019re in a call, so it\u2019s just the two of you.<br />\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iAtJJsbnTng/Vzx4hDSuXHI/AAAAAAAASU4/1_y7oZf4ntoJsqoRLOdWFCvKLZIX4MqUQCLcB/s1600/social-2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iAtJJsbnTng/Vzx4hDSuXHI/AAAAAAAASU4/1_y7oZf4ntoJsqoRLOdWFCvKLZIX4MqUQCLcB/s640/social-2.png\" width=\"640\" /></a><br />\n<div><i>Video call in Duo</i></div><br />\nOne of our favorite features of Duo is Knock Knock, which shows you a live video preview of the caller before you pick up. Knock Knock invites you into the moment, making calls feel spontaneous and fun. Once you answer, Duo seamlessly transitions you right into the call. <br />\n<br />\nDuo calls are in crisp HD video (up to 720p) and audio. We\u2019ve optimized Duo to work well even on spotty networks, so if bandwidth is limited it gracefully adjusts quality so you\u2019re still able to connect. We also seamlessly transition calls between cellular and Wi-Fi, so you don\u2019t need to worry about what network you\u2019re on. Finally, we built Duo with privacy and security in mind and all calls on Duo are end-to-end encrypted.<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CIeMysX76pM\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\nBoth apps will be available this summer on Android and iOS.

You can only fully appreciate the genius of artists like Monet or Van Gogh when you stand so close to a masterpiece that your nose almost touches it. As you step back from the brush strokes, you wonder how it all comes together. At the Google Cultural Institute, we know that people love experiencing art in close detail. Millions of people spend time exploring our ultra-high resolution \u201cgigapixel\u201d images, inch by inch\u2014spotting something new every time, like a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/the-gods-of-the-olympus/XwFDbQC5UuACCA?ms=%7B%22x%22%3A0.6067738638398309%2C%22y%22%3A0.644676407394092%2C%22z%22%3A12.079563859553183%2C%22size%22%3A%7B%22width%22%3A0.08003103489631716%2C%22height%22%3A0.22248817032094279%7D%7D\">hidden signature</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/the-port-of-rotterdam/XAFcyRe5y7Mo7Q?ms=%7B%22x%22%3A0.6440979063197267%2C%22y%22%3A0.7190202766766446%2C%22z%22%3A13.530874811694657%2C%22size%22%3A%7B%22width%22%3A0.028144807397305734%2C%22height%22%3A0.05763905975744561%7D%7D\">individual dabs of paint</a> that give the impression of shimmering, turbulent waters. <br />\n<br />\nZooming into these images is the closest thing to walking up to the real thing with a magnifying glass. This is why we\u2019re so excited about our new Art Camera\u2014a custom-built camera ready to travel around the world to bring people more of these ultra-high-resolution images than ever possible before. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HZXoLojEa6M/VzsTzdAJyYI/AAAAAAAASTc/adx81q44QhQUdfqGJvehonczOxo2k26pACLcB/s1600/port%2Bof%2Brotterdam.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"492\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HZXoLojEa6M/VzsTzdAJyYI/AAAAAAAASTc/adx81q44QhQUdfqGJvehonczOxo2k26pACLcB/s640/port%2Bof%2Brotterdam.gif\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><i><a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/the-port-of-rotterdam/XAFcyRe5y7Mo7Q?projectId=art-camera\">The Port of Rotterdam by Paul Signac, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen</a> </i><br />\n<br />\nA gigapixel image is made of over one billion pixels, and can bring out details invisible to the naked eye.  So creating digital images in such high resolution is a complex technical challenge. You need time, highly specialized and expensive equipment, and only a few people in the world can do the job. In the first five years of the Google Cultural Institute, we\u2019ve been able to share about 200 gigapixel images. But we want to do much more. That\u2019s why we developed the Art Camera. <br />\n<br />\nThe Art Camera is a robotic camera, custom-built to create gigapixel images faster and more easily. A robotic system steers the camera automatically from detail to detail, taking hundreds of high resolution close-ups of the painting. To make sure the focus is right on each brush stroke, it\u2019s equipped with a laser and a sonar that\u2014much like a bat\u2014uses high frequency sound to measure the distance of the artwork. Once each detail is captured, our software takes the thousands of close-up shots and, like a jigsaw, stitches the pieces together into one single image.<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dOrJesw5ET8\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\nMany of the works of our greatest artists are fragile and sensitive to light and humidity. With the Art Camera, museums can share these priceless works with the global public while ensuring they're preserved for future generations. We want to give museums the tools they need to do this important work, so we're sending a fleet of these cameras from museum to museum around the world\u2014for free. <br />\n<br />\nThe Art Camera will dramatically increase the scale and depth at which museums are able to provide access to our shared cultural heritage to anyone around the world. For example, if you wanted to see Van Gogh\u2019s six famous portraits of the Roulin family up close, you\u2019d need to travel across the Netherlands then over to LA and New York. Now the Art Camera can travel for you. It\u2019s already captured the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/portrait-of-armand-roulin/3wF7xOZU-dKdrg\">Portrait of Armand Roulin</a>, which you can explore alongside <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/browse/roulin\">the rest of the family</a>, all in one place. <br />\n<br />\nToday, we\u2019re sharing the first thousand ultra-high resolution images of artworks from artists including <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/apple-harvest/GgEtbnL6cNOmjg?projectId=art-camera\">Pissarro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/rotterdam-the-steams/DgEEOeCaNUMUdQ\">Signac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/titus-at-his-desk/KwEx0M8TF4uCTg?projectId=art-camera\">Rembrandt</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/vase-with-red-and-white-flowers/gQGHbLBk4GDk3g?projectId=art-camera\">Van Gogh</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/champ-de-coquelicots/HQHTJy6eBzNayQ?projectId=art-camera\">Monet</a> and many more from museums across Australia, India, the Netherlands, Brazil and everywhere in between. As we prepare to celebrate <a href=\"http://network.icom.museum/international-museum-day\">International Museum Day</a> and welcome more than 25 new museums on the Google Cultural Institute, we want to thank everyone who worked with us to test the new camera in the recent months.

And <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-sheet\">Blacks are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of whites</a>\u2014in fact, the United States imprisons a larger percentage of its Black population than <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/10/mapping-the-new-jim-crow/381617/\">South Africa did at the height of apartheid</a>. <br />\n<br />\nAn often overlooked fact of mass incarceration is that many first-time, nonviolent offenders who receive prison sentences are parents. There are 2.7 million American children with a parent behind bars, and Black children are 7.5 times more likely to have a parent behind bars than their white counterparts. The experience of having a parent in prison is traumatizing to a child: a new <a href=\"http://www.aecf.org/blog/report-recommends-policies-to-help-millions-of-children-with-incarcerated-parents/\">study from the Annie E. Casey Foundation</a> found that the incarceration of a parent can have as much impact on a child\u2019s well-being as abuse or domestic violence. <br />\n<br />\nSo this Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day, in an effort to raise awareness of the impact of mass incarceration, we\u2019ve partnered with NGOs on Love Letters: a series of videos that contain children\u2019s messages of love for a mother or father in prison. These digital love letters are demonstrations of the unbreakable love between parent and child, and of the pain of growing up without a parent present.<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OwNYIww709Q\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\nThe videos reveal a side of mass incarceration that many people don\u2019t get a chance to see. They allow us to bear witness, to be proximate to the very human costs of incarceration. Before I joined Google, I spent years as a human rights lawyer working on criminal justice reform. When I visited women\u2019s prisons, I saw how broken women prisoners were because almost all were mothers to small children. Few received visits from family or children because of how remote women\u2019s prisons usually are. When children did visit, some weren\u2019t allowed to hug or touch their mothers. I also visited detention centers for girls, where many were the daughters of incarcerated mothers. The girls had been trafficked or arrested for running away from group homes or abusive foster placements, and they shared with me the pain of not having a mother there to teach them and protect them. <br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1zGSqaZ655s\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\nThe impact of mass incarceration is generational and devastating. I hope that after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnHDom1MBC4p1ZI6Z4jRfiw\">watching these videos</a>,&nbsp;you\u2019ll choose to learn more about the critical work organizations like <a href=\"http://www.osborneny.org/\">The Osborne Association</a>, <a href=\"http://hourchildren.org/\">Hour Children</a>, and Google.org grantees <a href=\"http://www.essiejusticegroup.org/\">Essie Justice Group</a>, the <a href=\"http://ellabakercenter.org/\">Ella Baker Center</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.eji.org/\">Equal Justice Initiative</a> are doing to support children affected by incarceration and to advance criminal justice reform.

That is not the case recently for the residents of Flint, Michigan, many of whom we now know have been exposed to lead in their tap water. It\u2019s a crisis, one to which the American people readily responded by donating water and resources to help alleviate the immediate pain. But the problem won\u2019t go away quickly, and understanding its extent is both challenging and an absolute necessity. Today, Google.org is providing $250,000 to partners in the Flint community to help, with a special focus on a technical solution for understanding and resolving the crisis for the long term.<br />\n<br />\nFirst, we\u2019re making a <b>$150,000 grant to the University of Michigan-Flint</b> to enable the University of Michigan-Flint to develop a comprehensive data platform that will assist government and community leaders in making more informed decisions about the crisis and providing critical information to citizens. The funds will support student researchers at the University of Michigan, Flint and Ann Arbor campuses, to do this work under the leadership of Professors Mark Allison (Flint) and Jake Abernathy (Ann Arbor) to answer key questions about the crisis and response, such as the probability of lead levels before they are tested. The team plans to develop a platform and app that visualizes the data and also provides the ability for citizens to seek out and request key services, such as reporting concerns about water and requesting testing kits. Google volunteers will provide guidance and mentoring on the technology and product design. <br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re also making a <b>$100,000 donation to the Community Foundation of Greater Flint for the Flint Child Health &amp; Development Fund</b>. The <a href=\"https://www.cfgf.org/cfgf/GoodWork/FlintArea/WaterCrisis/tabid/855/Default.aspx\">Flint Child Health &amp; Development Fund</a> was founded to ensure the long-term health of Flint families, especially newborns to children 6 years old\u2014the group most vulnerable to developmental issues from lead. The Fund is a supplemental resource to state and federal funding and gives grants for childcare-related initiatives such as early childhood education, student support services, continuous access to a pediatric medical home, access to infant and child behavioral health services, and research. <br />\n<br />\nWith Google offices in Ann Arbor and Birmingham, Flint and its residents are also our neighbors. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, a group of 20 Google volunteers went to Flint and volunteered at the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan, where they helped with distributing bottled water and food in the greater Flint area. Around $35,000 has been donated through employees and Google's gift match program to the <a href=\"https://give.corp.google.com/org/54161\">United Way of Genesee County</a> and the <a href=\"https://give.corp.google.com/org/56657\">Flint Water Fund</a> to aid in the crisis, and our employee groups, like the Black Googler Network, continue to explore more ways to help.<br />\n<br />\nAs a native Michigander, I'm proud that we can help our neighbors in Flint. We hope we can support a resolution to this crisis and assist the residents of Flint in getting the resources they need and deserve, both for the short and long term.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Mike Miller, Head of Google Michigan</span>  <span data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"display: none; font-size: 0; line-height: 0; max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">  <!--\n  INSTRUCTIONS\n  Enter info below to be used in google.com/about site blog syndication.

This year, they decided to try something new. - Ed.</i></div>\n<br />\n<i>In August, I announced Alphabet and our new structure and shared my thoughts on how we were thinking about the future of our business. (It is reprinted <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html\">here</a> in case you missed it, as it seems to apply just as much today.) I\u2019m really pleased with how Alphabet is going. I am also very pleased with Sundar\u2019s performance as our new Google CEO. Since the majority of our big bets are in Google, I wanted to give him most of the bully-pulpit here to reflect on Google\u2019s accomplishments and share his vision. In the future, you should expect that Sundar, Sergey and I will use this space to give you a good personal overview of where we are and where we are going.&nbsp;</i><br />\n<i><br />\n</i> <i>- Larry Page, CEO, Alphabet</i><br />\n<br />\n<hr />\n<br />\nWhen Larry and Sergey founded Google in 1998, there were about 300 million people online. By and large, they were sitting in a chair, logging on to a desktop machine, typing searches on a big keyboard connected to a big, bulky monitor. Today, that number is around 3 billion people, many of them searching for information on tiny devices they carry with them wherever they go.<br />\n<br />\nIn many ways, the founding mission of Google back in \u201998\u2014\u201cto organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful\u201d\u2014is even truer and more important to tackle today, in a world where people look to their devices to help organize their day, get them from one place to another, and keep in touch. The mobile phone really has become the remote control for our daily lives, and we\u2019re communicating, consuming, educating, and entertaining ourselves, on our phones, in ways unimaginable just a few years ago. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Knowledge for everyone: search and assistance</b><br />\nAs we said when we announced Alphabet, \u201cthe new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google.\u201d Those opportunities live within our mission, and today we are about one thing above all else: making information and knowledge available for everyone.<br />\n<br />\nThis of course brings us to Search\u2014the very core of this company. It\u2019s easy to take Search for granted after so many years, but it\u2019s amazing to think just how far it has come and still has to go. I still remember the days when 10 bare blue links on a desktop page helped you navigate to different parts of the Internet. Contrast that to today, where the majority of our searches come from mobile, and an increasing number of them via voice. These queries get harder and harder with each passing year\u2014people want more local, more context-specific information, and they want it at their fingertips. So we\u2019ve made it possible for you to search for [Leonardo DiCaprio movies] or [Zika virus] and get a rich panel of facts and visuals. You can also get answers via Google Now\u2014like the weather in your upcoming vacation spot, or when you should leave for the airport\u2014without you even needing to ask the question. <br />\n<br />\nHelping you find information that gets you through your day extends well beyond the classic search query. Think, for example, of the number of photos you and your family have taken throughout your life, all of your memories. Collectively, people will take 1 trillion photos this year with their devices. So we launched Google Photos to make it easier for people to organize their photos and videos, keep them safe, and be able to find them when they want to, on whatever device they are using. Photos launched less than a year ago and already has more than 100 million monthly active users. Or take Google Maps. When you ask us about a location, you don\u2019t just want to know how to get from point A to point B. Depending on the context, you may want to know what time is best to avoid the crowds, whether the store you\u2019re looking for is open right now, or what the best things to do are in a destination you\u2019re visiting for the first time.<br />\n<br />\nBut all of this is just a start. There is still much work to be done to make Search and our Google services more helpful to you throughout your day. You should be able to move seamlessly across Google services in a natural way, and get assistance that understands your context, situation, and needs\u2014all while respecting your privacy and protecting your data. The average parent has different needs than the average college student. Similarly, a user wants different help when in the car versus the living room. Smart assistance should understand all of these things and be helpful at the right time, in the right way.<br />\n<br />\n<b>The power of machine learning and artificial intelligence</b><br />\nA key driver behind all of this work has been our long-term investment in machine learning and AI. It\u2019s what allows you to use your voice to search for information, to translate the web from one language to another, to filter the spam from your inbox, to search for \u201chugs\u201d in your photos and actually pull up pictures of people hugging ... to solve many of the problems we encounter in daily life. It\u2019s what has allowed us to build products that get better over time, making them increasingly useful and helpful.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve been building the best AI team and tools for years, and recent breakthroughs will allow us<br />\nto do even more. This past March, DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo took on Lee Sedol, a legendary Go master, becoming the first program to beat a professional at the most complex game mankind ever devised. The implications for this victory are, literally, game changing\u2014and the ultimate winner is humanity. This is another important step toward creating artificial intelligence that can help us in everything from accomplishing our daily tasks and travels, to eventually tackling even bigger challenges like climate change and cancer diagnosis.<br />\n<br />\n<b>More great content, in more places</b><br />\nIn the early days of the Internet, people thought of information primarily in terms of web pages. Our focus on our core mission has led us to many efforts over the years to improve discovery, creation, and monetization of content\u2014from indexing images, video, and the news, to building platforms like Google Play and YouTube. And with the migration to mobile, people are watching more videos, playing more games, listening to more music, reading more books, and using more apps than ever before.<br />\n<br />\nThat\u2019s why we have worked hard to make YouTube and Google Play useful platforms for discovering and delivering great content from creators and developers to our users, when they want it, on whatever screen is in front of them. Google Play reaches more than 1 billion Android users. And YouTube is the number-one destination for video\u2014over 1 billion users per month visit the site\u2014and ranks among the year\u2019s most downloaded mobile apps. In fact, the amount of time people spend watching videos on YouTube continues to grow rapidly\u2014and more than half of this watchtime now happens on mobile. As we look to the future, we aim to provide more choice to YouTube fans\u2014more ways for them to engage with creators and each other, and more ways for them to get great content. We\u2019ve started down this journey with specialized apps like YouTube Kids, as well as through our YouTube Red subscription service, which allows fans to get all of YouTube without ads, a premium YouTube Music experience and exclusive access to new original series and movies from top YouTube creators like PewDiePie and Lilly Singh.<br />\n<br />\nWe also continue to invest in the mobile web\u2014which is a vital source of traffic for the vast majority of websites. Over this past year, Google has worked closely with publishers, developers, and others in the ecosystem to help make the mobile web a smoother, faster experience for users. A good example is the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project, which we launched as an open-source initiative in partnership with news publishers, to help them create mobile-optimized content that loads instantly everywhere. The other example is Progressive Web Apps (PWA), which combine the best of the web and the best of apps\u2014allowing companies to build mobile sites that load quickly, send push notifications, have home screen icons, and much more. And finally, we continue to invest in improving Chrome on mobile\u2014in the four short years since launch, it has just passed 1 billion monthly active users on mobile.<br />\n<br />\nOf course, great content requires investment. Whether you\u2019re talking about Google\u2019s web search, or a compelling news article you read in The New York Times or The Guardian, or watching a video on YouTube, advertising helps fund content for millions and millions of people. So we work hard to build great ad products that people find useful\u2014and that give revenue back to creators and publishers.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Powerful computing platforms</b><br />\nJust a decade ago, computing was still synonymous with big computers that sat on our desks. Then, over just a few years, the keys to powerful computing\u2014processors and sensors\u2014became so small and cheap that they allowed for the proliferation of supercomputers that fit into our pockets: mobile phones. Android has helped drive this scale: it has more than 1.4 billion 30-day-active devices\u2014and growing. <br />\n<br />\nToday\u2019s proliferation of \u201cscreens\u201d goes well beyond phones, desktops, and tablets. Already, there are exciting developments as screens extend to your car, like Android Auto, or your wrist, like Android Wear. Virtual reality is also showing incredible promise\u2014Google Cardboard has introduced more than 5 million people to the incredible, immersive and educational possibilities of VR.<br />\n<br />\nLooking to the future, the next big step will be for the very concept of the \u201cdevice\u201d to fade away. Over time, the computer itself\u2014whatever its form factor\u2014will be an intelligent assistant helping you through your day. We will move from mobile first to an AI first world.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Enterprise</b><br />\nMost of these computing experiences are very likely to be built in the cloud. The cloud is more secure, more cost effective, and it provides the ability to easily take advantage of the latest technology advances, be it more automated operations, machine learning, or more intelligent office productivity tools.<br />\n<br />\nGoogle started in the cloud and has been investing in infrastructure, data management, analytics, and AI from the very beginning. We now have a broad and growing set of enterprise offerings: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Google Apps, Chromebooks, Android, image recognition, speech translation, maps, machine learning for customers\u2019 proprietary data sets, and more. Our customers like Whirlpool, Land O\u2019Lakes and Spotify are transforming their businesses by using our enterprise productivity suite of Google Apps and Google Cloud Platform services.<br />\n<br />\nAs we look to our long-term investments in our productivity tools supported by our machine learning and artificial intelligence efforts, we see huge opportunities to dramatically improve how people work. Your phone should proactively bring up the right documents, schedule and map your meetings, let people know if you are late, suggest responses to messages, handle your payments and expenses, etc.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Building for everyone</b><br />\nWhether it\u2019s a developer using Google Cloud Platform to power their new application, or a creator finding new income and viewers via YouTube, we believe in leveling the playing field for everyone. The Internet is one of the world\u2019s most powerful equalizers, and we see it as our job to make it available to as many people as possible.<br />\n<br />\nThis belief has been a core Google principle from the very start\u2014remember that Google Search was in the hands of millions long before the idea for Google advertising was born. We work on advertising because it\u2019s what allows us to make our services free; Google Search works the same for anyone with an Internet connection, whether it is in a modern high-rise or a rural schoolhouse.<br />\n<br />\nMaking this possible is a lot more complicated than simply translating a product or launching a local country domain. Poor infrastructure keeps billions of people around the world locked out of all of the possibilities the web may offer them. That\u2019s why we make it possible for there to be a $50 Android phone, or a $100 Chromebook. It\u2019s why this year we launched Maps with turn-by-turn navigation that works even without an Internet connection, and made it possible for people to get faster-loading, streamlined Google Search if they are on a slower network. We want to make sure that no matter who you are or where you are or how advanced the device you are using ... Google works for you.<br />\n<br />\nIn all we do, Google will continue to strive to make sure that remains true\u2014to build technology <u>for everyone</u>. Farmers in Kenya use Google Search to keep up with crop prices and make sure they can make a good living. A classroom in Wisconsin can take a field trip to the Sistine Chapel ... just by holding a pair of Cardboard goggles. People everywhere can use their voices to share new perspectives, and connect with others, by creating and watching videos on YouTube. Information can be shared\u2014knowledge can flow\u2014from anyone, to anywhere. In 17 years, it\u2019s remarkable to me the degree to which the company has stayed true to our original vision for what Google should do, and what we should become.<br />\n<br />\nFor us, technology is not about the devices or the products we build. Those aren\u2019t the end-goals. Technology is a democratizing force, empowering people through information. Google is an information company. It was when it was founded, and it is today.

What if children don\u2019t know a veterinarian, an airplane pilot, a paleontologist, or someone in dozens of other careers? What if they lack access to internships or mentors? Can they ever dream big?<br />\n<br />\nI know from watching my own kids visit me at work, and from the scholars I mentor, that exposure to all kinds of professionals is the key to inspiring young people. When I first found out about Expeditions, I saw its potential for broadening the horizons of the student scholars we help at Starfish Foundation. I envisioned creating virtual reality Expeditions that let kids step into someone\u2019s work day, simply by using phones and Google Cardboard viewers. So that\u2019s what we did.<br />\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o_66nLLWgrU/VyIXfLAH8hI/AAAAAAAAFqk/191Ez-CCj1ksMYPM3x7bF3GHadSLyEFCACLcB/s1600/image01.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"412\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o_66nLLWgrU/VyIXfLAH8hI/AAAAAAAAFqk/191Ez-CCj1ksMYPM3x7bF3GHadSLyEFCACLcB/s640/image01.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Soledad O'Brien with scholars from the Starfish Foundation.</i></td></tr>\n</tbody></table>Working with the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/edu/expeditions/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Expeditions</a> team, we created virtual reality tours that show kids the ins and out of careers they might not ever learn about otherwise. From flying an airplane to testing fossil samples, kids can see with their own eyes exactly what people do in many different scenarios. They can watch Carolyn Brown, director of surgery for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, perform a procedure on a cat. Or join Mark Norell, a paleontology professor with the American Museum of Natural History, as he examines a velociraptor specimen up close. And today, schools participating in the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/edu/expeditions\" target=\"_blank\">Google Expeditions Pioneer Program</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/1p0dtgldB1OeF7b9PjOesJei-IGdFahCoI_d5c2CL6ZU/viewform\" target=\"_blank\">Expeditions beta</a> will be able to go on an Expedition of the Google Mountain View campus to see what it\u2019s like to work at Google.<br />\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-45PvxoAdNTA/VyIX3-n5YqI/AAAAAAAAFqo/frIraC740FM4zvPWr-vPM0tpSKRWcS-uQCLcB/s1600/image00.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-45PvxoAdNTA/VyIX3-n5YqI/AAAAAAAAFqo/frIraC740FM4zvPWr-vPM0tpSKRWcS-uQCLcB/s640/image00.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>A career Expedition on American Airlines Pilot, Pam Torell.

Regular field trips are logistically challenging, and they don\u2019t usually focus on careers. But with Expeditions, teachers can share an experience with students right in the classroom. You can\u2019t fit 30 students in the cockpit of a plane, but you can get a virtual reality tour of one using Expeditions. And today, on \u201cTake Your Kids to Work Day,\u201d there\u2019s no better time to get creative about exposing students to different types of jobs and workplace environments.<br />\n<br />\nChildren won\u2019t know what jobs are possible if they don\u2019t know the careers exist. Rather than just telling them, teachers can actually show them. With these career Expeditions, students can travel outside the classroom walls and be exposed to more ideas, places and opportunities than ever before. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Soledad O\u2019Brien</span> <br />\n<br />\n<div><i>(Cross-posted on the <a href=\"http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2016/04/expeditions-career-tours-can-take-kids.html\">Google for Education Blog</a>)</i></div><br />\n<span data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"display: none; font-size: 0; line-height: 0; max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">   <span class=\"post-image\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KP8iBDEQkQI/VyInM3bFYbI/AAAAAAAASPw/Ae89NIr84L0cv5VSZTeUEs2df68M2uWlwCLcB/s1600/EDU-Expeditions-b-13.png</span> <span class=\"post-author-name\">Soledad O\u2019Brien</span> <span class=\"post-author-title\"></span> <span class=\"post-author-team\"></span> </span>", "id": "2002408436262030978", "updated": "2016-04-28T08:09:09-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/2002408436262030978/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2016-04-28T08:00:00-07:00", "title": "Expeditions career tours can take kids to work, virtually"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/04/ten-years-of-google-translate.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDYxODU2MzY5NTc0Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/8648265465644885541", "content": "Ten years ago, we launched Google Translate. Our goal was to break language barriers and to make the world more accessible. Since then we\u2019ve grown from supporting two languages to 103, and from hundreds of users to hundreds of millions. And just like anyone\u2019s first 10 years, we\u2019ve learned to <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/01/hallo-hola-ola-more-powerful-translate.html\">see and understand</a>, <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/introducing-google-translate-app-for.html\">talk</a>, <a href=\"http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2010/12/listen-to-us-now.html\">listen</a>, <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/new-look-for-google-translate-for.html\">have a conversation</a>, <a href=\"http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/04/statistical-machine-translation-live.html\">write</a>, and <a href=\"http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2014/07/translate-community-help-us-improve.html\">lean on friends for help</a>. <br />\n<br />\nBut what we're most inspired by is how Google Translate connects people in communities around the world, in ways we never could have imagined\u2014like <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tomatoes-google-kelowna-curtis-stone-1.3532564\">two farmers with a shared passion for tomato farming</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/143224771746/i-had-cancer-when-i-was-fourteen-and-went-through\">couple discovering they're pregnant in a foreign country</a>, and a <a href=\"http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2015/10/futbol-translated.html\">young immigrant on his way to soccer stardom</a>. <br />\n<br />\nHere\u2019s a look at Google Translate today, 10 years in:<br />\n<br />\n<b>1. Google Translate helps people make connections.</b><br />\nTranslate can help people help each other, often in the most difficult of times. Recently we visited a community in Canada that is using Translate to break down barriers and make a refugee family feel more welcome:<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL590L5WQmH8duxGC2KkpCrehZRguas-rC\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\n<b>2. There are more than 500 million of you using Google Translate.</b><br />\nThe most common translations are between English and Spanish, Arabic, Russian, Portuguese and Indonesian. <br />\n<br />\n<b>3. Together we translate more than 100 billion words a day.</b><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wIK0JKTQcI8\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\n<b>4. Translations reflect trends and events.</b><br />\nIn addition to common phrases like \u201cI love you,\u201d we also see people looking for translations related to current events and trends. For instance, last year we saw a big spike in translations for the word \"selfie,\u201d and this past week, translations for \"<a href=\"https://translate.google.com/#auto/es/purple%20rain\">purple rain</a>\" spiked by more than 25,000 percent.<br />\n<br />\n<b>5. You\u2019re helping to make Google Translate better with Translate Community.</b><br />\nSo far, 3.5 million people have made 90 million contributions through <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/community?utm_source=about&amp;utm_medium=button&amp;utm_campaign=help_translate\">Translate Community</a>, helping us improve and add new languages to Google Translate. A few properly translated sentences can make a huge difference when faced with a foreign language or country. By reviewing, validating and recommending translations, we\u2019re able to improve the Google Translate on a daily basis. <br />\n<br />\n<b>6. Brazil uses Google Translate more than any other country.</b><br />\nNinety-two percent of our translations come from outside of the United States, with Brazil topping the list. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bXZDXFEGAiM/VyGkEu4Zn8I/AAAAAAAASPU/rxA_4ZL6dAMQ3w5exyqUcZgtrugizGn8gCLcB/s1600/translate2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"223\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bXZDXFEGAiM/VyGkEu4Zn8I/AAAAAAAASPU/rxA_4ZL6dAMQ3w5exyqUcZgtrugizGn8gCLcB/s400/translate2.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><b>7.

You can have a conversation no matter what language you speak.</b><br />\nIn 2011, we first introduced the ability to have a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/translate/answer/6142474?hl=en\">bilingual conversation</a> on Google Translate. The app will recognize which language is being spoken when you\u2019re talking with someone, allowing you to have a natural conversation in <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/about/intl/en_ALL/languages/\">32 languages</a>. <br />\n<br />\n<b>9. You don't need an Internet connection to connect.</b><br />\nMany countries don\u2019t have reliable Internet, so it\u2019s important to be able to translate on the go. You can instantly translate signs and menus <a href=\"https://support.google.com/translate/answer/6142483#languages_available\">offline with Word Lens</a> on both Android and iOS, and translate typed text offline with <a href=\"https://support.google.com/translate/answer/6142473?hl=en\">Android</a>. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zgn9UxvjSb4/VyGkFV1XZTI/AAAAAAAASPY/E2_FbLDul3gFhDfmQ4KtsTjrPFzTHjv6gCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-04-26%2Bat%2B4.19.42%2BPM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"434\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zgn9UxvjSb4/VyGkFV1XZTI/AAAAAAAASPY/E2_FbLDul3gFhDfmQ4KtsTjrPFzTHjv6gCLcB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-04-26%2Bat%2B4.19.42%2BPM.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><b>10.

Check out <a href=\"https://www.google.com/get/sunroof\">Project Sunroof</a>, a solar calculator that estimates the impact and potential savings of installing solar on the roof of your home. Taking Google Earth imagery and overlaying annual sun exposure and weather patterns, Sunroof is able to assess viable roof space for solar panel installation, estimate the value of solar and savings based on local energy costs, and connect you with providers of solar panels in your area. <br />\n<br />\nAs of this week, Sunroof expanded to 42 states across the U.S. (from <a href=\"http://googlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2015/12/should-you-go-solar-just-ask-project.html\">10 states in December</a>), which makes imagery and data available for a solar analysis to 43 million rooftops.

Since methane is a very potent greenhouse gas (GHG), even small leaks can add up to big emissions that can hurt our climate. By attaching methane analyzers to select Street View cars, we\u2019ve driven more than 7,500 miles and have <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/climate/methanemaps\">mapped 4,200+ leaks in 10 cities</a>. What we found ranges from an average of one leak per mile (in Boston) to one leak every 200 miles (in Indianapolis), demonstrating the effectiveness of techniques like using plastic piping instead of steel for pipeline construction. We hope utilities can use this data to prioritize the replacement of gas mains and service lines (like New Jersey\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.pseg.com/info/media/newsreleases/2015/2015-11-16.jsp#.Vw7Y15MrKqD\">PSE&amp;G announced</a> last fall).

In places like the United States, 50 to 70 percent of people with disabilities are unemployed; in developing countries that number increases to 80 to 90 percent. And only 10 percent of people with disabilities in developing countries have access to the assistive devices they need. <br />\n<br />\nLast spring, Google.org <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/google-impact-challenge-disabilities.html\">kicked off the Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities</a>, an open call to global nonprofits who are building transformative technologies for the billion people around the world with disabilities.

But power chairs are expensive and often not covered by insurance, leaving many people limited to manual wheelchairs. <br />\n<br />\nWith their Google.org grant, the <a href=\"http://www.thecenterfordiscovery.org/\">Center for Discovery</a> will continue developing an open source power add-on device, the indieGo, which quickly converts any manual wheelchair into a power chair. The power add-on will provide the mobility and freedom of a power chair for around one-seventh the average cost, and will allow people who mainly use a manual wheelchair to have the option of using power when they need it. The device design will be open sourced to increase its reach\u2014potentially improving mobility for hundreds of thousands of people. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UK80JSiWg_Q/VwyJfJtQ9lI/AAAAAAAASJo/jch4d6qRt5056Gpakvnv1YsfYny9ZeAIQCLcB/s1600/indiego.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UK80JSiWg_Q/VwyJfJtQ9lI/AAAAAAAASJo/jch4d6qRt5056Gpakvnv1YsfYny9ZeAIQCLcB/s640/indiego.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>A young man using the indieGo to greet friends.</i></div>\n<br />\n<b>Perkins School for the Blind, $750,000 Google.org grant</b><br />\nTurn-by-turn GPS navigation allows people with visual impairments to get around, but once they get in vicinity of their destination, they often struggle to find specific locations like bus stops or building entrances that GPS isn\u2019t precise enough to identify. (This is often called the \u201clast 50 feet problem.\u201d) Lacking the detailed information they need to find specific new places, people tend to limit themselves to familiar routes, leading to a less independent lifestyle. <br />\n<br />\nWith the support of Google.org, <a href=\"http://www.perkins.org/\">Perkins School for the Blind</a> is building tools to crowdsource data from people with sight to help people navigate the last 50 feet. Using an app, people will log navigation clues in a standard format, which will be used to create directions that lead vision-impaired people precisely to their intended destination. Perkins School for the Blind is collaborating with transit authorities who will provide access to transportation data and support Perkin\u2019s mission of making public transportation accessible to everyone. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-R4EFA02aCX8/VwyJf9xiFqI/AAAAAAAASJw/R2s4vK3FjUYqeUeWDjIzfB0e4yezBha5wCLcB/s1600/perkins.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"Joann Becker walking near bus stop\" border=\"0\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-R4EFA02aCX8/VwyJf9xiFqI/AAAAAAAASJw/R2s4vK3FjUYqeUeWDjIzfB0e4yezBha5wCLcB/s640/perkins.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\n<i>Perkins School for the Blind employee, Joann Becker, travels by bus.

These images are useful in many ways; for The Nature Conservancy, the data will provide baseline imagery to compare forest growth and regrowth over time.

So of course I had to include them in my doodle on the theme \u201cWhat makes me...me.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nMy goal with my art was to not only turn heads but souls as well\u2014not only for someone to see it and be amazed by it but also to have them understand and connect with it. My drawing explores childhood themes and then moves into reflections on our society. Everything surrounding the word \"Google\" depicts my characteristics. Of all the things I chose to include, the six most special to me are the Symbol of Life (the ankh), the African continent, where everything began for me and my ancestors, the Eye of Horus, the word \"power\" drawn in black, the woman's fist based on one of my favorite artist\u2019s works, and the D.C. flag\u2014because I\u2019m a Washingtonian at heart and I love my city with everything in me!<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mg3mRomPCoo/VvAqL1xkP4I/AAAAAAAASD8/5y8WypH7dzQJJPXH8D18QWUJ4xFe_1d7Q/s1600/Akilah%2BJohnson-DC.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mg3mRomPCoo/VvAqL1xkP4I/AAAAAAAASD8/5y8WypH7dzQJJPXH8D18QWUJ4xFe_1d7Q/s640/Akilah%2BJohnson-DC.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a>I've always been encouraged to pursue art, especially by my teachers\u2014first Baba Camera from Roots, and now my art teacher Zalika Perkins. But participating in Doodle 4 Google gave me an understanding of why art matters and why MY art matters\u2014because it speaks to people. No matter our differences, everyone is touched by art in some way. Winning this competition opened my eyes to the many types of art and the many ways it can resonate with people.

Over the last 10 days in Seoul, South Korea, we\u2019ve been lucky enough to witness some of that incredible excitement firsthand. We've also had the chance to see something that's never happened before: <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/\">DeepMind</a>'s AlphaGo took on and defeated legendary Go player, Lee Sedol (9-dan professional with 18 world titles), marking a major milestone for artificial intelligence.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vfgUcjyMOmM/Vumk5gXD98I/AAAAAAAASDI/frbYidb1u6gTKGcvFOf8iQVsr9PLoRlBQ/s1600/Press%2BCenter%2BOutdoor%2BScreen%2B2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vfgUcjyMOmM/Vumk5gXD98I/AAAAAAAASDI/frbYidb1u6gTKGcvFOf8iQVsr9PLoRlBQ/s640/Press%2BCenter%2BOutdoor%2BScreen%2B2.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Pedestrians checking in on the AlphaGo vs. Lee Sedol Go match on the streets of Seoul (March 13)</i></div><br />\nGo may be one of the oldest games in existence, but the attention to our five-game tournament exceeded even our wildest imaginations. Searches for Go rules and Go boards spiked in the U.S. In China, tens of millions watched live streams of the matches, and the \u201cMan vs. Machine Go Showdown\u201d hashtag saw 200 million pageviews on Sina Weibo. Sales of Go boards even <a href=\"http://www.hankookilbo.com/m/v/3e7deaa26a834f76929a1689ecd388ea\">surged</a> in Korea.<br />\n<br />\nOur public test of AlphaGo, however, was about more than winning at Go. We founded DeepMind in 2010 to create general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) that can learn on its own\u2014and, eventually, be used as a tool to help society solve some of its biggest and most pressing problems, from climate change to disease diagnosis. <br />\n<br />\nLike many researchers before us, we've been developing and testing our algorithms through games. We first revealed <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/01/alphago-machine-learning-game-go.html\">AlphaGo</a> in January\u2014the first AI program that could beat a professional player at the most complex board game mankind has devised, using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning\">deep learning</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning\">reinforcement learning</a>. The <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/alpha-go.html\">ultimate challenge</a> was for AlphaGo to take on the best Go player of the past decade\u2014Lee Sedol. <br />\n<br />\nTo everyone's surprise, including ours, AlphaGo won four of the five games. Commentators noted that AlphaGo played many unprecedented, creative, and even <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/03/sadness-beauty-watching-googles-ai-play-go/\">\u201cbeautiful\u201d</a> moves. Based on our data, AlphaGo\u2019s bold <a href=\"https://youtu.be/l-GsfyVCBu0?t=1h17m50s\">move 37</a> in Game 2 had a 1 in 10,000 chance of being played by a human. Lee countered with innovative moves of his own, such as his <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yCALyQRN3hw?t=3h10m25s\">move 78</a> against AlphaGo in Game 4\u2014again, a 1 in 10,000 chance of being played\u2014which ultimately resulted in a win.<br />\n<br />\nThe final score was 4-1. We're contributing the $1 million in prize money to organizations that support science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education and Go, as well as UNICEF. <br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve learned two important things from this experience. First, this test bodes well for AI\u2019s potential in solving other problems. AlphaGo has the ability to look \u201cglobally\u201d across a board\u2014and find solutions that humans either have been trained not to play or would not consider. This has huge potential for using AlphaGo-like technology to find solutions that humans don\u2019t necessarily see in other areas. Second, while the match has been widely billed as \"man vs. machine,\" AlphaGo is really a human achievement. Lee Sedol and the AlphaGo team both pushed each other toward new ideas, opportunities and solutions\u2014and in the long run that's something we all stand to benefit from.<br />\n<br />\nBut as they say about Go in Korean: \u201cDon\u2019t be arrogant when you win or you\u2019ll lose your luck.\u201d This is just one small, albeit significant, step along the way to making machines smart. We\u2019ve demonstrated that our cutting edge deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to make strong Go and <a href=\"http://googleresearch.blogspot.sg/2015/02/from-pixels-to-actions-human-level.html\">Atari</a> players. Deep neural networks are already used at Google for specific tasks\u2014like <a href=\"http://googleresearch.blogspot.sg/2013/06/improving-photo-search-step-across.html\">image recognition</a>, <a href=\"http://googleresearch.blogspot.sg/2015/08/the-neural-networks-behind-google-voice.html\">speech recognition</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-26/google-turning-its-lucrative-web-search-over-to-ai-machines\">Search ranking</a>.

We\u2019ve seen more than a <a href=\"https://googledataorg.cartodb.com/u/googledata/viz/8642706a-dfef-11e5-9f8a-42010a14800b/embed_map\">3,000 percent increase in global search interest</a>&nbsp;since November, and last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a <a href=\"http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/en/\">Public Health Emergency</a>. The possible correlation with <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/don/8-january-2016-brazil-microcephaly/en/\">Zika, microcephaly and other birth defects</a> is particularly alarming. <br />\n<br />\nBut unlike many other global pandemics, the spread of Zika has been harder to identify, map and contain. It\u2019s believed that <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/symptoms/\">4 in 5 people</a> with the virus don\u2019t show any symptoms, and the primary transmitter for the disease, the <i>Aedes</i> mosquito species, is both widespread and challenging to eliminate. That means that fighting Zika requires raising awareness on how people can protect themselves, as well as supporting organizations who can help drive the development of rapid diagnostics and vaccines. We also have to find better ways to visualize the threat so that public health officials and NGO\u2019s can support communities at risk. <br />\n<br />\nAs a company whose mission is helping people find information, with a lot of experience in analyzing large sets of data, we\u2019re in a good position to help\u2014at scale and at speed. So today we have Google engineers working with UNICEF to analyze data to determine how to map and anticipate the virus. We\u2019ve also made some updates to our products to make Zika information more accessible, and we\u2019re providing <a href=\"https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/what-you-need-know-about-zika-unicef-mosquito-borne-disease/29885\">UNICEF</a> with a $1 million grant to help their efforts on the ground.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Mapping information to help with prevention </b><br />\nA volunteer team of Google engineers, designers, and data scientists is helping UNICEF build a platform to process data from different sources (i.e., weather and travel patterns) in order to visualize potential outbreaks. Ultimately, the goal of this open source platform is to identify the risk of Zika transmission for different regions and help UNICEF, governments and NGO\u2019s decide how and where to focus their time and resources. This set of tools is being prototyped for the Zika response, but will also be applicable to future emergencies. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uvyEpTK7-04/VtfWtd1R-FI/AAAAAAAAR8w/2VG0cRh121Q/s1600/engineers.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uvyEpTK7-04/VtfWtd1R-FI/AAAAAAAAR8w/2VG0cRh121Q/s640/engineers.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><i>Google software engineers John Li and Zora Tung with UNICEF research scientist Manuel Garcia Herranz and UX designer Tanya  Bhandari working on the open source data platform.</i><br />\n<br />\n<b>Supporting UNICEF\u2019s efforts to combat Zika </b><br />\nOur $1 million grant will be used by UNICEF to raise widespread awareness, reduce mosquito populations, support the development of diagnostics and vaccines, and work with communities and governments to prevent Zika transmission.

But it wasn\u2019t long before my internship took me in a completely different direction. The city was <a href=\"http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Anger-tears-prayers-as-black-man-killed-by-1085351.php\">on high alert</a> in the wake of racial discrimination and violence, and Dr. Mack was the VP of the city\u2019s NAACP chapter. At his side, I was soon participating in protests and closed door meetings with city leaders\u2014opening my eyes to non-technical solutions, and setting me off on a path that would eventually lead me to <a href=\"http://google.org/\">Google.org</a>, where today I lead giving projects focused on the Bay Area and on racial justice. <br />\n<br />\nMore recently, incidences of racial violence have again dominated our headlines, with the killing of young men like Tamir Rice and Jordan Davis, the deaths of Michael Brown and Sandra Bland, and countless other acts of injustice. And it isn\u2019t just heartbreaking individual stories. The data is troubling: African Americans are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of whites. An estimated 40 percent of all students expelled from U.S. schools are black, and 30 percent are Latino. Of course, Google and our own industry <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/doing-more-on-diversity.html\">need to do more</a> to promote equality and opportunities for all. <br />\n<br />\nSocial innovators can help us move closer to our ideals of equality and justice. That\u2019s why last year, Google.org launched a new, dedicated effort to support leaders who are doing critical work to end mass incarceration and combat endemic educational inequality for black and brown students. We <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/11/03/google-grants-racial-justice/75096508/\">announced $2.35 million in grants</a> to support leaders like #BlackLivesMatter co-founder <a href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2016/02/08/big-think-patrisse-cullors-on-law-enforcement-violence\">Patrisse Cullors</a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/education/edlife/in-oakland-building-boys-into-men.html?_r=0\">Chris Chatmon</a>, who leads Oakland's African American Male Achievement Initiative; and <a href=\"http://www.equalvoiceforfamilies.org/silicon-valley-de-bug-gets-600k-from-google-for-justice-reform/\">Raj Jayadev</a>, who founded the criminal justice reform organization Silicon Valley De-Bug.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IteqS1GkDWc/Vs_CWU91zjI/AAAAAAAAR4k/DqzhJ3PgMKY/s1600/2T9A5296.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IteqS1GkDWc/Vs_CWU91zjI/AAAAAAAAR4k/DqzhJ3PgMKY/s640/2T9A5296.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><i>Patrisse Cullors, Co-Founder of #BlackLivesMatter, at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkv3F_vRyxQ\">Google.org screening of 3 \u00bd Minutes and 10 bullets</a>,&nbsp;Castro Theatre in San Francisco, Calif. on November 3, 2015.</i><br />\n<br />\nToday, I'm excited to continue that momentum with the addition of four more organizations in this space, totalling $3 million in new grants.

Often it's the primary distribution channel for critical, investigative work that shines a light into the darkest corners of society and the economy\u2014the kind of reporting that exposes wrongdoing, causes upset and brings about change. <br />\n<br />\nUnfortunately there are some out there who want to prevent this kind of reporting\u2014to silence journalism when it\u2019s needed most. A simple, inexpensive distributed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack\">denial of service (DDoS) attack</a> can be carried out by almost anyone with access to a computer\u2014and take a site completely offline before its owners even know they\u2019ve been attacked.<br />\n<br />\nThese attacks threaten free expression and access to information\u2014two of Google\u2019s core values. So a few years ago we created <a href=\"http://g.co/shield\">Project Shield</a>, an effort that uses Google\u2019s security infrastructure to detect and filter attacks on news and human rights websites. Now we\u2019re expanding Project Shield beyond our trusted testers, and opening it up to all the world\u2019s news sites to protect them from DDoS attacks and eliminate DDoS as a form of censorship. <br />\n<br />\nWe learned a lot from our early group of Project Shield testers. Not only have we kept websites online during attacks that otherwise would have taken them offline, we learned crucial information about how these types of attacks happen, and how we can improve our services to defend against them. <br />\n<br />\nWith this expansion, tens of thousands of news sites will have access to Project Shield.

Unfortunately, today, the mobile web isn't living up to the expectations people have for getting the information they need, particularly when it comes to speed. In fact, data shows that people abandon websites after just <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/speed-is-key-optimize-your-mobile-experience.html\">three seconds</a> if the content doesn't load quickly\u2014which is bad not just for people trying to get what they want online, but for the publishers who want those readers to enjoy the content they've created for them. That's why, last October, we joined others across the industry on the <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/introducing-accelerated-mobile-pages.html\">Accelerated Mobile Pages Project</a> (AMP for short), an open source initiative to make the mobile web as fast as possible. <br />\n<br />\nIn just over four months, AMP has come a long way, with hundreds of publishers, scores of technology companies and ad-tech businesses all taking part in this joint mission to improve the mobile web for everyone. And starting today, we\u2019ll make it easy to find AMP webpages in relevant mobile search results, giving you a lightning-fast reading experience for top stories.   <br />\n<br />\nNow when you search for a story or topic on Google from a mobile device, webpages created using AMP will appear when relevant in the Top Stories section of the search results page. Any story you choose to read will load blazingly fast\u2014and it\u2019s easy to scroll through the article without it taking forever to load or jumping all around as you read. It\u2019s also easy to quickly flip through the search results just by swiping from one full-page AMP story to the next.<br />\n<br />\nAMP is great for browsing the web on mobile devices, because webpages built with AMP load an average of four times faster and use 10 times less data than equivalent non-AMP pages. In many cases, they\u2019ll load instantly. It's how reading on the mobile web should be\u2014fast, responsive and fun.  <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v4HwU0Bb2H4/Vs0mLBtKsqI/AAAAAAAAR3c/JfjaZcVl3hc/s1600/AMP_v6_phone_cropped.mov.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v4HwU0Bb2H4/Vs0mLBtKsqI/AAAAAAAAR3c/JfjaZcVl3hc/s640/AMP_v6_phone_cropped.mov.gif\" width=\"384\" /></a></div>While helping people find fast AMP content through Google Search is a significant step, there\u2019s still a lot of work ahead for the <a href=\"http://www.ampproject.org/\">open source AMP Project</a>. Still, it\u2019s been thrilling to see how the industry has come together to work on this common goal of making the mobile web great for everyone.

I was sitting in my 10th grade science class when my teacher asked us: \u201cWhat will you try?\u201d I loved the invitation\u2014and the challenge\u2014that the Google Science Fair offered. It was a chance to use science to do something that could really make a difference in the world.<br />\n<br />\nI had always been curious and interested in science, and knew I wanted to submit a project, but didn\u2019t really know exactly where to begin. I asked my teacher for his advice on selecting a research topic. He encouraged me to choose something that I felt passionate about, or something that outraged me, and told me to look at the world around me for inspiration. So I did. At that time, the Ebola crisis was all over the news. It was a devastating situation and I wanted to help be a part of the solution. I had found my project. <br />\n<br />\nWith the outbreak spreading so quickly, I decided that I wanted to find a way to diagnose the virus earlier so that treatment could be delivered as quickly as possible to those who were affected. I read online about silk\u2019s amazing storage and stabilizing properties, and wondered if I could use silk to transport antibodies that could test for the virus. After many failed attempts (and cutting up lots of cocoons) I finally succeeded in creating a temperature-independent, portable, and inexpensive diagnostic test that could detect the Ebola virus in under 30 minutes. I was really excited that my research could help contribute to saving lives, and I was proud to be selected as the Grand Prize winner a few months later.<br />\n<br />\nAs the 2016 Google Science Fair launches today, I wanted to share a few tips from my own experience: First, as my teacher once guided me to do, look at the world around you for ideas. If you\u2019re stuck, try the <a href=\"http://googlesciencefair.com/make-better-generator/en/\">Make Better Generator</a> to find something that excites or inspires you. Second, find a mentor who\u2019s interested in the same things as you. There are a lot of <a href=\"https://www.googlesciencefair.com/en/participants\">helpful ideas</a> on the GSF site to get you started. And finally, don\u2019t get discouraged\u2014often what first appears like failure can teach you so much more. <br />\n<br />\nI urge other teenagers like me to take this opportunity to find a way to make the world around them better. Every one of us, no matter our age or background, can make a difference\u2014and as young people, we\u2019re not always so afraid to try things that adults think will fail. But change doesn\u2019t happen overnight, and it often starts with a question. So look at the world around you and challenge yourself to make something better.<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYAAOdJcqTQ\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\n<br />\nScience isn\u2019t just a subject\u2014it\u2019s a way to make things better. So I hope you\u2019ll join the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/googlescifair\">conversation</a> and <a href=\"http://googlesciencefair.com/?utm_source=officialgoogleblog&amp;utm_medium=officialgoogleblog&amp;utm_campaign=gsf2016\">enter the Google Science Fair this year</a>.

If you complete the Security Checkup by February 11, you\u2019ll also get <a href=\"http://googledrive.blogspot.com/2016/02/safer-internet-day-2016.html\">2GB of extra Google Drive storage</a>, which can be used across Google Drive, Gmail, and Photos.<br />\n<br />\nSafer Internet Day is a great time to do it, but you can\u2014and should!\u2014take a Security Checkup on a regular basis.

That means no peering eyes can read those emails as they zoom across the web, and you can be confident that the message from your Grandpa in size 48 font (with no punctuation and a few misspellings) is really from him!<br />\n<br />\nHowever, as our <a href=\"https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/saferemail/\">Safer Email Transparency Report</a> explains, these things are not always true when Gmail interacts with other mail services. Today, we\u2019re introducing changes in Gmail on the web to let people know when a received message was not encrypted, if you\u2019re composing a message to a recipient whose email service doesn\u2019t support TLS encryption, or when the sender\u2019s domain couldn\u2019t be authenticated.<br />\n<br />\nHere\u2019s the notice you\u2019ll see in Gmail before you send a message to a service that doesn\u2019t support <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/saferemail/tls/?hl=en\">TLS encryption</a>.

Busting bad advertising practices </b><br />\n<br />\nMalicious advertising \u201cbotnets\u201d try to send phony visitors to websites to make money from online ads. Botnets threaten the businesses of honest advertisers and publishers, and because they\u2019re often made up of devices infected with malware, they put users in harm\u2019s way too. <br />\n<br />\nWe've worked to keep botnets out of our ads systems, cutting them out of advertising revenue, and making it harder to make money from distributing malware and <a href=\"https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/12/year-one-progress-in-fight-against.html\">Unwanted Software</a>.

We need to simplify the way we talk about online security to enable everyone to understand its importance and participate in this conversation.<br />\n<br />\nTo that end, we\u2019re teaming up with <a href=\"https://medium.com/\">Medium</a> to host a virtual roundtable about online security, present and future. Moderated by journalist and security researcher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Poulsen\">Kevin Poulsen</a>, this project aims to present fresh perspectives about online security in a time when our attention is increasingly ruled by the devices we carry with us constantly. We hope you\u2019ll <a href=\"http://me.dm/roundtable\">tune in</a> and check it out.<br />\n<br />\nOnline security and safety are being discussed more often, and with more urgency, than ever before.

It\u2019s not limited to board games either\u2014IBM's <a href=\"https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/download/2303/2165\">Watson</a>&nbsp;[PDF] bested two champions at Jeopardy in 2011, and <a href=\"http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/02/from-pixels-to-actions-human-level.html\">in 2014 our own algorithms learned to play dozens of Atari games</a> just from the <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-data/assets/papers/DeepMindNature14236Paper.pdf\">raw pixel inputs</a>. But to date, Go has thwarted AI researchers; computers still only play Go as well as amateurs. <br />\n<br />\nTraditional AI methods\u2014which construct a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_tree\">search tree</a> over all possible positions\u2014don\u2019t have a chance in Go. So when we set out to crack Go, we took a different approach. We built a system, AlphaGo, that combines an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search\">advanced tree search</a> with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning#Deep_neural_networks\">deep neural networks</a>. These neural networks take a description of the Go board as an input and process it through 12 different network layers containing millions of neuron-like connections.  One neural network, the \u201cpolicy network,\u201d selects the next move to play. The other neural network, the \u201cvalue network,\u201d predicts the winner of the game. <br />\n<br />\nWe trained the neural networks on 30 million moves from games played by human experts, until it could predict the human move 57 percent of the time (the previous record before AlphaGo was <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.3409\">44 percent</a>). But our goal is to beat the best human players, not just mimic them. To do this, AlphaGo learned to discover new strategies for itself, by playing thousands of games between its neural networks, and adjusting the connections using a trial-and-error process known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning\">reinforcement learning</a>. Of course, all of this requires a huge amount of computing power, so we made extensive use of <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\">Google Cloud Platform</a>.<br />\n<br />\nAfter all that training it was time to put AlphaGo to the test. First, we held a tournament between AlphaGo and the other top programs at the forefront of computer Go. AlphaGo won all but one of its 500 games against these programs. So the next step was to invite the reigning three-time European Go champion Fan Hui\u2014an elite professional player who has devoted his life to Go since the age of 12\u2014to our London office for a challenge match. In a closed-doors match last October, AlphaGo won by 5 games to 0. It was the first time a computer program has ever beaten a professional Go player. You can find out more in our paper, which was published in <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7587/full/nature16961.html\">Nature</a> today. <br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SUbqykXVx0A\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\nWhat\u2019s next? In March, AlphaGo will face its ultimate challenge: a five-game challenge match in Seoul against the legendary <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Se-dol\">Lee Sedol</a>\u2014the top Go player in the world over the past decade. <br />\n<br />\nWe are thrilled to have mastered Go and thus achieved one of the <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/05/the-world-of-computer-go/\">grand challenges of AI</a>. However, the most significant aspect of all this for us is that AlphaGo isn\u2019t just an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system\">\u201cexpert\u201d system</a> built with hand-crafted rules; instead it uses general machine learning techniques to figure out for itself how to win at Go. While games are the perfect platform for developing and testing AI algorithms quickly and efficiently, ultimately we want to apply these techniques to important real-world problems. Because the methods we\u2019ve used are general-purpose, our hope is that one day they could be extended to help us address some of society\u2019s toughest and most pressing problems, from climate modelling to complex disease analysis. We\u2019re excited to see what we can use this technology to tackle next!<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Demis Hassabis, Google DeepMind</span>  <span data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"display: none; font-size: 0; line-height: 0; max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"> <span class=\"post-image\">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UM6zXm-cXW4/VqkFrP32nlI/AAAAAAAARzw/HmxeOsYvvqk/s1600/Go-game_hero.jpg</span> <span class=\"post-author-name\">Demis Hassabis</span><span class=\"post-author-team\">Google DeepMind</span> </span>", "id": "4335412002226383829", "updated": "2016-01-27T10:01:42-08:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/4335412002226383829/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2016-01-27T10:01:00-08:00", "title": "AlphaGo: using machine learning to master the ancient game of Go"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/01/unfolding-virtual-journey-cardboard.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDUzOTE4NTE1NjkzCm9mZnNldDogLTI4ODAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/6738691810098357399", "content": "A year and a half ago we introduced Google Cardboard, a simple cardboard viewer that anyone can use to experience mobile virtual reality (VR).

They also keep a lot of what you love about the web\u2014like news sites or mobile apps\u2014free.<br />\n<br />\nBut some ads are just plain bad\u2014like ads that carry malware, cover up content you\u2019re trying to see, or promote fake goods. Bad ads can ruin your entire online experience, a problem we take very seriously. That\u2019s why we have a strict set of <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/6008942?hl=en\">policies</a> for the kinds of ads businesses can run with Google\u2014and why we\u2019ve invested in sophisticated technology and a global team of 1,000+ people dedicated to fighting bad ads. Last year alone we disabled more than 780 million ads for violating our policies\u2014a number that's increased over the years thanks to new protections we've put in place. If you spent one second looking at each of these ads, it\u2019d take you nearly 25 years to see them all!<br />\n<br />\nHere are some of the top areas we focused on in our fight against bad ads in 2015:<br />\n<br />\n<b>Busting bad ads</b><br />\nSome bad ads, like those for products that falsely claim to help with weight loss, mislead people. Others help fraudsters carry out scams, like those that lead to \u201cphishing\u201d sites that trick people into handing over personal information. Through a combination of computer algorithms and people at Google reviewing ads, we\u2019re able to block the vast majority of these bad ads before they ever get shown.

In the full interactive experience, you\u2019ll encounter 10 subplots, three potential ways to view the ending, and 60+ moments where you can decide to follow the story in different ways.

Less than 10 minutes later, the rest of the world started searching. As of today, we\u2019ve seen more than 897 million searches about the city as the world came together to \u201cPray for Paris.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nGlobal showings of support and offerings of help were a key topic in search this year. Following the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_nmOD1lABAABNNM_en\">Nepal earthquake</a>, \u201chow can I help Nepal?\u201d was a top global search. From Somerville, Mass. to Ludwigsberg, Germany, people asked how to volunteer and what to donate. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Searching for perspective</b><br />\nWhile questions around Nepal were similar around the world, the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_iQ-fCFEBAABHhM_en\">migrant crisis in Europe</a> spiked a wider variety of queries. From Italy asking \u201cHow to adopt a Syrian orphan child?\u201d to Germany wondering \u201cWhere are the refugees coming from?\u201d the world turned to Google to understand the situation and what it meant for them. <br />\n<br />\nIn the U.S., the topic of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_ZM8QflEBAAAlMM_en\">guns</a> brought varying questions.

Days of debate and 73 million searches later, \u201cblack and blue dress\u201d topped searches of \u201cwhite and gold dress,\u201d and the matter was settled forever (right?).  <br />\n<br />\nAnd though \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d is just hitting theaters this week, it\u2019s already <a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_mahWFlEBAACePM_en\">taken the Internet by storm</a>(trooper).

With today\u2019s launch, you can now make the albums you send collaborative. People receiving the shared album can join to add their own photos and videos, and also get notifications when new pics are added. You can even save photos and videos from a shared album to your Google Photos library, so that you can hold onto them even if you weren\u2019t the one holding the camera.<br />\n<br />\nBest of all, there\u2019s no setup\u2014select photos, make an album and then send the link off to whomever you\u2019d like.

We see this every day through our Google for Entrepreneurs programs\u2014like <a href=\"https://www.googleforentrepreneurs.com/startup-communities/40forward/\">#40Forward</a>, which works with organizations to increase the representation of female entrepreneurs in startup communities, and our baby-friendly startup school <a href=\"https://www.googleforentrepreneurs.com/startup-communities/campus-for-moms/\">Campus for Moms</a>. Supporting these startups is important because teams with diverse perspectives and experiences\u2014particularly in leadership positions\u2014make better products for users. <br />\n<br />\nBut the data still tells us that women-led startups often struggle to get access to top investors who can help them raise money. Despite women owning 29 percent of U.S. businesses, female-led companies receive <a href=\"http://www.babson.edu/Academics/centers/blank-center/global-research/diana/Documents/diana-project-executive-summary-2014.pdf\">only 3 percent of venture capital</a>\u2014a lifeline for many startups to fund new product development and hiring. <br />\n<br />\nWith this in mind, today we're hosting our first Google Demo Day specifically for startups with female founders. More than 450 companies from 40+ countries applied, and we chose 11 female-led startups to join us in San Francisco for the event. These startups come from all over the world and span a variety of industries\u2014from Kichink, a B2B e-commerce company in Mexico, to ChattingCat, a real-time translation service in South Korea. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eEx8bgGGe1I/Vmhcryv1YwI/AAAAAAAARkU/92ZGHjnC5Uc/s1600/IMG_6152.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"328\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eEx8bgGGe1I/Vmhcryv1YwI/AAAAAAAARkU/92ZGHjnC5Uc/s640/IMG_6152.JPG\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>At today\u2019s event, each startup will have four minutes to pitch their businesses, followed by Q&amp;A with a panel of judges. At the end of the day, the judges will crown a Judges\u2019 Favorite, based on the strength of their business model, their team, and their product. Demo Days aren\u2019t just a time to pitch investors; founders also receive mentoring and feedback from Googlers and Silicon Valley veterans through a series of talks and workshops.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--96rVcELnwE/Vmhcr_t8YSI/AAAAAAAARkQ/I1KdaRn0TSE/s1600/demoday2015_announce_Facebook%2B%25282%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--96rVcELnwE/Vmhcr_t8YSI/AAAAAAAARkQ/I1KdaRn0TSE/s550/demoday2015_announce_Facebook%2B%25282%2529.png\" width=\"550\" /></a></div>Companies from our past two Demo Days have raised $3.5 million from investors who are in attendance, and millions more afterwards. For example, Durham, North Carolina-based beverage entrepreneur Tatiana Birgisson, who won our Demo Day in April, has raised more than $1 million for her energy tea startup <a href=\"http://www.matienergy.com/\">MATI Energy</a>.<br />\n<br />\nBut it's not just the people in the room who can take part in the big day. You can tune in to the live stream on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87atcCjEqWI&amp;feature=youtu.be\">YouTube</a> at 10am PT today to see Demo Day in action. You'll also have the chance to vote for the winner of the \"Game Changer\" Award, an audience favorite trophy. We hope this Demo Day will not only shine a light on the participating startups, but on the exciting companies being built and led by female entrepreneurs everywhere. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Mary Grove, Director of Google for Entrepreneurs</span>  <span data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"display: none; font-size: 0; line-height: 0; max-height: 0; mso-hide: all; overflow: hidden;\"> <span class=\"post-image\">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eEx8bgGGe1I/Vmhcryv1YwI/AAAAAAAARkU/92ZGHjnC5Uc/s1600/IMG_6152.JPG</span> <span class=\"post-author-name\">Mary Grove</span> <span class=\"post-author-title\">Director</span> <span class=\"post-author-team\">Google for Entrepreneurs</span> </span>", "id": "667695285627381934", "updated": "2015-12-09T09:00:02-08:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["diversity", "entrepreneurship"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/667695285627381934/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-12-09T09:00:00-08:00", "title": "Google Demo Day: shining a light on female entrepreneurs"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/12/meet-pixel-c-our-take-on-tablet.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDQ5NTk5MDYyNjU1Cm9mZnNldDogLTI4ODAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/5068151132466400430", "content": "This holiday season, there's no shortage of electronics to choose from.

When the tablet and keyboard are closed together, the keyboard charges wirelessly and automatically\u2014so you never have to worry about it running out of juice.

You get added security benefits, smarter and longer battery life (10+ hours) and Now on Tap at your fingertips.

Google has already committed to purchase more renewable energy than any other company. Now, through a series of new wind and solar projects around the world, we\u2019re one step closer to our commitment to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/27/fact-sheet-white-house-launches-american-business-act-climate-pledge\">triple our purchases of renewable energy by 2025</a> and our goal of powering 100% of our operations with clean energy.  <br />\n<br />\n<b>842 MW of renewable energy around the world</b><br />\nToday\u2019s agreements will add an additional 842 megawatts of renewable energy capacity to power our data centers. Across three countries, we\u2019re nearly doubling the amount of renewable energy we\u2019ve purchased to date. We\u2019re now up to 2 gigawatts\u2014the equivalent to taking nearly 1 million cars off the road. <br />\n<br />\nThese additional 842 megawatts represent a range of locations and technologies, from a wind farm in Sweden to a solar plant in Chile.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jWu24Mz8Hg4/Vl_via28GsI/AAAAAAAARhE/wVA1KMB8Nuc/s1600/gigawatts.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"609\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jWu24Mz8Hg4/Vl_via28GsI/AAAAAAAARhE/wVA1KMB8Nuc/s640/gigawatts.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\nThese long-term contracts range from 10-20 years and provide projects with the financial certainty and scale necessary to build these wind and solar facilities\u2014thus bringing new renewable energy onto the grid in these regions. For our part, these contracts not only help minimize the environmental impact of our services\u2014they also make good business sense by ensuring good prices.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Our commitment to a sustainable energy future</b><br />\nSince we opened our <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/the-dalles/\">very first owned data center</a> in 2006, we\u2019ve been working to promote renewable and sustainable energy use in several ways:<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n<li>First, we\u2019re building the world\u2019s most efficient computer infrastructure by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/green/efficiency/datacenters/\">designing our data centers</a> to use as little energy as possible.</li>\n<li>Second, we're driving the renewables industry forward by fully committing to renewable sources. In 2010, we entered our first large-scale <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/reducing-our-carbon-footprint-with.html\">renewable power purchase agreement</a> with a wind farm in Iowa, and we subsequently <a href=\"https://www.google.com/green/energy/use/#purchasing\">completed</a> a number of similar large-scale energy purchases over the past five years. Today\u2019s announcement is another milestone in this area.</li>\n<li>Third, we've worked with our utility partners to help promote transformation in the utility sector. In 2013 we <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/expanding-options-for-companies-to-buy.html\">created a new program</a> that enables customers like Google to buy large amounts of renewable energy directly from their utilities. Today's announcement includes the <a href=\"http://googlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2015/11/buying-renewable-energy.html\">first solar project enrolled under that program</a>. And this past summer we announced that our newest data center will be on <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/06/a-power-plant-for-internet-our-newest.html\">located on the site of a retiring coal plant</a> and will be 100% renewable powered from day one.</li>\n<li>Fourth, beyond our efforts to power our own operations with renewables, we\u2019ve made separate agreements to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/green/energy/investments/\">fund $2.5 billion</a> into 22 large-scale renewable energy projects over the last five years, from Germany to Kansas to Kenya. These investments have been in some of the largest and most transformative renewable energy projects in the world with a goal to help drive renewable energy development not only as a customer but as an investor, and bring down costs for everyone.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nAnd we\u2019re also working on new technologies and ideas\u2014ranging from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/get/sunroof\">Project Sunroof</a> to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/makani/\">Makani Power</a> to <a href=\"http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2015/11/street-view-gives-you-window-into.html?m=1\">air quality monitoring</a>\u2014that we hope can make a cleaner energy future an option for many more people.<br />\n<br />\nWith world leaders coming together at the <a href=\"http://www.cop21paris.org/\">COP21 UN conference on climate change</a> in Paris this week, there's no better time to focus on renewable energy. We hope that our efforts play a small part in boosting all of us in the race to solve climate change. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Urs H\u00f6lzle, SVP Technical Infrastructure</span>  <span data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"display: none; font-size: 0; line-height: 0; max-height: 0; mso-hide: all; overflow: hidden;\"> <span class=\"post-image\">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ejAFa8wt27A/Vl_0HcYgJuI/AAAAAAAARhQ/LDiVPQbnv1I/s1600/gigawattscrop.png</span> <span class=\"post-author-name\">Urs H\u00f6lzle</span> <span class=\"post-author-title\">SVP</span> <span class=\"post-author-team\">Technical Infrastructure</span> </span>", "id": "3113798211140140788", "updated": "2015-12-03T03:00:11-08:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["energy", "green"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/3113798211140140788/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-12-03T03:00:00-08:00", "title": "Powering the Internet with renewable energy"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/12/on-idpd-working-toward-more-accessible.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDQ5MTc4MTU1MjQxCm9mZnNldDogLTI4ODAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/209028299308542016", "content": "We <a href=\"http://www.google.com/diversity/\">believe</a> in a world built for everyone, which is why we launched the global <a href=\"https://www.google.org/impactchallenge/disabilities/\">Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities</a> earlier this year.

In the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, you\u2019re asking all kinds of questions, from simple queries like \u201chow to cook spaghetti squash\u201c and \u201chow to boil eggs\u201d to advanced topics like \u201cwhat can I make ahead for thanksgiving?\u201d and the very crucial, very daunting \u201cHow do you make turkey gravy?\u201d <br />\n<br />\n<b>Let\u2019s talk turkey</b><br />\nThe top Thanksgiving recipe question, however, is focused on the main dish: \u201cHow to cook a turkey?\u201d Related questions include \u201chow much turkey do you cook per person?\u201d (Answer: there\u2019s math involved but the most important part is making enough for sandwiches for multiple days after), followed quickly by \u201cHow long to cook a turkey?\u201d (answer: more math). <br />\n<br />\nAnd though roasting is still the top trending technique method for cooking the big bird, enterprising (or efficiency-oriented) chefs across the U.S. are also searching for tips on how to smoke and deep-fry their turkeys.

Thanks to Google Street View, we can now share the rich, proud and varied history of our country with anyone who has an Internet connection. With more than 30 historical sites available to explore virtually, people all over the world now have a window into our beautiful Kingdom in the heart of the Middle East.<br />\n<br />\nThroughout the ages, ancient civilizations have left their footprints in Jordan. Reminders of the Silk Road which linked the regions of the world in commerce. Ancient cities, such as the Romans\u2019 Jerash and the Nabateans\u2019 Petra. Significant religious sites, like Mount Nebo and the River Jordan. And, to this day, we continue to discover such footprints. <br />\n<br />\nWith Google Street View, would-be visitors, or those just curious to learn more about our ancient lands, can explore Jordan\u2019s unique historical heritage online. That\u2019s one of the reasons I love this technology. Not only does it connect millions of people from all corners of the world, it provides a lens on the past. And when we understand more about each other\u2019s stories and cultures and histories, we realize that we are more alike than we are different. That\u2019s why we must preserve these treasures for future generations.

Carved by hand into vibrant red, white and pink sandstone cliffs, it has, miraculously, survived earthquakes to withstand the test of time. Film buffs might recognize it from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade when Harrison Ford and Sean Connery joined forces in their quest to find the Holy Grail.

So when we first heard about <i>Episode VII</i>, we started thinking about what a Google tribute to these epic stories might look like: \u201cWouldn't it be cool if there was some sort of<i> Star Wars</i> thingy in Search? The Millennium Falcon in Cardboard would be sweet! What if Google Translate could decipher galactic languages?\"... and on, and on, and on. As this list of ideas grew, so too did the band of passionate engineers and product folks who wanted to build them.<br />\n<br />\nWe reached out to our friends at Lucasfilm and Disney, and since then we\u2019ve been working together on  building <a href=\"http://google.com/starwars\">google.com/starwars</a>. It's a place for fans, by fans, and starting today you can choose the light or the dark side, and then watch your favorite Google apps like Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome and many more transform to reflect your path. And that's just the beginning. We've got more coming between now and opening night\u2014the Millennium Falcon in all its (virtual reality) glory included, so stay tuned.

Nationwide, \u201cbuffet restaurants\u201d were the #1 trending Google Maps term on Thanksgiving Day. But locally, folks were heading in other directions. In Houston, \u201cdoughnut shops\u201d were trending on Thanksgiving. It was \u201cbars\u201d in Chicago\u2014 maybe people needed a break from their families.

Our apps just weren\u2019t smart enough. But in a short amount of time they've gotten much, much smarter. Now, thanks to machine learning, you can do all those things pretty easily, and a lot more.

We hope this will let the machine learning community\u2014everyone from academic researchers, to engineers, to hobbyists\u2014exchange ideas much more quickly, through working code rather than just research papers. And that, in turn, will accelerate research on machine learning, in the end making technology work better for everyone. Bonus: TensorFlow is for more than just machine learning. It may be useful wherever researchers are trying to make sense of very complex data\u2014everything from protein folding to crunching astronomy data.<br />\n<br />\nMachine learning is still in its infancy\u2014computers today still can\u2019t do what a 4-year-old can do effortlessly, like knowing the name of a dinosaur after seeing only a couple examples, or understanding that \u201cI saw the Grand Canyon flying to Chicago\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the canyon is hurtling over the city.

When the story involves a 1940s Hollywood star-turned-inventor who helped develop technologies we all use with our smartphones today \u2026 well, we just have to share it with the world. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://g.co/doodle/pzx7av\">Today on Google\u2019s homepage</a> we\u2019re celebrating Hedy Lamarr, the Austrian-born actress  Hollywood once dubbed \u201cthe most beautiful woman in the world.\u201d  Lamarr\u2019s own story reads like a movie script: bored by the film industry and feeling typecast,  Lamarr was more interested in helping the Allied war effort as World War II broke out than in the roles she was being offered.  She had some background in military munitions (yes, really), and together with a composer friend, George Antheil, used the principles of how pianos worked (yep, pianos) to identify a way to prevent German submarines from jamming Ally radio signals. The patent for \u201cfrequency hopping\u201d Lamarr co-authored laid the groundwork for widely-used technologies like Bluetooth, GPS and wifi that we rely upon daily. <br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that Lamarr has kind of a mythical status at Google, and I was pretty excited at the chance to tell her story in Doodle form. This took some tinkering of my own\u2014after deciding on the movie format as a nod to her Hollywood career, I dug through old fashion illustrations and movie posters to try to capture the look and feel of the 1940s. Sketching storyboards on a yellow notepad helped me figure out how to show Lamarr in very different scenarios\u2014movie star by day, inventor by night\u2014which we then animated and set to the awesome soundtrack created by composer Adam Ever-Hadani.<br />\n<br />\nSo in the spirit of celebrating women in technology everywhere, here\u2019s to Hedy Lamarr, who fused the arts with science and never let herself be typecast. Happy birthday, Hedy, on what would have been your 101st birthday. And thank you.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Jennifer Hom, Doodler </span><br />\n<br />\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BRPb2ZR6GMs/VkApsApE7dI/AAAAAAAARXI/pv-fA8FGPfg/s1600/qBROyuiepJvKmBytbOgYFXGGL_jwY_kXCtnU72cE9Q0W1jZWovszfeCNyqKWZV0xihkSIYOkhK68u619N6fLW-crEGmm-7nd1M__8YX47w%253Ds0.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BRPb2ZR6GMs/VkApsApE7dI/AAAAAAAARXI/pv-fA8FGPfg/s400/qBROyuiepJvKmBytbOgYFXGGL_jwY_kXCtnU72cE9Q0W1jZWovszfeCNyqKWZV0xihkSIYOkhK68u619N6fLW-crEGmm-7nd1M__8YX47w%253Ds0.jpg\" width=\"295\" /></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Day one of sketches and exploration</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kt6aRmpDZMg/VkApxZRyUgI/AAAAAAAARXQ/yJpmrttaIU0/s1600/storyboards.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kt6aRmpDZMg/VkApxZRyUgI/AAAAAAAARXQ/yJpmrttaIU0/s1600/storyboards.jpg\" /></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Storyboard organizing</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p0wM_Fj0Bx0/VkApxW3yQTI/AAAAAAAARXM/CnA76XAeBG8/s1600/hedy.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p0wM_Fj0Bx0/VkApxW3yQTI/AAAAAAAARXM/CnA76XAeBG8/s1600/hedy.gif\" /></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Alternative ending from an early draft</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<br />\n<div data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"border-top: 160px solid blue;\">\n<img src=\"HERO IMAGE URL GOES HERE\" />   <br />\n<div class=\"post-author-name\">\nAuthor Full Name</div>\n<div class=\"post-author-title\">\nAuthor Title</div>\n<div class=\"post-author-team\">\nAuthor Team</div>\n<div class=\"post-quote\">\nHERO QUOTE GOES HERE</div>\n</div>\n", "id": "8368640188242613476", "updated": "2015-11-09T05:48:19-08:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/8368640188242613476/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-11-08T21:11:00-08:00", "title": "Celebrating Hedy Lamarr"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/11/rewriting-code-for-girls-in-cs.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDY0MjI3ODUwMDkzCm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/7401713889406300627", "content": "When it comes to computer science, millions of girls are being left out of the conversation.

So with just days left to perfect a costume for yourself, your kid, your pooch or your partner, here\u2019s a look at some of the top Halloween costume trends across the United States. For more, see&nbsp;<a href=\"http://g.co/frightgeist\">Frightgeist</a>, our Google Trends Halloween hub.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Hair-raising </b><br />\nIf your costume involves a certain familiar \u2018do, prepare to have company. Get-ups based on the bombastic GOP candidate for President are spiking, with the top-related search being \u201cDonald Trump wig.\u201d And don\u2019t go looking for blue or purple hair-dye at the last minute on Saturday: chances are it will already have been bought up by kids dressing up as Disney\u2019s \u201cDescendants\u201d characters Mal and Evie. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xYzxcC83jkI/VjI-5h9OI_I/AAAAAAAARTc/nCAKUD6Mt08/s1600/Beutler_GS_trend-list_Oct28_costume_FB.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"334\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xYzxcC83jkI/VjI-5h9OI_I/AAAAAAAARTc/nCAKUD6Mt08/s640/Beutler_GS_trend-list_Oct28_costume_FB.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>And if you\u2019re aiming for a unique costume, you might want to avoid buns on the side of your head too. \u201cStar Wars\u201d is the second most searched costume nationwide, and within that Princess Leia reigns supreme above Dark Side standbys Stormtrooper and Darth Vader.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Superhero Squad</b><br />\n\u201cSuicide Squad\u201d may not hit box offices until next summer, but one character from the film is already making a killing in costume searches. \u201cHarley Quinn\u201d takes the top search spot nationwide (rival Batman is in fifth place). But Harley and Bruce Wayne are just a few of the superheroes (and super villains) you can look for this weekend: People are also donning their cuffs for Wonder Woman, their creepy facepaint for Joker, their bodysuits for Catwoman, and their half shell as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (T-U-R-T-L-E Power!). Even lesser-known characters like Scarlet Witch, Vision, Wasp are getting a boost from film franchises like \u201cThe Avengers\u201d and \u201cAnt-Man.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<b>Frightful Fidos</b><br />\n\u201cDog costume\u201d is always a top search around Halloween\u2014but not because you\u2019re dressing up as Snoopy or Scooby. No, you\u2019re searching for the cutest costume for your four-legged friend. In addition to being adorable, the top dog costumes are just as \u201cStar Wars\u201d-filled as the top human costumes. We assume that\u2019s because they\u2019ve already got the fur and/or ears to make it work.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wj6kODlya3s/VjI-5LGW55I/AAAAAAAARTU/S2QxRSxmJd8/s1600/Beutler_GS_trend-list_Oct28_dogcostume_FB.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"334\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wj6kODlya3s/VjI-5LGW55I/AAAAAAAARTU/S2QxRSxmJd8/s640/Beutler_GS_trend-list_Oct28_dogcostume_FB.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>If dressing your pooch as Chewy feels like asking for trouble, other popular canine costumes include \u201clion,\u201d \u201cdinosaur,\u201d \u201cshark\u201d and \u2026 <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=olaf+character\">Olaf</a>. Because\u2014ahem\u2014you still can\u2019t let \u201cFrozen\u201d go. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Better together</b><br />\nWhen you want a partner in crime or just want insurance against looking silly solo, couples costumes are the way to go. This year, you\u2019re dressing up as famous pop culture pairs like Bonnie and Clyde (the top couples costume overall), Jasmine and Aladdin, Woody and Jessie&nbsp;from \"Toy Story,\"&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=danny+and+sandy\">Danny and Sandy</a>&nbsp;from \"Grease,\" and Barbie and Ken.

Many people live in areas without existing Internet infrastructure; on an archipelago of over 17,000 islands, with mountains and jungles, it\u2019s difficult to run fiber optic cable or install mobile phone towers. That\u2019s where Loon comes in. Loon balloons act like floating cell phone towers in the sky. Flying on the winds at altitudes twice as high as commercial planes, each one beams a connection down to the ground; as one balloon drifts out of range, another moves in to take its place. We hope this could help local operators extend the coverage of their existing networks, and reach further into rural and remote areas.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-acDuOiI_RIE/VjFTs7L_lzI/AAAAAAAARSw/UfbMVQFwhbE/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"379\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-acDuOiI_RIE/VjFTs7L_lzI/AAAAAAAARSw/UfbMVQFwhbE/s640/pasted%2Bimage%2B0.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>Project Loon balloons travel approximately 20 km above the Earth\u2019s surface in the stratosphere.

For example, <a href=\"http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.sg/2015/02/selamat-datang-android-one-high-quality.html\">Android One</a> phones are helping to make affordable high-quality smartphones more accessible in places where most people first access the Internet on a mobile device. We\u2019ve also built features for when connections are slow or nonexistent, such as <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+google/posts/XZo6qgrNDE9\">Search Lite</a> and <a href=\"http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.sg/2014/12/buffering-wheel-stand-aside-introducing.html\">offline videos on YouTube</a>. And Google Translate for Bahasa and <a href=\"http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.sg/2014/12/say-hello-with-google-translate-in.html\">Sundanese</a> can help knock down the language barrier between Indonesia and the rest of the web.  <br />\n<br />\nThe Internet is still out of reach for too many people, but we\u2019re making progress.

You should have more router options that don\u2019t involve spotty connections, messy cords and complicated settings.&nbsp;That\u2019s why we <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/meet-onhub-new-router-for-new-way-to-wi.html\">introduced</a> the first <a href=\"https://on.google.com/hub/\">OnHub router</a> this summer, designed to be fast, secure and easy to use\u2014not to mention attractive enough to put out in the open, where Wi-Fi works best.

That makes ASUS a great partner, since they design intuitive products that focus on the ways real people use them. Like our first router, the ASUS OnHub comes with faster Wi-Fi, easy set-up, and simple management with the Google On app.<br />\n<br />\nWith the ASUS OnHub, we\u2019re also introducing Wave Control, which lets you boost the Wi-Fi speed for a particular device by simply waving your hand over the top of the ASUS OnHub\u2014great for busy houses.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bvRjd3zc3V8/Vi-dDDdcbjI/AAAAAAAARSE/Iy6AgVjUstQ/s1600/13%2B-%2BWave%2BControl%2Bwith%2Bphone%2Bbeside.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bvRjd3zc3V8/Vi-dDDdcbjI/AAAAAAAARSE/Iy6AgVjUstQ/s640/13%2B-%2BWave%2BControl%2Bwith%2Bphone%2Bbeside.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>OnHub routers are designed to stay fresh and get better over time. So in addition to the new ASUS router, in the coming week we\u2019re rolling out our first software update with several performance improvements, including a new smart antenna algorithm. Phone in the kitchen? Laptop in the living room? OnHub will intelligently select the best combination of antennas to direct Wi-Fi to your devices, based on their location and orientation. The best part is, if you already have an OnHub, your router will automatically update when your network is quiet so it won\u2019t interrupt your connection.

We wanted to give you an update on where things stand as we continue to think about what Google\u2014and all of us\u2014can do to help. <br />\n<br />\nA month ago we invited everyone to make a <a href=\"https://onetoday.google.com/page/refugeerelief\">donation</a> to support the work of organizations providing essential assistance to refugees and migrants. We were amazed that in just over 48 hours people around the world donated \u20ac5M ($5.5. million) to support the work of Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. As promised, we then matched your donations with \u20ac5M in <a href=\"http://google.org/\">Google.org</a> grants to support high-impact projects, like offering wireless connectivity solutions in refugee camps, providing emergency cash transfers to refugees in Jordan and Lebanon, and enabling access to education. Googlers around the world also gave, donating more than \u20ac1.2M (matched by Google) to charities working on the humanitarian efforts.<br />\n<br />\nThese organizations and their staff are doing incredible work in very difficult circumstances, and have the skills and contacts necessary on the ground. With that in mind, we\u2019ve been working with them to better understand how our technology expertise can be put to work, too. One issue identified was the the lack of timely, hyperlocal information for refugees. Working with the <a href=\"http://www.rescue.org/\">International Rescue Committee</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mercycorps.org/\">Mercy Corps</a>, we\u2019ve developed an <a href=\"https://github.com/google/crisis-info-hub\">open source</a> project called \u201c<a href=\"http://refugeeinfo.eu/lesbos\">Crisis Info Hub</a>\u201d to disseminate such information in a lightweight, battery-saving way. Already live in Lesvos (with more locations coming online shortly) and being run by our NGO partners, Crisis Info Hub is providing refugees\u2014<a href=\"http://time.com/4062120/see-how-smartphones-have-become-a-lifeline-for-refugees/\">most of whom carry smartphones</a>\u2014with critical information for their journeys: lodging, transportation, medical facilities, etc. And we\u2019re working to make connectivity in the region more widespread and reliable by partnering with <a href=\"http://www.nethope.org/\">NetHope</a> to deploy robust access solutions where they\u2019re needed most.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rag-z_meTD8/VinQ3nsG1VI/AAAAAAAARRI/c09f8Jbx9A8/s1600/Nexus5_ar.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rag-z_meTD8/VinQ3nsG1VI/AAAAAAAARRI/c09f8Jbx9A8/s400/Nexus5_ar.png\" width=\"221\" /></a><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eCyeTH9_rw0/VinQ3ZFLJhI/AAAAAAAARRM/m5gBQL510hE/s1600/Nexus5_en.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eCyeTH9_rw0/VinQ3ZFLJhI/AAAAAAAARRM/m5gBQL510hE/s400/Nexus5_en.png\" width=\"221\" /></a></div>When refugees travel across different countries, they\u2019re confronted with languages they don\u2019t speak, which can make it even more difficult to know where to turn to access the most basic needs. Just this year, we saw a 5X growth in Arabic translations in Germany, which got us thinking about what we could do to make our products work better for Arabic speakers in these places. We\u2019ve since <a href=\"http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2015/10/two-new-translate-features-coming-your.html\">added Arabic</a> as our 28th language for instant visual translation, enabling immediate, offline translation of signs and other printed text from English or German to Arabic. We\u2019re also asking anyone who knows the languages spoken by refugees or the countries they\u2019re traveling through to help us improve translations through <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/community\">Google Translate Community</a>\u2014our goal is 2 million community contributions.

This year\u2019s theme, \u201cWhat makes me\u2026me,\u201d invites students K-12 to express themselves in the form of a doodle highlighting what makes them unique. <br />\n<br />\nBut wait don\u2019t get out those pencils just yet. This year, there\u2019s a twist.  <br />\n<br />\nDoodle 4 Google is now in its eighth year (if Doodle 4 Google were a kid, it\u2019d be a third grader)\u2014so we decided to mix things up a bit to let kids\u2019 imaginations really run wild. For the first time, there are no constraints on medium: students can cook, build, cut, spin, paint, or mold their doodle\u2013basically use any material they like as long as they incorporate the letters G-O-O-G-L-E. The Doodle team itself has used a variety of unexpected materials over the years; for example, one <a href=\"https://www.google.com/doodles/earth-day-2012\">Earth Day</a>, we grew a bed of flowers to spell out the doodle. So we figured: let\u2019s open the doors for all the creative kids out there do the same.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lFvdQpDktuU/ViAQGJwYuHI/AAAAAAAARPE/tbdUC59feuQ/s1600/Sophie.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lFvdQpDktuU/ViAQGJwYuHI/AAAAAAAARPE/tbdUC59feuQ/s1600/Sophie.jpg\" /></a></div>Here you can see how I decided to express \u201cme\u201d! I made my doodle out of clay, baked it in the oven, and painted it with acrylic paint. The succulent was taken from my garden. See more tips from my team of Doodlers <a href=\"http://google.com/doodle4google/?utm_source=ogb&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=d4g15\">on the Doodle 4 Google website</a>. <br />\n<br />\nWe anticipate a whole lot of creative use of pottery, crochet, cookie dough and more by students (although of course we want all the drawings and paintings too!), so we figured we need some help picking out the winning artwork. We have an amazing group of guest judges: professional basketball player Stephen Curry, astronaut Dr. Yvonne Cagle, director and author BJ Novak, professional soccer player Alex Morgan, Emmy-award winner Julie Bowen and animator Glen Keane (more on the judges <a href=\"http://google.com/doodle4google/judges.html?utm_source=ogb&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=d4g15\">on our site</a>). <br />\n<br />\nTogether, with the Doodle Team, we\u2019ll pick one National Winner who will have their artwork displayed on the Google homepage for millions to see, receive $30,000 towards a college scholarship, and meet and work with the Doodle team on a visit to Mountain View, Calif. Plus, their school will get to spend $50,000 on technology. <br />\n<br />\nSubmissions are open until December 7.

Publishers around the world use the mobile web to reach these readers, but the experience can often leave a lot to be desired. Every time a webpage takes too long to load, they lose a reader\u2014and the opportunity to earn revenue through advertising or subscriptions.  That's because advertisers on these websites have a hard time getting consumers to pay attention to their ads when the pages load so slowly that people abandon them entirely.<br />\n<br />\nToday, after discussions with publishers and technology companies around the world, we\u2019re announcing a new open source initiative called <a href=\"http://www.ampproject.org/\">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a>, which aims to dramatically improve the performance of the mobile web. We want webpages with rich content like video, animations and graphics to work alongside smart ads, and to load instantaneously. We also want the same code to work across multiple platforms and devices so that content can appear everywhere in an instant\u2014no matter what type of phone, tablet or mobile device you\u2019re using. <br />\n<br />\nThe project relies on AMP HTML, a new open framework built entirely out of existing web technologies, which allows websites to build light-weight webpages. To give you a sense of what a faster mobile web might look like, we\u2019ve developed this demo on <a href=\"http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2015/10/accelerated-mobile-pages-in-search.html\">Google Search</a>:<br />\n<video autoplay=\"\" controls=\"\" height=\"720\" loop=\"\" width=\"360\"><br />\n<source src=\"https://www.google.com/images/google-blog-assets/amp-phone-10062015.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source><br />\n</video><br />\nOver time we anticipate that other Google products such as Google News will also integrate AMP HTML pages. And today we\u2019re announcing that nearly 30 publishers from around the world are taking part too. <br />\n<br />\nThis is the start of an exciting collaboration with publishers and technology companies, who have all come together to make the mobile web work better for everyone. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/\">Pinterest</a>, <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a>, <a href=\"https://chartbeat.com/\">Chartbeat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.parsely.com/\">Parse.ly</a>, <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/web-analytics.html\">Adobe Analytics</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a> are among the first group of technology partners planning to integrate AMP HTML pages.<br />\n<br />\nIn the coming months we\u2019ll work with other participants in the project to build more features and functionality focused on some key areas:<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n<li><b>Content</b>: Publishers increasingly rely on rich content like image carousels, maps, social plug-ins, data visualizations, and videos to make their stories more interactive and stand out. They also need to implement ads and analytics in order to monetize the content and to understand what their readers like and dislike. The Accelerated Mobile Pages Project provides an open source approach, allowing publishers to focus on producing great content, while relying on the shared components for high performance and great user experience. The initial technical specification\u2014developed with input and code from our partners in the publishing and technology sectors\u2014is being released today on <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject\">GitHub</a>.</li>\n<li><b>Distribution</b>: Publishers want people to enjoy the great journalism they create anywhere and everywhere, so stories or content produced in Spain can be served in an instant across the globe in, say, Chile.  That  means distribution across all kinds of devices and platforms is crucial. So, as part of this effort, we\u2019ve designed a new approach to caching that allows the publisher to continue to host their content while allowing for efficient distribution through Google's high performance global cache. We intend to open our cache servers to be used by anyone free of charge.</li>\n<li><b>Advertising</b>: Ads help fund free services and content on the web. With Accelerated Mobile Pages, we want to support a comprehensive range of ad formats, ad networks and technologies.  Any sites using AMP HTML will retain their choice of ad networks, as well as any formats that don\u2019t detract from the user experience. It\u2019s also a core goal of the project to support subscriptions and paywalls. We\u2019ll work with publishers and those in the industry to help define the parameters of an ad experience that still provides the speed we\u2019re striving for with AMP.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nWe hope the open nature of Accelerated Mobile Pages will protect the free flow of information by ensuring the mobile web works better and faster for everyone, everywhere.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by David Besbris, Vice President Engineering, Search</span><br />\n<br />\n<div data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"border-top: 160px solid blue;\">\n<img src=\"&lt;path-to-feature-image&gt;/&lt;image-name&gt;.jpg\" /><br />\nWe\u2019re announcing a new open source initiative called Accelerated Mobile Pages, which aims to dramatically improve the performance of the mobile web.</div>\n", "id": "1417241064734090746", "updated": "2015-10-19T10:09:28-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/1417241064734090746/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-10-07T07:00:00-07:00", "title": "Introducing the Accelerated Mobile Pages Project, for a faster, open mobile web"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/the-space-race-is-on-first-google-lunar.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDQ3OTYxNjMwNTIzCm9mZnNldDogLTI4ODAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/5891350854237787467", "content": "For the last eight years, teams from around the world have been racing to win a global competition to land an unmanned spacecraft on the moon successfully. It\u2019s called the Google Lunar XPRIZE, and it\u2019s been going on in labs and universities from Brazil to Japan to Carnegie Mellon. With <a href=\"http://lunar.xprize.org/teams\">16 remaining teams</a> of scientists, explorers and adventurers hard at work designing and fundraising, the race is on to be the first privately-funded moon landing (and to take home a share of the $30 million prize purse that comes with it).<br />\n<br />\nThis week, they all got a little bit closer. Team SpaceIL, a team of engineers based in Israel, has just managed to secure a \u201cticket to the moon\u201d\u2014in the form of an official, verified launch contract\u2014for its spacecraft on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The spacecraft will hitch a ride in a specially designed capsule on the Falcon 9; once separated from the launcher and released from the capsule, it will use navigation sensors to guide it to the lunar surface. Here\u2019s a first look at the craft that will be heading to the moon in 2017:<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wDH-_YNfvhA/VhRxMjL-2nI/AAAAAAAAROw/D0KMAEOd26A/s1600/SpaceIL_spacecraft05.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wDH-_YNfvhA/VhRxMjL-2nI/AAAAAAAAROw/D0KMAEOd26A/s640/SpaceIL_spacecraft05.gif\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><i>An artist\u2019s rendering of SpaceIL\u2019s newly-designed spacecraft</i><br />\n<br />\nAnd this is where the real fun begins. We kicked off this challenge in 2007 to foster innovation and entrepreneurship in space through low-cost, efficient access to the moon. But until now, all the tinkering has been on terra firma. SpaceIL\u2019s securing of a verified launch contract by the December 2015 deadline keeps the competition open to all Google Lunar XPRIZE teams, who now have until the end of 2016 to secure their own launch contracts to head to the moon by the end of 2017. <br />\n<br />\nThe moon is not only our nearest neighbor in space, but also the gateway to the rest of the universe\u2014providing exciting opportunities for discovery, and giving the rest of us a chance to engage more with science, technology and innovation. We hear a lot about \u201cmoonshots\u201d these days, but this is the real thing. <br />\n<br />\nSo, congratulations to SpaceIL for getting to this phase, and to the other 15 teams: the new space race is on! Just like the astronauts, explorers and moonwalkers who came before you, you\u2019re pushing the limits of what\u2019s possible\u2014let\u2019s see who will make history.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Yasemin Denari Southworth, Manager, Cultural Activation &amp; Partnerships</span><br />\n<br />\n<div data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"border-top: 160px solid blue;\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wDH-_YNfvhA/VhRxMjL-2nI/AAAAAAAAROw/D0KMAEOd26A/s1600/SpaceIL_spacecraft05.gif\"><br />\n<br />\nWith 16 remaining teams of scientists, explorers and adventurers hard at work designing and fundraising, the race is on to be the first privately-funded moon landing.<br />\n</div>", "id": "5891350854237787467", "updated": "2015-11-19T11:33:50-08:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/5891350854237787467/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00-07:00", "title": "The space race is on: first Google Lunar XPRIZE team headed to the moon"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/09/smore-to-love-across-all-your-screens.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDQ1ODk5NzIzMDg3Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/2884826186800444284", "content": "From your watch to your phone to your TV, we want to help you stay connected, entertained and informed across all your screens.

Today we\u2019re introducing the latest Nexus treats, both running Marshmallow, sweetened by amazing apps and sandwiched by some cutting-edge hardware (see what we did there?):<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4cAHL4LMNlY\">Nexus 6P</a> is the first all-metal-body Nexus phone. Built in collaboration with Huawei, this 5.7\u201d phone is crafted from aeronautical-grade aluminum, with a USB Type-C port for fast charging, a powerful 64-bit processor, and a 12.3 MP camera sensor with massive 1.55\u00b5m pixels (hello, better photos!). The Nexus 6P starts at $499.</li>\n<li>You\u2019re not the only one who misses your Nexus 5. We\u2019ve joined forces with LG to bring it back with the new <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QLqHZLdt_jE\">Nexus 5X</a>, which gives you great performance in a compact and light package, with a beautiful 5.2\u201d screen and the same 12.3 MP camera and Type-C port as the Nexus 6P. Nexus 5X starts at $379.</li>\n</ul>Both phones include a new fingerprint sensor, Nexus Imprint, which gives you quick and secure access to your phone, as well as use of Android Pay (in the U.S.).

The Pixel C brings together the benefits of a full-size keyboard with the portability of a tablet. The tablet and keyboard attach magnetically (no docking mechanism FTW), so it\u2019s easy to switch between typing and using the touch screen.<br />\n<br />\nAnd if you\u2019re familiar with the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chromebook/pixel/\">Chromebook Pixel</a>, you\u2019ll immediately see the family resemblance: the Pixel C has the same beautiful aluminum design, great display and USB Type-C port. The Pixel C will be available in time for the holidays on the Google Store.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Cast ALL the things</b><br />\nToday we\u2019re introducing two new Chromecast devices. The new <a href=\"http://google.com/chromecast\">Chromecast</a> has a fresh design, and is easier to plug into TVs with crowded ports. It supports the latest Wi-Fi standards and adapts more easily to changing Wi-Fi conditions in your home, so you get higher quality video with less buffering. Most importantly, we added two new colors. ;)<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://google.com/chromecast/speakers\">Chromecast Audio</a> is a small device that plugs into your existing speakers, so you can stream your favorite music, radio and podcasts over Wi-Fi, similar to Chromecast. It works with tons of apps, including Spotify, Pandora and Google Play Music. Just like Chromecast, it works from anywhere in your home with your favorite devices, including Android, iOS, and laptops. And it\u2019s available <a href=\"https://store.google.com/category/tv_and_audio?utm_source=gblog&amp;utm_medium=post_he_2&amp;utm_term=9_29-launches&amp;utm_campaign=9_29-launches\">on the Google Store</a> and other online retailers for just $35\u2014way less than most Wi-Fi speakers today.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve also updated the Chromecast app to make it easier for you to find great things to watch or to play, across the thousands of apps that work with Chromecast\u2014whether you feel like browsing or want to search for a specific TV show or movie. For Cast-enabled apps that aren\u2019t already on your phone, we\u2019ll suggest one for you. The updated Chromecast app is rolling out on Android and iOS over the next few weeks.<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yX6Kkq7hPJY\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\n<b>Your favorite apps... for the whole family </b><br />\nAll your shiny devices get even better when you have great apps to go with them. So we\u2019re making a few updates to Google Play Music and Google Photos.<br />\n<br />\nFirst, Google Play Music will offer a new family plan later this year. Up to six people will be able to use one account for a shared fee of $14.99 a month (instead of $9.99 per person). Get the dance party ready. <br />\n<br />\nSharing is a theme of today\u2019s Google Photos updates, too. We\u2019re adding Chromecast support to give you that old-school slideshow experience\u2014dimmed lights optional. In the U.S., you can now add private labels to your photos to make it easier to search for specific pics of people with things, places or other people\u2014say, that photo of Mom at the Grand Canyon, or of your daughter with her pet bunny. And soon you\u2019ll be able to pool all your photos and videos with friends and family in one place, and get updates as soon as new photos are added.

In the past year, 100 million people in India started using the Internet for the first time. This means there are now more Internet users in India than in every country in the world aside from China. But what's really astounding is the fact that there are still nearly one billion people in India who aren\u2019t online.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019d like to help get these next billion Indians online\u2014so they can access the entire web, and all of its information and opportunity. And not just with any old connection\u2014with fast broadband so they can experience the best of the web. That\u2019s why, today, on the occasion of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to our U.S. headquarters, and in line with his Digital India initiative, we announced a new project to provide high-speed public Wi-Fi in 400 train stations across India.&nbsp;\n<br />\n<br />\nWorking with <a href=\"http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/\">Indian Railways</a>, which operates one of the world's largest railway networks, and <a href=\"http://www.railtelindia.com/\">RailTel</a>, which provides Internet services as RailWire via its extensive fiber network along many of these railway lines, our Access &amp; Energy team plans to bring the first stations online in the coming months. The network will expand quickly to cover 100 of the busiest stations in India before the end of 2016, with the remaining stations following in quick succession.<br />\n<br />\nEven with just the first 100 stations online, this project will make Wi-Fi available for the more than 10 million people who pass through every day.  This will rank it as the largest public Wi-Fi project in India, and among the largest in the world, by number of potential users. It will also be fast\u2014many times faster than what most people in India have access to today, allowing travelers to stream a high definition video while they\u2019re waiting, research their destination, or download some videos, a book or a new game for the journey ahead. Best of all, the service will be free to start, with the long-term goal of making it self-sustainable to allow for expansion to more stations and other places, with RailTel and more partners, in the future.\n<br />\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;\"><tbody>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lNr0L-MzLpw/VghDQxtOyiI/AAAAAAAAF1I/1fKWd0z_ID4/s1600/IndiaWifi-kash.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"444\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lNr0L-MzLpw/VghDQxtOyiI/AAAAAAAAF1I/1fKWd0z_ID4/s640/IndiaWifi-kash.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">This map shows the first 100 stations that will have high-speed Wi-Fi by the end of 2016</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n</div>\nWe think this is an important part of making the Internet both accessible and useful for the more than 300 million Indians already online, and the nearly one billion more who are not.<br />\n<br />\nBut it\u2019s not the only piece.

To help address the challenges of limited bandwidth, we recently <a href=\"http://googleindia.blogspot.sg/2015/06/faster-and-lighter-mobile-web-pages-in.html\">launched</a> a feature that makes mobile webpages load faster and with less data, and we\u2019ve made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn1yG6jyTAM\">YouTube available offline</a> with <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2015/05/io-2015-mobile-revolution.html\">offline Maps coming soon</a>.<br />\n<br />\nTo help make web content more useful for Indians, many of whom don\u2019t speak English, we launched the Indian Language Internet Alliance last year to foster more local language content, and have built greater local language support into our products\u2014including Hindi Voice Search, an improved Hindi keyboard and support for seven Indian languages with the latest versions of Android. And finally, to help all Indians reap the benefits of connectivity, we\u2019ve been ramping up <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYVx15KEEEs\">efforts to help women</a>, who make up <a href=\"http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.in/2014/09/can-internet-enabled-rickshaw-help.html\">just a third</a> of Internet users in India today, get the most from the web.<br />\n<br />\nJust like I did years ago, thousands of young Indians walk through Chennai Central every day, eager to learn, to explore and to seek opportunity.

Perhaps the most interesting\u2014and inspiring\u2014searches about the Pope\u2019s visit are those looking for information on what he has said.

She has been a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science since 2011 and served as president of the National Association of Science Writers in 2009 and 2010. She joins us here today to share her perspective on the Google Science Fair, which is in its fifth edition this year. </i>-Ed.<br />\n<br />\nThis marks my fifth year with the <a href=\"http://www.googlesciencefair.com/\">Google Science Fair</a>. In October 2010, when I had my first conversations with my friends at Google about their idea to create a global online science fair that any kid 13\u201318 could participate in, I thought it sounded pretty cool. But I couldn\u2019t then imagine just how inspiring and powerful such a competition would turn out to be in reality.<br />\n<br />\nAt the time, I hadn\u2019t even been editor in chief of <i>Scientific American </i>for a year, but I had real ambitions to try to do something to make a difference in educating our young people about science. You see, I believe that science is the engine of human prosperity\u2014it\u2019s the way we grapple with some of the world\u2019s most challenging problems, from cures for diseases to living sustainably in a finite world. So I\u2019ve always seen the idea of fostering evidence-based thinking in our next generation of global citizens as vital.<br />\n<br />\nNow, five years later and working with partners LEGO Education, <i>National Geographic</i> and Virgin Galactic, the Google Science Fair has an impressive track record of enabling our world\u2019s young scientists to shine. Over the years, they\u2019ve tackled serious issues, like world hunger and the energy crisis. Their projects have worked on how to diagnose and treat diseases like cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s. They\u2019ve engineered flashlights powered by their hands and plastics made of banana peels. And to date, the fair has provided almost $1 million in scholarships, and sent four grand prize winners on trips around the world to further their scientific passions.<br />\n<br />\nTonight we added some new winners to that list as we recognized and celebrated the 2015 top 20 finalist projects and the bright young scientists behind them:<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The Grand Prize went to <a href=\"http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/08/spotlight-on-young-scientist-olivia.html\">Olivia Hallisey</a> for creating a novel way to detect Ebola.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/08/spotlight-on-young-scientist-girish.html\">Girish Kumar</a> won the Google Technologist Award for helping improve learning through auto-generated study questions.</li>\n<li>The <i>National Geographic</i> Explorer Award went to <a href=\"http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/08/spotlight-on-young-scientist-deepika.html\">Deepika Kurup</a> for her idea to use solar-powered silver to create clean drinking water.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/08/spotlight-on-a-young-scientist-Krtin-Nithiyanandam.html\">Krtin Nithiyanadam</a>\u2019s project focused on improved diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and won him the <i>Scientific American</i> Innovator Award.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/08/spotlight-on-young-scientist-pranav.html\">Pranav Sivakumar</a>'s&nbsp;automated search for gravitationally lensed quasars earned him&nbsp;the Virgin Galactic Pioneer Award.</li>\n<li>And <a href=\"http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/08/spotlight-on-a-young-scientist-anurudh-ganesan.html\">Anurudh Ganesan</a> took home The LEGO Education Builder Award for his unique twist on effectively transporting vaccines.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nIf you didn\u2019t get to tune in, you can still <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nr06jHZYsgA?t=8m59s\">watch the Awards Show live stream</a> and check out the <a href=\"https://www.googlesciencefair.com/en/\">complete list of impressive finalists and winners</a>, including our first ever Inspiring Educator, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2129nPUuCY\">Aydan Meydan</a> from Bosnia and Herzegovina.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ksDiHlESCxY/VgDfxiUqSJI/AAAAAAAARLA/2SueyjizKFM/s1600/2015%2BGoogle%2BScience%2BFair-ALL%2BWINNERS.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"426\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ksDiHlESCxY/VgDfxiUqSJI/AAAAAAAARLA/2SueyjizKFM/s640/2015%2BGoogle%2BScience%2BFair-ALL%2BWINNERS.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\n<br />\nIn all of these finalists and the thousands of submissions from students in 100+ countries, we see something common. These students are inventive, thoughtful, and determined to help make the world a better place. All they need is a chance and a platform to do so. And, unlike some of us adults, they are ready to try things that other people think are \u201cimpossible.\u201d I find them inspiring.<br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s imperative for us to support and encourage our young people to explore and challenge the world around them through scientific discovery. So we\u2019re especially glad that Ahmed Mohamed\u2014the 14-year-old clock maker from Texas\u2014took us up on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/googlescifair/status/644219471469629440\">our invite</a> to attend this year\u2019s event.

Mohamed, who lives in Texas and is Muslim, was arrested on Monday after he brought a clock that he\u2019d made himself to school and it was mistaken for a bomb. In the days that followed, thousands of people expressed their support for Mohamed online with the hashtag #IStandwithAhmed, and he received invitations to visit the White House, MIT, Facebook\u2014and yes, even Google. As more and more people heard about the story, they turned to search with questions like \u201cWhat did Ahmed\u2019s clock look like?\u201d and \u201cWhat was Obama\u2019s response to Ahmed\u2019s clock?\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<b>Nature\u2019s ways</b><br />\nCalifornia has been battling brutal wildfires this year, as the drought has dried up fields and forests across the state.

Searchers turned to the web with questions like \u201cHow does a wildfire create its own weather?\u201d and \u201cWhy are the wildfires getting worse?\u201d But while firefighters worked around the clock up north to stop the inferno, southern California was breaking records for rainfall.

And just like you can sew together different pieces of fabric to make a dress, or choose different items from your closet to create an unexpected outfit, you can also put together code to make something that\u2019s never existed before. <br />\n<br />\nToday, as New York\u2019s Fashion Week kicks off, fashion and technology are coming together in a new way. <a href=\"https://www.madewithcode.com/\">Made with Code</a> and <a href=\"http://www.zacposen.com/\">ZAC Zac Posen</a> are teaming up to show how computer science can push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in the world of fashion. A dress designed by Zac Posen and with designs coded online by teen girls will debut as the finale look of Zac\u2019s show\u2014and hopefully inspire young girls who have an interest in fashion to see what code can help them create. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9oGwWNkZ_-Q/Ve78DYePJlI/AAAAAAAARGo/BvKUXV6aZ14/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%25282%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9oGwWNkZ_-Q/Ve78DYePJlI/AAAAAAAARGo/BvKUXV6aZ14/s640/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%25282%2529.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>Made with Code started with the mission of inspiring girls to try coding and to see it as a means to pursue their dream careers\u2014regardless of what field those careers are in. For this project, girls from organizations like Black Girls Code, the Flatiron School, Girls Who Code and Lower East Side Girls Club, coded designs for an LED dress using an introductory coding project online. Fashion engineer and Made with Code mentor, <a href=\"https://www.madewithcode.com/mentors/\">Maddy Maxey</a>, coded and fabricated the LED technology of the dress, working alongside Zac as he designed. When the dress goes down the runway, it will displays girls\u2019 patterns in 500 LED lights, using a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=micro-controller\">micro controller</a> specially tuned to match Zac\u2019s Spring Summer 2016 runway collection\u2014from Catalina Blue to Acid Yellow. Meanwhile, 50 girls will get seats at the show to see their designs light up the runway.<br />\n<br />\nIn the past year, we\u2019ve seen many encouraging signs that more girls are exploring computer science. More than 5 million coding projects have been tried since Made with Code began a year ago. And Googlers, teen girls and partners like Girls Inc, Technovation and Girl Scouts have thrown 300+ Made with Code <a href=\"https://www.madewithcode.com/community/pdf/get/AMIfv96VBZO5VD4IWWTgwb_pKDa0Royc0dFwLLSAFav0SfKgXmE8U2ES2p77tEwDqUu1KvUaW6c_f_-3yzLnd9hXeFB7dRmNXQ5W7cKuiSRvNLjSLY_p0sc-US4Mj43_JUwf-ySdGuU5y7fqgMYudeh-5DrfUkTBwHTKHHaSORHJiBigH9cGrzwB4BKIozgHIUU3vG9563Rr\">parties</a> across the U.S., reaching tens of thousands teen girls in person. But with less than one percent of high school girls still expressing interest in computer science, it\u2019s obvious we have so much more work to do\u2014so, let\u2019s start now.  After today, girls all over the country can also head to <a href=\"https://www.madewithcode.com/projects/fashion\">madewithcode.com</a> to create their own design. We hope the digital dress inspires more teens to discover what they can make with code.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Pavni Diwanji, VP of engineering for Kids and Families</span>", "id": "2147400224020312118", "updated": "2015-09-15T08:07:18-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["diversity", "education"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/2147400224020312118/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-09-08T09:00:00-07:00", "title": "Dressed in code"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/09/through-google-lens-search-trends.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDQyMzMwOTIyMDc2Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/7970269149108460346", "content": "With the long Labor Day weekend beckoning, we\u2019ll spare you the introduction and dive right into the past week of search trends. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Party at the VMAs</b><br />\nIt\u2019s been nearly a week since it all went down, but given the number of trending topics related to the Sunday evening spectacle known as the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, we feel almost obligated to recap how it played out on Search.

Once upon a time, Google was one destination that you reached from one device: a desktop PC. These days, people interact with Google products across many different platforms, apps and devices\u2014sometimes all in a single day. You expect Google to help you whenever and wherever you need it, whether it\u2019s on your mobile phone, TV, watch, the dashboard in your car, and yes, even a desktop! <br />\n<br />\nToday we\u2019re introducing a new logo and identity family that reflects this reality and shows you when the Google magic is working for you, even on the tiniest screens. As you\u2019ll see, we\u2019ve taken the Google logo and branding, which were originally built for a single desktop browser page, and updated them for a world of seamless computing across an endless number of devices and different kinds of inputs (such as tap, type and talk).<br />\n<br />\nIt doesn\u2019t simply tell you that you\u2019re using Google, but also shows you how Google is working for you. For example, new elements like a colorful Google mic help you identify and interact with Google whether you\u2019re talking, tapping or typing. Meanwhile, we\u2019re bidding adieu to the little blue \u201cg\u201d icon and replacing it with a four-color \u201cG\u201d that matches the logo.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-Gh9Drj62EFw/VeXMk3xcsOI/AAAAAAAAAxw/knYsAcpaABo/s1600/OGB-INSIDER-BLOGS-GoogleLogox2-Animated.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-Gh9Drj62EFw/VeXMk3xcsOI/AAAAAAAAAxw/knYsAcpaABo/s1600/OGB-INSIDER-BLOGS-GoogleLogox2-Animated.gif\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve changed our look and it probably won\u2019t be the last, but we think today\u2019s update is a great reflection of all the ways Google works for you across Search, Maps, Gmail, Chrome and many others. We think we\u2019ve taken the best of Google (simple, uncluttered, colorful, friendly), and recast it not just for the Google of today, but for the Google of the future.<br />\n<br />\nYou\u2019ll see the new design roll out across our products soon.

It is the costliest natural disaster, and one of the deadliest hurricanes, in U.S. history.<br />\n<br />\nAfter rescue efforts began in the immediate aftermath of Katrina, some Googlers wondered how they could connect people with useful information and resources related to the storm. With the help of many third-party organizations, small groups of our employees worked to display <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/seeing-what-katrina-has-wrought.html\">satellite imagery</a> of affected areas in Google Earth and helped build <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/two-new-katrina-search-tools.html\">searchable databases</a> so people could check on the safety of friends and loved ones. These early efforts later became some of the standard actions taken today by the <a href=\"https://www.google.org/crisisresponse/\">Google Crisis Response Team</a> following natural disasters, from hurricanes to earthquakes to tsunamis.<br />\n<br />\nAs the U.S. enters hurricane season again, Katrina remains a stark reminder of the devastation a storm like that can cause. We want to be as prepared and as helpful as possible for the next one\u2014no matter where it hits, or how big it is. So we\u2019re always working to improve our <a href=\"https://www.google.org/crisisresponse/\">Crisis Response</a> efforts to help people stay safe and informed during these events. <br />\n<br />\nWith that in mind, we've launched some improvements to weather forecasts and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/publicalerts/?hl=en\">Public Alerts</a> in Google Search to track storms during this year's U.S. hurricane season. Now, when you search the web for information about particular <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=tropical%20storm%20san%20juan\">storms</a> or tornadoes, you may see: <br />\n<br />\n<ul><li>A map showing your location in relation to the oncoming storm</li>\n<li>Visualizations of its forecasted track, wind severity and arrival time, courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.noaa.gov/\">NOAA</a></li>\n<li>Concise instructions for preparing and staying safe, customized for the estimated intensity of the storm and its arrival time relative to your location, from <a href=\"http://www.fema.gov/\">FEMA</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ready.gov/\">ready.gov</a></li>\n</ul><br />\nThe safety recommendations you receive will be tailored to reflect the current status of the event and your context. For example, if you search for a specific storm when it\u2019s still several days away, you may see a map of the developing weather event and a recommendation to start preparing an emergency kit. If the storm is only hours away from your location, you might receive a reminder to start charging your phone in case power goes out. And if you search when the storm is nearby, you'll get the most urgent information, like how to avoid injury from fast-moving water or flying debris.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5B52VXwUplc/Vd8rgR8fsRI/AAAAAAAAQ_U/40_hQM16a90/s1600/OJPFepyyRzK%2B%25281%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5B52VXwUplc/Vd8rgR8fsRI/AAAAAAAAQ_U/40_hQM16a90/s500/OJPFepyyRzK%2B%25281%2529.png\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i> Tropical storm alert with precise location, wind details and customized safety checklist.

We\u2019ve also made a resolution of our own: to bring the best of Google technology to education.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9Kk4iDTNWPI/VdvQsYkKSKI/AAAAAAAAQz0/EWivKGoa7Tw/s1600/gCf2mGHGYQjPMdGi2J-8I5PtZtfNyqZAXJ5qsSPUkF0Ohl4V4hWhqW_Trtg3VerJu4qJtQ%253Ds2048.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-about-featured=\"\" height=\"216\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9Kk4iDTNWPI/VdvQsYkKSKI/AAAAAAAAQz0/EWivKGoa7Tw/s640/gCf2mGHGYQjPMdGi2J-8I5PtZtfNyqZAXJ5qsSPUkF0Ohl4V4hWhqW_Trtg3VerJu4qJtQ%253Ds2048.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><b>The best of Google, for education</b><br />\nLike many resolutions, ours might sound familiar\u2014and that\u2019s because the <a href=\"http://google.com/edu\">Google for Education </a>team has been working on it for a while. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time with teachers and students, witnessing firsthand how technology is helping in the classroom and learning about challenges that are yet unsolved. With feedback from schools, we\u2019ve improved products like Google Apps for Education and Docs, building in new features specifically useful for education. We\u2019ve also created new learning experiences like <a href=\"http://google.com/edu/classroom\">Google Classroom</a>\u2014a sort of mission control for teachers and students, offering a single place to keep track of all class materials, eliminating paperwork and making it easy for teachers to collaborate with students, and students to collaborate with each other.<br />\n<br />\nSo as part of our resolution this school year, we\u2019re launching some <a href=\"http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/08/head-back-to-school-with-new-features-in-Google-Classroom.html\">new features in Google Classroom</a>. Teachers can now easily ask students questions in Classroom, alongside all the other class materials in the stream. Teachers also told us that they want more ways for students to engage with each other, and flex their critical thinking muscles. So now students can comment on each other\u2019s answers in Classroom and have open-ended discussions. In the next month, we'll also make it possible for teachers to add assignments, due dates and field trips to a shared calendar. <br />\n<br />\n<b>So what\u2019s your resolution?</b><br />\nWe\u2019re sure you\u2019ve already set some big goals for the year ahead\u2014from acing AP Bio to landing that killer internship. Whatever your plans, it can be tough to stick with those goals once assignments and social commitments start to pile up. So we\u2019ve collected <a href=\"https://get.google.com/tips/#!/?category=learn-better\">50+ tips</a> from more than 15 Google products to help you follow through with your resolutions. Here are some ideas:<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oF2uU0a7qZw/VdvRopNUrnI/AAAAAAAAQz8/rmxp28xzQBQ/s1600/55TipsGif.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oF2uU0a7qZw/VdvRopNUrnI/AAAAAAAAQz8/rmxp28xzQBQ/s550/55TipsGif.gif\" width=\"550\" /></a></div><b>Resolution 1. Get (and stay) organized</b><br />\nWhen you\u2019re bogged down by clutter, it can be tough to get stuff done. Make this your year to be more organized. Never miss another study group with help from <a href=\"https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/never-miss-that-weekly-study-group?category=learn-better\">Google Calendar</a>. Use <a href=\"https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/get-your-whole-teams-info-in-one-place?category=learn-better\">Google Sheets</a> to keep all your classmates' info in one place, and better manage your inbox by emailing everyone at once with a <a href=\"https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/Email-your-whole-class-with-just-one-address?category=learn-better\">Google group</a>. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Resolution 2. Get (mentally) fit</b><br />\nPush yourself to take your studies to the next level. Teach yourself how to code with <a href=\"https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/amp-up-your-selfies-with-code?category=learn-better\">Made with Code</a>. Make the most of language class by saving your most used words and phrases with <a href=\"https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/save-your-most-needed-translations-for-language-class?category=learn-better\">Google Translate</a> or <a href=\"https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/do-research-in-a-language-you-don-t-speak?category=learn-better\">magically translating webpages</a> with Google Chrome. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Resolution 3. Get some worldly perspective</b><br />\nNot studying abroad this year? No problem. You can still unleash your inner explorer with <a href=\"https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/tell-your-history-class-what-it-s-like-to-see-the-pyramids?category=learn-better\">Google Maps Treks</a> and visit the Pyramids of Giza or the Great Barrier Reef without leaving your room. Or bring your art history class to life by seeing those masterpieces up close and in perfect detail with <a href=\"https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/study-and-compare-images-for-art-history?category=learn-better\">Cultural Institute</a>. <br />\n<br />\nWe hope these give you new ideas for how you can make this school year your best yet. Over the next few weeks, we\u2019ll be announcing more tips and other updates\u2014so follow along with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=GoogleEdu&amp;src=typd\">#GoogleEdu</a> and on <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+GoogleforEducation\">Google+</a>. We\u2019ll be doing our homework to stick to our resolution, so we can hopefully give you what you need to do the same.

It didn\u2019t take long for the other candidates to take a stand one way or the other on the \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d issue, while searchers turned to the web to learn more about the Amendment and the ongoing debate.

So today, with our partner TP-LINK, we\u2019re launching <a href=\"http://on.google.com/hub\">OnHub</a>, a different kind of router for a new way to Wi-Fi.

A unique antenna design and smart software keep working in the background, automatically adjusting OnHub to avoid interference and keep your network at peak performance.

The Google On app tells you how much bandwidth your devices are using, lets you run a network check, and if there\u2019s an issue with your Wi-Fi, the app offers suggestions to help. And, instead of lost passwords and sticky notes, it even reveals your password with a single tap and lets you text or email it to friends. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Just gets better</b><br />\nOnHub automatically updates with new features and the latest security upgrades, without interrupting your connection. In the future, OnHub can support smart devices that you bring into your home, whether they use Bluetooth\u00ae Smart Ready, Weave, or 802.15.4. We also plan to design new OnHub devices with other hardware partners in the future. Stay tuned for news from our second partner, ASUS, later this year. <br />\n<br />\nStarting today, OnHub is available for pre-order for $199.99 from <a href=\"https://on.google.com/hub/#buy\">online retailers</a> in the U.S. including the Google Store, Amazon, and Walmart.com. It will be available for sale in retail stores in the U.S. and in Canada in the coming weeks. <br />\n<br />\nAt the end of the day, we want our Wi-Fi to just work, so that we can do all the things we love to do online.

Which brings us, naturally, to the next burning question on people\u2019s minds: \u201cIs Donald Trump left-handed?\u201d  File that one under \u201cAugust.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gScARqgpPAI/Vc5CqPf-t_I/AAAAAAAAQwg/g0y56K7PJAo/s1600/CMTbyjrWoAAdWH4.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gScARqgpPAI/Vc5CqPf-t_I/AAAAAAAAQwg/g0y56K7PJAo/s640/CMTbyjrWoAAdWH4.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Abbi Tatton, who searched this week for [left-handed kangaroos].</span><br />\n<br />\n<p data-about-pullquote>It\u2019s time for an A-through-Z of the week\u2019s Google Search trends (see what I did there?).</p>", "id": "3928094247496593891", "updated": "2015-09-10T16:33:10-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/3928094247496593891/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-08-14T13:31:00-07:00", "title": "Through the Google Lens: Search Trends August 8-14"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDQwNDU3MTQzMTk4Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/5960578054368697454", "content": "As Sergey and I wrote in the original founders letter 11 years ago, \u201cGoogle is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.\u201d  As part of that, we also said that you could expect us to make \u201csmaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses.\u201d From the start, we\u2019ve always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have. <br />\n<br />\nWe did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time. Many of those crazy things now have over a billion users, like Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. And we haven\u2019t stopped there.  We are still trying to do things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes. But in the technology industry, where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas, you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant.<br />\n<br />\nOur company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable. So we are creating a new company, called <a href=\"http://abc.xyz/\">Alphabet</a> (<a href=\"https://abc.xyz/\">http://abc.xyz)</a>.  I am really excited to be running Alphabet as CEO with help from my capable partner, Sergey, as President.<br />\n<br />\nWhat is Alphabet?  Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies.  The largest of which, of course, is Google.   This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead.  What do we mean by far afield?  Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences (that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens), and <a href=\"http://www.calicolabs.com/\">Calico</a> (focused on longevity).  Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren\u2019t very related. Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence. In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed. We will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well.  We'll also make sure we have a great CEO for each business, and we\u2019ll determine their compensation.  In addition, with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results, where Google financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of Alphabet businesses as a whole.<br />\n<br />\nThis new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google.  A key part of this is Sundar Pichai. Sundar has been saying the things I would have said (and sometimes better!) for quite some time now, and I\u2019ve been tremendously enjoying our work together. He has really stepped up since October of last year, when he took on product and engineering responsibility for our Internet businesses.  Sergey and I have been super excited about his progress and dedication to the company.  And it is clear to us and our board that it is time for Sundar to be CEO of Google.  I feel very fortunate to have someone as talented as he is to run the slightly slimmed down Google and this frees up time for me to continue to scale our aspirations.  I have been spending quite a bit of time with Sundar, helping him and the company in any way I can, and I will of course continue to do that.  Google itself is also making all sorts of new products, and I know Sundar will always be focused on innovation -- continuing to stretch boundaries.  I know he deeply cares that we can continue to make big strides on our core mission to organize the world's information.  Recent launches like Google Photos and Google Now using machine learning are amazing progress.  Google also has some services that are run with their own identity, like YouTube.  Susan is doing a great job as CEO, running a strong brand and driving incredible growth.<br />\n<br />\nSergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things.  Alphabet will also include our X lab, which incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery effort<a href=\"http://hooli.xyz/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">.</a> We are also stoked about growing our investment arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure.<br />\n<br />\nAlphabet Inc. will replace Google Inc. as the publicly-traded entity and all shares of Google will automatically convert into the same number of shares of Alphabet, with all of the same rights.  Google will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet.  Our two classes of shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq as GOOGL and GOOG.    <br />\n<br />\nFor Sergey and me this is a very exciting new chapter in the life of Google -- the birth of Alphabet. We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search!  We also like that it means alpha-bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!  I should add that we are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related products--the whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands.<br />\n<br />\nWe are excited about\u2026<br />\n<ul><li>Getting more ambitious things done.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Taking the long-term view.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Investing at the scale of the opportunities and resources we see.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Improving the transparency and oversight of what we\u2019re doing.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Making Google even better through greater focus.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>And hopefully...as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can.</li>\n</ul>What could be better?  No wonder we are excited to get to work with everyone in the Alphabet family.  Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re still getting used to the name too!<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Larry Page, CEO</span><br />\n<p data-about-pullquote>Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies.

While we got certain things right, we made a few choices that, in hindsight, we\u2019ve needed to rethink. So over the next few months, we\u2019re going to be making some important changes. Here\u2019s more about what you can expect:<br />\n<br />\n<b>A more focused Google+ experience</b><br />\nGoogle+ is quickly becoming a place where people engage around their shared interests, with the content and people who inspire them. In line with that focus, we\u2019re continuing to add new features like <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+DmitryShapiro/posts/B4M3R6aMkEf?e=-RedirectToSandbox\">Google+ Collections</a>, where you can share and enjoy posts organized by the topics you care about. At the same time, we\u2019ll also move some features that aren\u2019t essential to an interest-based social experience out of Google+.  For example, many elements of Google+ Photos have been moved into the new Google Photos app, and we\u2019re well underway putting location sharing into Hangouts and other apps, where it really belongs. We think changes like these will lead to a more focused, more useful, more engaging Google+.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Using Google without a Google+ profile</b><br />\nPeople have told us that accessing all of their Google stuff with one account makes life a whole lot easier. But we\u2019ve also heard that it doesn\u2019t make sense for your Google+ profile to be your identity in all the other Google products you use.<br />\n<br />\nSo in the coming months, a Google Account will be all you\u2019ll need to share content, communicate with contacts, create a YouTube channel and more, all across Google. YouTube will be one of the first products to make this change, and you can learn more <a href=\"http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2015/07/youtube-comments.html\">on their blog</a>. As always, your underlying Google Account won\u2019t be searchable or followable, unlike public Google+ profiles. And for people who already created Google+ profiles but don\u2019t plan to use Google+ itself, we\u2019ll offer better options for managing and removing those public profiles.<br />\n<br />\nYou\u2019ll see these changes roll out in stages over several months.  While they won\u2019t happen overnight, they\u2019re right for Google\u2019s users\u2014both the people who are on Google+ every single day, and the people who aren\u2019t.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Bradley Horowitz, VP of Streams, Photos, and Sharing </span> ", "id": "31710824981925041", "updated": "2015-07-27T09:00:30-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/31710824981925041/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-07-27T09:00:00-07:00", "title": "Everything in its right place"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/07/rising-to-climate-challenge.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDQyMjgwMjE5ODgxCm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/6595431200387354505", "content": "In less than five months, policymakers from around the world will gather in Paris to finalize a new global agreement on combating climate change. Already, many governments are putting forth ambitious emissions reduction goals. And companies are taking action, too, by reducing their own footprints and investing in clean energy.<br />\n<br />\n<div>Reaching a strong deal in Paris is an absolute and urgent necessity. The data is clear and the science is beyond dispute: a warming planet poses enormous threats to society. <br />\n<br />\nPublic health experts recently <a href=\"http://press.thelancet.com/Climate2Commission.pdf\">warned </a>that climate change threatens to \u201cundermine the last half century of gains in development and global health,\u201d through forces like extreme weather, drought, malnutrition, and disease. The U.S. government has asserted that climate change poses \u201cimmediate risks to U.S. national security,\u201d as increased natural disasters and humanitarian crises fuel instability and violence. And many studies have revealed that critical infrastructure, like electricity and water, is vulnerable to rising sea levels and intensifying storms.</div><div><br />\nClimate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time. Rising to that challenge involves a complex mix of policy, technology, and international cooperation. This won\u2019t be easy, but Google is committed to doing its part.<br />\n<br />\nGoogle has been carbon neutral since 2007. Our data centers, the physical infrastructure behind web services used by billions of people, now get 3.5 times the computing power out of the same amount of electricity, as compared to five years ago. We are also the <a href=\"https://www.sustainablepurchasing.org/summit15/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/06/Summit_2015_Presentation_Slides_Touati_Herve_SPLC-Summit_2015.pdf\">biggest</a> corporate purchaser of renewable power on the planet. Just today at the White House, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fthe-press-office%2F2015%2F07%2F27%2Ffact-sheet-white-house-launches-american-business-act-climate-pledge&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGojwY7JSNOgW4qZA0CVVhAU-dDXA\">we pledged to triple those purchases</a> over the next decade. In addition, we're a major climate-minded investor, so far committing more than $2 billion to clean energy projects, from America\u2019s largest wind farm to Africa\u2019s largest solar power plant. </div><div><br />\nWe're serious about environmental sustainability not because it\u2019s trendy, but because it\u2019s core to our values and also makes good business sense. After all, the cheapest energy is the energy you don\u2019t use in the first place. And in many places clean power is cost-competitive with conventional power.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re making progress, but averting catastrophic climate change will require significant investment and bold innovations. Google and our private-sector peers are ready to lead. But something fundamental is required: clear policy. The global business community needs certainty to bring climate solutions to scale. We need the world\u2019s political leaders to confirm that investments in clean energy are sound, and that the laws and policies meant to enable such investment will be designed for the long term and rooted in what science tells us needs to be done.<br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s encouraging to see the world\u2019s major economies set ambitious climate targets, but it\u2019s time to get a strong international climate agreement on the books. This December in Paris, it\u2019s imperative that policymakers reach a deal that moves us toward a zero-carbon economy. That\u2019s the kind of future that we\u2019re committed to helping build, and that future generations deserve. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman</span></div>", "id": "6595431200387354505", "updated": "2015-09-14T18:23:39-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/6595431200387354505/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-07-27T08:23:00-07:00", "title": "Rising to the climate challenge"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/07/through-google-lens-search-trends-july_24.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDM3Nzg1NTU1NjQ4Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/8119182586527525255", "content": "Anyone up for a look back at the last week on Google Search?

Tune in to Sylvia\u2019s <a href=\"https://camp.withgoogle.com/?utm_source=googleblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=google\">live event at 12 p.m. PT</a> today</i>. -Ed.<br />\n<br />\nThe ocean first got my attention during a family visit to a New Jersey beach when I was three years old\u2014a wave knocked me over! At age 12, a move to the Florida coast made the ocean my backyard, and I loved the abundance of life there\u2014every day I encountered new creatures like starfish, sponges, horseshoe crabs, seaweed, and a wondrous array of small fish that I\u2019d never seen before. I knew from then on that when I grew up I would be a scientist so I could keep exploring, no matter what.<br />\n<br />\nNow I get to share my love for the ocean with a new generation of adventurers as part of Camp Google, a new online camp for curious kids, starting. During each of the four weeks of Camp Google, kids 7-10 can explore different subjects by joining live adventures\u2014from the depths of the Atlantic to the top of one of the world\u2019s most active volcanoes\u2014and doing fun science projects. Today at 12 p.m. PT, National Geographic diver Erika Bergman and I will take kids on the first adventure\u2014a <a href=\"http://camp.withgoogle.com/?utm_source=googleblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=google\">live dive</a> in the Atlantic Ocean. We\u2019ll head to the northernmost part of Florida Reef Tract, the most extensive living coral reef system in North America. Whether it be the Hammerhead Reef or shipwrecks like the Jay Scutti, it will be exciting to see what we\u2019ll find down there!<br />\n<br />\nAfter the dive, kids can get hands-on with a range of activities to help them understand the science behind what they\u2019ve seen underwater. The activities are designed by the Google engineers who map the oceans with Google Earth, and can be done with simple household supplies. For example, we\u2019ll <a href=\"https://camp.withgoogle.com/activities/week1/why-do-some-things-float?utm_source=googleblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=google\">learn about buoyancy</a> and how things float in the ocean in an experiment with eggs, water and salt, and we\u2019ll explore how dolphins use sounds to see underwater by <a href=\"https://camp.withgoogle.com/activities/week1/how-do-dolphins-see-underwater?utm_source=googleblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=google\">building a sonar system</a>. As kids complete these projects, they\u2019ll earn camp badges to celebrate the new skills they learned, like conquering echolocation (not bad for summer vacation!). The activities are designed for kids to do on their own, in groups with their friends, or with their families. <br />\n<br />\nFollowing Ocean Week, kids can jump into Space Week with a NASA astronaut and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce\">VSauce</a> where they will help cook up space food and learn how astronauts eat in space. After that, they\u2019ll head to Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park with a National Park Ranger and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium\">Derek Muller</a> to learn more about how volcanoes form. And camp ends in style with Music Week, where kids can jam alongside <a href=\"http://zendaya.com/\">Zendaya</a> to learn about why music makes us want to bust a move. We hosts can't wait to explore with you this summer, wherever you might be!<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8oMm_q1bpk\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br /></div>\nThe ocean is vast and a lot of it is unexplored\u2014every time I dive into the ocean there\u2019s the possibility of finding something new. I\u2019m excited to share this spirit of discovery with kids everywhere this summer. I hope through our dive and the rest of Camp Google, we can inspire kids to continue asking questions... and get out there to find answers. <br />\n<br />\n<b><i>Update</i> July 15:</b> We heard that some of you weren't able to see the live stream\u2014sorry about the rocky waters.

We\u2019ve built our own <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/efficiency/internal/#servers\">super-efficient servers</a>, invented <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/efficiency/internal/#water-and-cooling\">more efficient ways to cool our data centers</a>, and even used advanced <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/better-data-centers-through-machine.html\">machine learning</a> to squeeze more out of every watt of power we consume. Compared to five years ago, we now get 3.5 times the computing power out of the same amount of energy.<br />\n<br />\nSince the 1960s, Widows Creek has generated power for the region\u2014now the site will be used to power Internet services and bring information to people around the world.

At its best, news communicates truth to power, keeps societies free and open, and leads to more informed decision-making by people and leaders. In the past decade, better technology and an open Internet have led to a revolution in how news is created, distributed, and consumed. And given Google\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/company/\">mission</a> to ensure quality information is accessible and useful everywhere, we want to help ensure that innovation in news leads to a more informed, more democratic world.<br />\n<br />\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve created the <a href=\"https://newslab.withgoogle.com/\">News Lab</a>, a new effort at Google to empower innovation at the intersection of technology and media. Our mission is to collaborate with journalists and entrepreneurs to help build the future of media. And we\u2019re tackling this in three ways: though ensuring our tools are made available to journalists around the world (and that newsrooms know how to use them); by getting helpful Google data sets in the hands of journalists everywhere; and through programs designed to build on some of the biggest opportunities that exist in the media industry today.<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WcjU3b4rDNk\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\n</div><b>Tools for better reporting </b><br />\nFrom Maps to YouTube to Fusion Tables to Earth to Search, we offer many tools that newsrooms can use in their reporting and storytelling.

We\u2019ll post short written and video tutorials and case studies that highlight best practices from top newsrooms around the world.

To help journalists use our data to offer a unique window to the world, last week we <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/06/a-new-window-into-our-world-with-real.html\">announced</a> an update to our Google Trends platform. The new <a href=\"http://google.com/trends\">Google Trends</a> provides journalists with deeper, broader, and real-time data, and incorporates feedback we collected from newsrooms and data journalists around the world. We\u2019re also helping newsrooms around the world tell stories using data, with a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/googletrends\">daily feed</a> of curated Google Trends based on the headlines of the day, and through <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/06/17/google-just-created-a-stunning-visualization-of-how-the-world-searches-for-global-warming/\">partnerships</a> <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/tomphillips/google-election-maps#.xmxG9EjZq\">with</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4fu9XZqGu0\">newsrooms</a> on specific data experiments. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Programs focused on the future of media</b><br />\nWe\u2019re also working with partners to build a series of programs focused on imagining the future of news and information, as well as on empowering new voices in media. One of the opportunities we\u2019re focused on is increasing the number of media startups in the marketplace. We\u2019ve launched partnerships with <a href=\"http://matter.vc/\">Matter</a>, a media accelerator in San Francisco, and <a href=\"http://hackshackers.com/\">Hacks/Hackers</a>, a global community group for developers and journalists, to provide financial support and mentorship from Google engineers that will help these organizations expand their impact to more startups around the world.

Now that mobile technology allows anyone to be a reporter, we want to do our part to ensure that user-generated news content is a positive and game-changing force in media. We\u2019re doing that with <a href=\"http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2015/06/eyewitness-video-on-youtube-your-window.html\">three projects</a>\u2014<a href=\"https://medium.com/@FirstDraft\">First Draft</a>, the <a href=\"http://lab.witness.org/\">WITNESS Media Lab</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOaMIPk5GtosYNi32liVbRg\">YouTube Newswire</a>\u2014each of which aims to make YouTube and other open platforms more useful places for first-hand news content from citizen reporters around the world.<br />\n<br />\nThe News Lab is a global effort, with teams in the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany to start\u2014and we\u2019re also powering the training and research arm of Google\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.digitalnewsinitiative.com/\">Digital News Initiative</a> in Europe. <br />\n<br />\nGoogle has created many technologies and platforms that have engaged the media industry.

Here\u2019s a look at what people were searching for after the tragedy, plus a glimpse into what else was on searchers\u2019 minds this week.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Tragedy in the south</b><br />\nOn Wednesday night, a gunman shot and killed nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, a historic black church in Charleston, S.C. The suspect, Dylann Roof, was arrested Thursday morning, and charged today with nine counts of murder. As people tried to make sense of the story, many turned to the web, leading searches for \u201c<a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Charleston+Shooting&amp;std=20150617&amp;pn=p1#a=20150617-Charleston+Shooting\">Charleston shooting</a>\u201d to climb to more than 5 million. Top questions in the early morning after the shooting include \u201cWhat was the motive of the hate crime shooting in Charleston?\u201d Many were also interested in the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Confederate+flag&amp;std=20150618&amp;pn=p1#a=20150618-Confederate+flag\">Confederate flag</a>, which still flies above the S.C. Capitol building; interest in the flag spiked 20X in the past week in the U.S. as people asked questions like \u201cWhat does the Confederate flag stand for?\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<b>Presidential politics</b><br />\nWe\u2019re still well more than a year away from the 2016 election but the presidential race is already crowded, and getting more so.

Though Bush was the most searched candidate in more than 25 states after his announcement, it didn\u2019t last long. Following Trump\u2019s announcement Tuesday, he became the most searched Republican Presidential candidate in every state in the U.S. Top questions on the newest candidates include \u201cIs Jeb Bush related to George Bush?\u201d (that would be a \u201cyes\u201d) and \u201cWhat is Donald Trump\u2019s net worth?\u201d (he says more than $8 billion; the numbers are <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/06/17/415003043/the-problem-with-donald-trumps-one-page-summary-on-his-wealth\">disputed</a>).<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rqEqEOQli-o/VYShetDkfzI/AAAAAAAAQjE/6bppRB7pkYQ/s1600/DonaldTrumpQs.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rqEqEOQli-o/VYShetDkfzI/AAAAAAAAQjE/6bppRB7pkYQ/s500/DonaldTrumpQs.png\" width=\"500\" /></a></div><b>Must-see TV</b><br />\nThis week was big for sports, with Google\u2019s own hometown team <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Golden+State+Warriors&amp;std=20150616&amp;pn=p1#a=20150616-Golden+State+Warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> beating the Cleveland Cavaliers to win their first NBA Championship title since 1975.

Then perhaps you were one of the 8 million people watching the fifth-season finale of HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d (Spoilers for the show follow.)

One of the top questions about the show was simply \u201cWho died on \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019?\u201d, while others expressed their disbelief by asking \u201cIs Jon Snow dead?\u201d and \u201cIs Stannis dead?\u201d There were also more than 200K searches for <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Lena+Headey&amp;std=20150614&amp;pn=p1#a=20150614-Lena+Headey\">Lena Headley</a>, who plays Cersei Lannister, and another 20K later in the week for <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Rebecca+Van+Cleave&amp;std=20150618&amp;pn=p1#a=20150618-Rebecca+Van+Cleave\">Rebecca Van Cleave</a>, Headley\u2019s body double for a scene where Cersei is forced to walk naked through the streets.

Eventually, my living room became a virtual one, with a network of gamers sharing experiences and discoveries.&nbsp;\n\n<br />\n<br />\nToday, the gaming world is much more diverse than the one I grew up with, and the community has created new formats that have made gaming more collaborative and interactive. On YouTube, gaming has spawned entirely new genres of videos, from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ9bpcdMd_U\">let\u2019s plays</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_aj5ROfakM\">walkthroughs</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq6pGJbd6Iw\">speedruns</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNUcDkNI24o\">cooking</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY6SlRK5SIo\">music videos</a>.

From \"Asteroids\" to \"Zelda,\" more than 25,000 games will each have their own page, a single place for all the best videos and live streams about that title. You\u2019ll also find channels from a wide array of game publishers and YouTube creators.<br />\n<br />\nKeeping up with these games and channels is now super easy, too. Add a game to your collection for quick access whenever you want to check up on the latest videos. Subscribe to a channel, and you'll get a notification as soon as they start a live stream. Uncover new favorites with recommendations based on the games and channels you love.

It also provides more context to help you understand your options and make the right choices for you.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TE6Of4PSLMw/VWvXRK8piUI/AAAAAAAAQXw/m8ig0S1uZck/s1600/AC_Home_US%2B%25281%2529.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TE6Of4PSLMw/VWvXRK8piUI/AAAAAAAAQXw/m8ig0S1uZck/s640/AC_Home_US%2B%25281%2529.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>Here are some of the things you can do with My Account:<br />\n<br />\n<ul><li>Take the <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup\">Privacy Checkup</a> and <a href=\"https://security.google.com/settings/security/secureaccount\">Security Checkup</a>, our simple, step-by-step guides through your most important privacy and security settings.</li>\n<li>Manage the information that can be used from Search, Maps, YouTube and other products to enhance your experience on Google. For example, you can turn on and off settings such as Web and App Activity, which gets you more relevant, faster search results, or Location History, which enables Google Maps and Now to give you tips for a faster commute back home.</li>\n<li>Use the Ads Settings tool to control ads based on your interests and the searches you\u2019ve done.</li>\n<li>Control which apps and sites are connected to your account.</li>\n</ul>We built My Account to be a resource for everyone, even if you don't have a Google Account. Check out your controls at <a href=\"http://myaccount.google.com/\">myaccount.google.com</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Answering your questions about privacy and security </b><br />\nWe listen to feedback from people around the world to better understand their concerns about privacy and security. In addition to My Account, we want to help people find answers to common questions on these topics, such as: \"What data does Google collect? What does Google do with the data it collects? What tools do I have to control my Google experience?\" <br />\n<br />\nOur new site, <a href=\"http://privacy.google.com/\">privacy.google.com</a>, candidly answers these questions, and more. We also explain how we show relevant ads without selling your personal information, how encryption and spam filtering help keep your data safe, and how your information helps customize your experience on Google. Visit this site often to learn about new tools, features, and information that can help you make the choices that are right for you.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TKgOENpOh0E/VWvXRWBAnDI/AAAAAAAAQX0/PJAkReHoysI/s1600/answers%2Bsite.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"389\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TKgOENpOh0E/VWvXRWBAnDI/AAAAAAAAQX0/PJAkReHoysI/s640/answers%2Bsite.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>When you trust your personal information with us, you should expect powerful controls that keep it safe and private as well as useful answers to your questions.

Having a supercomputer in our pocket is now second nature; today more searches on Google come from mobile than from desktop computers, and by <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/there-are-officially-more-mobile-devices-than-people-in-the-world-9780518.html\">some estimates</a> there are more mobile devices than there are people on the planet. For evidence of the mobile revolution, look no further than the growth of Android. There are now more than one billion Android users worldwide\u2014a long way from when we launched the first Android phone back in 2008. And there are 4,000 unique Android devices on the market, from more than 400 manufacturers and over 500 carriers.<br />\n<br />\nThe devices themselves have changed a lot, too. In today\u2019s multi-screen world, you can now use Android on your phone, your tablet, your wrist, in your car and in your living room, and move seamlessly between each. Many of these new form factors have arrived just in the last year. You can now choose from seven different Android Wear watches, not to mention bands, styles, and more than 1,500 watch faces built by developers.<br />\n<br />\nBy the end of this year, 35 car models will offer Android Auto, helping you access Search, Maps, music and other information through your car\u2019s controls. And the first sets running Android TV have now arrived. <br />\n<br />\nWith all of these new places and devices for people to use Android, developers have even more opportunities to build the apps that people use for education and engagement and entertainment. So today we talked about the new tools and features we\u2019re giving them to build more powerful experiences on the Android platform.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q3Q3Y93BMe4/VWc8kiyHdDI/AAAAAAAAQXE/C8EcsBp5m6c/s1600/device-lineup-2015.001.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q3Q3Y93BMe4/VWc8kiyHdDI/AAAAAAAAQXE/C8EcsBp5m6c/s600/device-lineup-2015.001.png\" width=\"600\" /></a></div><b>M is for more performance and an improved user experience</b><br />\nAndroid M is the most powerful Android release yet, with <a href=\"http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2015/05/android-m-developer-preview-tools.html\">hundreds</a> of improvements made to the platform. Among the highlights, we\u2019ve improved battery life and streamlined permissions for apps to make it easier for you to decide what information the apps on your phone can use. We previewed <a href=\"http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2015/05/pay-your-way-with-android.html\">Android Pay</a>, which lets you pay for things with your phone, without even opening an app. And we\u2019re making it much easier to find information in apps, as well as making some important updates to Google Now (more on that below!).<br />\n<br />\n<b>Organizing the world\u2019s information, better</b><br />\nYour mobile phone packs a lot of information, but it\u2019s not always easy to find that nugget of information when you need it\u2014as you know if you\u2019ve ever tried to navigate your email, organize hundreds of photos across devices, or search for restaurant reviews when you\u2019re chatting about dinner plans with friends. Luckily, finding and organizing information is something Google is good at (some might even call it our <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=google%20mission\">mission</a>). <br />\n<br />\nSo as part of M release, we\u2019re <a href=\"http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2015/05/now-on-tap.html\">expanding Google Now</a>&nbsp;to give people on-demand assistance in the moment they need it\u2014like seeing if there\u2019s an open table at a new restaurant or when and where \u201cPitch Perfect 2\u201d is playing\u2014no matter where you are on your phone. We\u2019re also making it much easier to <a href=\"http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2014/06/more-apps-in-google-searchnow-even.html\">find new apps and in-app content</a>\u2014which is good news for both users and developers.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve also put our years of research into machine learning to work in other ways, making Search more useful and your <a href=\"http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/thanks-to-you-inbox-by-gmail-is-now.html\">inbox more insightful</a>. And now it\u2019s also helping you make sense of all your photos. Today we launched a <a href=\"//googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/picture-this-fresh-approach-to-photos.html\">new Photos app</a>&nbsp;that gives you a single place for all your photos and videos, and helps you sort through them more quickly, bring them to life in cool new ways, and share them however you choose.<br />\n<br />\n<b>A new platform for the Internet of Things</b><br />\nWe\u2019re surrounded by devices, but they often exist independently of each other. Our day-to-day lives will be much simpler when these technologies can talk to each other\u2014if our recipe app, for example, could communicate with our smart oven to turn the temperature to exactly the right setting. \u200bOr outside the home\u2014from transportation systems that notify commuters of schedule changes, to farms where harvesters and irrigation systems are controlled from phones. \u200b<br />\n<br />\nBut many roadblocks remain\u2014the user experience is inconsistent and confusing, manufacturers often redo their work for every device, devices don\u2019t interoperate, and developers often have no way to create great experiences across devices.<br />\n<br />\nEnter <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/brillo\">Project Brillo</a>, a new platform derived from Android that lets developers and manufacturers build connected devices. As part of Brillo, we\u2019re introducing a communications protocol (Weave) developed in partnership with Nest, a set of developer APIs, a core set of schemas and a certification program to ensure device and app interoperability.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough it will launch later this year, we previewed Brillo today because we\u2019re committed to fostering a vibrant ecosystem in which we all work together to move the industry forward.<br />\n<br />\n<b>New mobile experiences</b><br />\nMobile has evolved so much in the past few years, with connected screens for different experiences depending on your needs. But we are just at the start of what will prove to be a much more immersive mobile experience. At last year\u2019s I/O we introduced <a href=\"https://g.co/cardboard\">Cardboard</a>, which lets you turn your phone into a virtual reality experience. Now there are more than 500 <a href=\"https://g.co/cardboardapps\">Cardboard apps</a> for film, games, tours and learning, and more than 1 million Cardboard viewers have been shipped. Today we announced iOS support for developers and debuted <a href=\"https://g.co/expeditions\">Google Expeditions</a>, which lets students take virtual trips with Cardboard to places like the moon and underwater. We also shared a preview of <a href=\"https://g.co/jump\">Jump</a>, which lets you capture the world in video that you can step inside of. <br />\n<br />\n<b>The next billion users</b><br />\nThe first billion users of the Internet came online through desktops. The next billion are taking a different path to computing\u2014coming online through mobile and smartphones\u2014and present a unique set of opportunities and challenges. We\u2019re working hard on ensure these people have a great experience across our products. <br />\n<br />\nIn addition to making devices more affordable with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chromebook/\">Chromebooks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.android.com/intl/en_us/one/\">Android One</a> (now in seven countries), we\u2019re making changes to ensure that our software works even where there aren\u2019t great Internet connections. We\u2019ve launched a <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+google/posts/XZo6qgrNDE9\">streamlined version of our Search results page</a> in 13 countries, and 73 million people now use <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2392284?hl=en\">data saver mode</a> in Chrome to browse the web more efficiently.

Humankind has already taken trillions of photos and will take another <a href=\"http://mylio.com/one-trillion-photos-in-2015/\">trillion</a> this year alone.<br />\n<br />\nBut the more moments we capture, the more challenging it becomes to relive those memories. Photos and videos become littered across mobile devices, old computers, hard drives and online services (which are constantly running out of space). It\u2019s almost impossible to find that one photo right at the moment you need it, and sharing a bunch of photos at once is frustrating, often requiring special apps and logins. <br />\n<br />\nWe wanted to do better. So today we\u2019re introducing Google Photos\u2014a new, standalone product that gives you a home for all your photos and videos, helps you organize and bring your moments to life, and lets you share and save what matters.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bpj2B0dA6O8/VWc3o7gHpWI/AAAAAAAAQVo/4hjit3Bgc8E/s1600/all-three-v4.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bpj2B0dA6O8/VWc3o7gHpWI/AAAAAAAAQVo/4hjit3Bgc8E/s640/all-three-v4.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><b>A home for all your photos and videos</b><br />\nGoogle Photos gives you a single, private place to keep a lifetime of memories, and access them from any device. They\u2019re automatically backed up and synced, so you can have peace of mind that your photos are safe, available across all your devices.  <br />\n<br />\nAnd when we say a lifetime of memories, we really mean it. With Google Photos, you can now backup and store unlimited, high-quality photos and videos, for free. We maintain the original resolution up to 16MP for photos, and 1080p high-definition for videos, and store compressed versions of the photos and videos in beautiful, print-quality resolution. For all the storage details, visit our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/photos/?p=storage\">help center</a>.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-78HNKLW30XA/VWc33QtCnbI/AAAAAAAAQV8/iRt-YdXHMps/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-26%2Bat%2B13.48.23.png\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"177\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-78HNKLW30XA/VWc33QtCnbI/AAAAAAAAQV8/iRt-YdXHMps/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-26%2Bat%2B13.48.23.png\" width=\"316\" /></a><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ymD58W0uROw/VWc3-M3oNNI/AAAAAAAAQWY/HLbEjap3Gi0/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-26%2Bat%2B13.49.11.png\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"177\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ymD58W0uROw/VWc3-M3oNNI/AAAAAAAAQWY/HLbEjap3Gi0/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-26%2Bat%2B13.49.11.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><b>Organize and bring your moments to life </b><br />\nGoogle Photos automatically organizes your memories by the people, places, and things that matter. You don\u2019t have to tag or label any of them, and you don\u2019t need to laboriously create albums. When you want to find a particular shot, with a simple search you can instantly find any photo\u2014whether it\u2019s your dog, your daughter\u2019s birthday party, or your favorite beach in Santa Barbara. And all of this auto-grouping is private, for your eyes only.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VZRWvtu-ErM/VWc3-C3ChqI/AAAAAAAAQWc/Z-LxQDjo25c/s1600/slide8a_framed.png\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VZRWvtu-ErM/VWc3-C3ChqI/AAAAAAAAQWc/Z-LxQDjo25c/s400/slide8a_framed.png\" width=\"237\" /></a><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BXfYhnDBqA0/VWc4jINtEwI/AAAAAAAAQWw/MxrzQzakDi4/s1600/slide8b_framed.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BXfYhnDBqA0/VWc4jINtEwI/AAAAAAAAQWw/MxrzQzakDi4/s400/slide8b_framed.png\" width=\"237\" /></a></div>The app can also help you quickly enhance photos and combine them in new ways to help you relive your life\u2019s moments. In one tap, get instant adjustments tuned to the photo\u2019s color, lighting, and subject to make each photo look its best. Press the \u201c+\u201d button to create your own collages, animations, movies with soundtracks, and more.<br />\n<br />\nIf you swipe to the left, you\u2019ll open the Assistant view, where we\u2019ll suggest new things made with your photos and videos, such as a collage or a story based on a recent trip you took.

We wanted to make sharing much simpler and more reliable. <br />\n<br />\nYou can now take any set of photos and videos, or any album, and simply create a link to share hundreds of photos at once. The recipient can see what you shared without a special app or login, then immediately save the high-quality images to their own library with a single tap. So now it\u2019s easier to hang on to the photos you care about even if you weren\u2019t the one holding the camera.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PZ03NpdG5v0/VWc30pbtQbI/AAAAAAAAQV4/MLENvQsrS3c/s1600/Photos-Share-v4.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PZ03NpdG5v0/VWc30pbtQbI/AAAAAAAAQV4/MLENvQsrS3c/s320/Photos-Share-v4.gif\" width=\"180\" /></a></div>If you want to give Google Photos a whirl, it's available now on <a href=\"https://goo.gl/BajWpo\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/toCWvw\">iOS</a> and the <a href=\"https://photos.google.com/\">web</a>. With this launch we've made a lot of progress towards eliminating many of the frustrations involved in storing, editing and sharing your memories. But we have a lot more in store\u2014so as you keep snapping photos and capturing videos, we\u2019ll keep working on making them even easier to store, share and bring to life. <br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydBjsZnHrwM\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Anil Sabharwal, Head of Google Photos</span>", "id": "685244243870111082", "updated": "2015-09-14T18:14:46-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["photos"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/685244243870111082/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-05-28T10:45:00-07:00", "title": "Picture this: A fresh approach to Photos"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/google-impact-challenge-disabilities.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDQxOTI5NTMyMzUwCm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/8503676129998051281", "content": "When Laura Palmaro was 10 years old, she woke one morning to find that the central vision in her left eye had all but disappeared. She was not ill and had no genetic issues\u2014it was completely out of the blue. When she was 14, the same rare condition struck her right eye, and she began her freshman year of high school legally blind. Suddenly she was forced to depend on other people to read everything aloud, from school assignments to menus. The toughest part, according to Laura, was losing her sense of independence\u2014and not knowing when or how she would get it back.<br />\n<br />\nLaura has since adopted technological solutions to her vision challenges, using a combination of screen-readers and magnification software to read, work and more. Now a program manager at Google, she is following her passion, helping Chrome and Chrome OS teams make their products more accessible. \u201cTechnology has truly transformed my life,\u201d she says. \u201cAssistive technology can tear down boundaries, and empower people to find their independence and fulfill their dreams.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWe agree with Laura about the power of technology to change lives. And in order to support more people like her\u2014people who see obstacles as opportunities\u2014we\u2019re launching the <a href=\"http://g.co/ImpactChallengeDisability\">Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities</a>. We\u2019re putting $20 million in Google.org grants behind nonprofits using emerging technologies to increase independence for people living with disabilities, and today we\u2019re issuing an open call to identify new areas of opportunity at <a href=\"http://g.co/ImpactChallengeDisability\">g.co/ImpactChallengeDisability</a>.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re kicking things off with support for two remarkable organizations.

This dramatically cuts costs,  increases  speed of distribution, and meets unmet needs.  We\u2019ll support the Enable Community Foundation's efforts with a $600,000 grant to advance the design, distribution and delivery of open-source 3D-printed upper-limb prosthetics.</li>\n<li>Diagnosing auditory challenges can be a struggle in low income communities\u2014the equipment is expensive, bulky and unrealistic, particularly in the developing world. With our support, and a $500,000 grant, <a href=\"http://www.wwhearing.org/\">World Wide Hearing</a> will develop, prototype and test an extremely low cost tool kit for hearing loss using smartphone technology that\u2019s widely available\u2014and affordable\u2014in the developing world.</li>\n</ul><br />\nThe Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities will seek out nonprofits and help them find new solutions to some serious \u201cwhat ifs\u201d for the disabled community. We will choose the best of these ideas and help them to scale by investing in their vision, by rallying our people and by mobilizing our resources in support of their missions.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4NLr-Dg2FKI/VWP-NP0sAvI/AAAAAAAAQVI/r-nvkUDpiJU/s1600/GIC%2BSocial_one%2Bbillion.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4NLr-Dg2FKI/VWP-NP0sAvI/AAAAAAAAQVI/r-nvkUDpiJU/s640/GIC%2BSocial_one%2Bbillion.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>But of course, we realize there\u2019s always room to improve our products as well. We have a team committed to monitoring the accessibility of Google tools; and we provide engineering teams with training to incorporate accessibility principles into products and services. That doesn\u2019t just mean improving existing Google tools, it means developing new ones as well. For example, Liftware is a stabilizing utensil designed to help people with hand tremors eat more easily, and self-driving cars could one day transform mobility for everyone.<br />\n<br />\nHistorically, people living with disabilities have relied on technologies that were often bulky, expensive, and limited to assisting with one or two specific tasks. But that\u2019s beginning to change. Thanks to groups like Enable and World Wide Hearing, and with tools like Liftware, we\u2019re starting to see the potential for technologies that can profoundly and affordably impact millions. But we\u2019ll all get there sooner if we make it a team effort\u2014which is why we\u2019re launching Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities today. Together, we can create a better world, faster. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Jacquelline Fuller, Director, Google.org</span>", "id": "8503676129998051281", "updated": "2015-09-10T16:58:52-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/8503676129998051281/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-05-26T08:00:00-07:00", "title": "Pursuing transformative technology with the Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/a-doodle-salute-for-sally-ride.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDMyNjE2MTk5OTQ0Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/7928172358650551387", "content": "<i>Today\u2019s guest blog post is from Tam O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2014life partner of astronaut Sally Ride, and co-founder &amp; CEO of <a href=\"http://sallyridescience.com/\">Sally Ride Science</a>. Over the past few months, Tam worked with our Doodle team to create a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/sally-rides-64th-birthday\">doodle for Sally\u2019s 64th birthday</a>. In this post, she tells us more about Sally\u2019s life, her flight aboard the space shuttle </i>Challenger<i>, and her passion for helping kids stay excited about science and technology. </i>-Ed.<br />\n<br />\nAs the first American woman in space, Sally Ride\u2014who would have been 64 today\u2014captured the nation\u2019s imagination as a symbol of the ability of women to break barriers. But her historic flight represented just one aspect of a remarkable and multifaceted life. She was also a physicist, a science writer, and an inspirational advocate for keeping kids excited about science as they go through school.<br />\n<br />\nSally was born on May 26, 1951, in Los Angeles. She grew up playing with a chemistry set and small telescope\u2014and playing football in the streets with the neighborhood kids. Later she considered playing professional tennis, but decided instead to study science. <br />\n<br />\nIn 1977, Sally was finishing her Ph.D. in physics at Stanford University when she saw an article in the student newspaper saying that NASA was looking for astronauts\u2014and for the first time was allowing women to apply. Sally didn\u2019t hesitate to send in her application, and became one of six women selected as part of the new crop of astronaut candidates. On June 18, 1983, she soared into history as the first American woman in space.<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AvfpnyRW8Io\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br /></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>A look behind the scenes of today's Sally Ride doodle, narrated by the artist of the doodle, Olivia Huynh, and Tam O'Shaughnessy</i></div>\n<br />\nLooking back at Earth through the window of the space shuttle, Sally was moved by the view of our beautiful blue planet wrapped in its thin blanket of air. She realized how important it is for all of us to take care of our fragile home in space, and became an environmentalist. Many years later, we wrote books for young adults about Earth\u2019s changing climate.<br />\n<br />\nAfter leaving NASA, Sally became a professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego. She loved being a scientist, but she was concerned that many young people\u2014especially girls and minority students\u2014abandon their early interest in science and math. <br />\n<br />\nStudies show that the reason kids turn away from STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) is not that they don\u2019t like it or aren\u2019t good it. Instead, young people get turned off because society sends false messages about who scientists are, what they do, and how they work. So Sally decided to use her high profile to motivate young people to stick with their interest in science and to consider pursuing STEM careers. <br />\n<br />\nIn 2001, Sally and I and three friends started Sally Ride Science to create programs and publications that bring science to life and show young people that STEM is fascinating, creative, and fun. Since then, we\u2019ve trained thousands of teachers on how to spark and sustain interest in STEM and reached millions of students with our books and programs. <br />\n<br />\nSally died almost three years ago on July 23, 2012, from pancreatic cancer. But I know she would be honored by today\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/sally-rides-64th-birthday\">Google Doodle</a>. With whimsy, it expresses Sally\u2019s sense of fun and adventure, and her ability to inspire young people. And who knows\u2014maybe her Doodle will motivate some girl or boy somewhere in the world to become a scientist and adventurer just like Sally. <br />\n<br />\nSally said it best . . .<br />\n<blockquote>\n<i>Everywhere I go I meet girls and boys who want to be astronauts and explore space, or they love the ocean and want to be oceanographers, or they love animals and want to be zoologists, or they love designing things and want to be engineers. I want to see those same stars in their eyes in 10 years and know they are on their way!</i></blockquote>\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Tam O\u2019Shaughnessy, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Sally Ride Science</span>", "id": "7928172358650551387", "updated": "2015-05-25T21:56:39-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["doodles"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/7928172358650551387/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-05-25T21:56:00-07:00", "title": "A doodle salute for Sally Ride "}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/search-trends-may15-21.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDQxOTI5ODE2NTQxCm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/1192255380065208810", "content": "Between finding out what everyone has always wanted to say to Dave Letterman, and singing along to Taylor\u2019s \u201cBad Blood,\u201d here\u2019s a look at what everyone was searching for this week:<br />\n<br />\n<b>Deadly biker brawl</b><br />\nA shooting between rival motorcycle gangs in Waco, Texas, left nine dead and more than 170 people in jail this week.

We\u2019re looking forward to learning how the community perceives and interacts with the vehicles, and to uncovering challenges that are unique to a fully self-driving vehicle\u2014e.g., where it should stop if it can\u2019t stop at its exact destination due to construction or congestion.

Some issues, like <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/congress-renews-push-to-require-search-warrants-for-email-snooping-20150203\">ECPA reform</a>, are less complex, and we\u2019re encouraged by the broad support in Congress <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/699?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22h.r.+699%22%5D%7D\">for</a> <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/356?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22electronic+communications+privacy+act+amendments+act%22%5D%7D\">legislation</a> that would codify a standard requiring warrants for communications content.<br />\n<br />\nGoogle\u2019s position remains consistent: We respect the important role of the government in investigating and combating security threats, and we comply with valid legal process. At the same time, we\u2019ll fight on behalf of our users against unlawful requests for data or mass surveillance. We also work to make sure surveillance laws are transparent, principled, and reasonable.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Today\u2019s Transparency Report update</b><br />\nWith this in mind, we\u2019re adding some new details to our Transparency Report that we\u2019re releasing today.<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n<li><b>Emergency disclosure requests. </b>We\u2019ve expanded our reporting on requests for information we receive in emergency situations. These emergency disclosure requests come from government agencies seeking information to save the life of a person who is in peril (like a kidnapping victim), or to prevent serious physical injury (like a threatened school shooting). We have a process for evaluating and fast-tracking these requests, and in true emergencies we can provide the necessary data without delay. The Transparency Report previously included this number for the United States, but we\u2019re now reporting for every country that submits this sort of request.</li>\n<li><b>Preservation requests. </b>We\u2019re also now reporting on government requests asking us to set aside information relating to a particular user\u2019s account. These requests can be made so that information needed in an investigation is not lost while the government goes through the steps to get the formal legal process asking us to disclose the information. We call these \"preservation requests\" and because they don't always lead to formal data requests, we keep them separate from the country totals we report. Beginning with this reporting period, we\u2019re reporting this number for every country.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nIn addition to this new data, the report shows that we\u2019ve received 30,138 requests from around the world seeking information about more than 50,585 users/accounts; we provided information in response to 63 percent of those requests. We saw slight increases in the number of requests from governments in Europe (2 percent) and Asia/Pacific (7 percent), and a 22 percent increase in requests from governments in Latin America.<br />\n<br />\n<b>The fight for increased transparency</b><br />\nSometimes, laws and gag-orders prohibit us from notifying someone that a request for their data has been made. There are some situations where these restrictions make sense, and others not so much. We will fight\u2014sometimes through lengthy court action\u2014for our users\u2019 right to know when data requests have been made. We\u2019ve recently succeeded in a couple of important cases.<br />\n<br />\nFirst, after years of persistent litigation in which we fought for the right to inform Wikileaks of government requests for their data, we were successful in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/google-says-it-fought-gag-orders-in-wikileaks-investigation/2015/01/28/e62bfd04-a5c9-11e4-a06b-9df2002b86a0_story.html\">unsealing court documents relating to these requests</a>. We\u2019re now making those documents available to the public <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5dcd1BnwkWGNFZmbjF3MnlqNGc/edit\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5dcd1BnwkWGRzlfQ3ZjS3FNYWc/edit\">here</a>. <br />\n<br />\nSecond, we've fought to be more transparent regarding the U.S. government's use of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter\">National Security Letters</a>, or NSLs. An NSL is a special type of subpoena for user information that the FBI issues without prior judicial oversight. NSLs can include provisions prohibiting the recipient from disclosing any information about it. <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/08/26/open-secret-about-googles-surveillance-case-no-longer-secret/\">Reporters speculated in 2013</a> that we challenged the constitutionality of NSLs; after years of litigation with the government in several courts across multiple jurisdictions, we can now confirm that we challenged 19 NSLs and fought for our right to disclose this to the public. We also recently won the right to release additional information about those challenges and the documents should be available on the public court dockets soon.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, just yesterday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 338-88 to pass the <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.house.gov/index.cfm/usa-freedom-act\">USA Freedom Act of 2015</a>. This represents a significant step toward broader surveillance reform, while preserving important national security authorities.

Since then, the question I get asked most is\u2014so what are you doing about it? <br />\n<br />\nYou may have heard about some of the work we\u2019ve been doing: <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4312d33e1cb8454a9885f230d35f0eb1/google-embeds-engineers-professors\">embedding engineers</a> at Historically Black Colleges and Universities; <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/03/18/google-abc-disney-pair-up-to-promote-images-of-girls-and-computer-science/24903551/\">partnering with Hollywood</a> to inspire girls to pursue careers in computer science; building <a href=\"http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20141003/PC1213/141009834/1003/\">local initiatives</a> to introduce coding to high school students from diverse communities; and expanding our employee unconscious bias <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/you-dont-know-what-you-dont-know-how.html\">training</a>.  <br />\n<br />\nBut these programs represent only a sampling of all the work that is going on behind the scenes. If we\u2019re really going to make an impact, we need a holistic plan. Today, we want to <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/05/05/google-raises-stakes-diversity-spending/26868359/\">share</a> our diversity strategy, which is focused on four key areas: <br />\n<br />\n<b>Hire diverse Googlers: </b>In the past, our university-focused hiring programs have relied heavily on a relatively small number of schools. But, we know those schools aren't always the most diverse. For example, while <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=98\">14% of Hispanic college enrollment is at 4-year schools</a>, Hispanics make up just <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/06/18/new-book-discusses-diversity-strategies-dont-consider-race#sthash.PJ6995ZV.HyygIdnv.dpbs\">7% at the 200 most selective schools</a>. In the past two years, we've doubled the number of schools where we recruit, to promote student diversity. This year, nearly 20 percent of the hires we make from a university are from these new campuses.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Foster a fair and inclusive culture:</b> We want to ensure that we have an environment where all Googlers can thrive. We\u2019ve raised awareness around <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/you-dont-know-what-you-dont-know-how.html\">unconscious bias</a>\u2014half of all Googlers have participated in our unconscious bias workshops\u2014and we\u2019ve now rolled out a hands-on workshop that provides practical tips for addressing bias when we see it. We\u2019re also drawing on the idea of <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/05/googles-20-percent-time-in-action.html\">20 percent</a> time to enable employees to use their time at work to focus on diversity projects. In 2015, more than 500 Googlers will participate in Diversity Core, a formal program in which employees contribute\u2014as part of their job\u2014to the company\u2019s diversity efforts. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Expand the pool of technologists:</b> Making computer science (CS) education accessible and available to everyone is one of our most important initiatives. Our <a href=\"http://www.cs-first.com/\">CS First</a> program is designed to help anyone\u2014a teacher, a coach, or volunteer\u2014teach kids the basics of coding. And since <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/file/d/0B-E2rcvhnlQ_a1Q4VUxWQ2dtTHM/edit\">research</a> tells us that to inspire more girls, we need to show them that computer science isn\u2019t just for boys, we started <a href=\"http://madewithcode.com/\">Made with Code</a>\u2014and we\u2019re working with the entertainment industry to <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/03/18/google-abc-disney-pair-up-to-promote-images-of-girls-and-computer-science/24903551/\">change the perceptions around CS</a> and what it means to be a computer scientist.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Bridge the digital divide:</b> We also want more underrepresented communities, including women and minorities, to share the benefits of the web, and to have access to the economic engine it provides. The <a href=\"http://accelerate.withgoogle.com/\">Accelerate with Google Academy</a> helps business owners get online, grow and drive economic impact. <br />\n<br />\nWith an organization of our size, meaningful change will take time. From one year to the next, bit by bit, our progress will inch forward. More importantly, our industry will become more inclusive, and the opportunities for currently underrepresented groups will grow. We\u2019ll share our updated diversity data for 2015 soon.

One year ago this week, <a href=\"//googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/previewing-new-classroom.html\">we announced Classroom</a>, a tool that helps teachers manage assignments, communicate with students and parents, and stay organized. Since then, we\u2019ve continued to add features that teachers and students tell us they need, and if you stay tuned to the <a href=\"http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/\">Google for Education Blog</a> this week, you\u2019ll hear about a few of our newest additions.  <br />\n<br />\nIn the spirit of listening to our teachers, we\u2019re also continuing to improve our <a href=\"http://www.cs-first.com/\">CS First</a> materials\u2014free online computer science content developed by educators and computer scientists\u2014to help introduce the art of programming to students in grades 4-8 through after-school, in-school and summer programs.<br />\n<br />\nWe also realize the importance of what teachers can learn from one another. So with that in mind, this week we\u2019re hosting <a href=\"https://educationonair.withgoogle.com/live/2015-may?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=2015-EDU-NA-EDU-EDU-AIR-Blogs&amp;utm_content=\">Education on Air</a>\u2014a free online event with 100+ sessions led by educators from 12 countries and 29 U.S. states.

The response, by a 16-year-old girl whose real name was Elizabeth Jane Cochran, argued how important it was for women to be independent and self-reliant. Within a decade, the author of that response would become known worldwide as Nellie Bly: a hard-hitting young journalist who went undercover at a lunatic asylum and traveled around the world in a record-breaking 72 days. <br />\n<br />\nThroughout her life and career, Nellie Bly spoke up for the underprivileged, the helpless and minorities, and defied society\u2019s expectations for women. We love her adventurous spirit, and we share her belief that women can do anything and be anything they want (we like to think if she were around today she\u2019d be a fellow fan of trailblazing women like <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/12/honouring-computings-1843-visionary.html\">Ada</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/anitaborg/\">Anita</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=79&amp;v=yrnNmzSSn0w\">Ann</a>). So when it came time to honor Nellie with a <a href=\"https://g.co/doodle/pd56hz\">Doodle</a>, we wanted to make it special. <a href=\"http://www.karenomusic.com/\">Karen O</a> of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs wrote, composed and recorded an original song about Nellie, and Katy Wu, the artist who created this doodle, created an animation set to Karen O\u2019s music celebrating this intrepid investigative reporter. <br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BrrgeZKvFEo\" width=\"600\"></iframe><br />\n</div>Nellie was born on May 5, 1864 in a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pa. After her response was published in the <i>Dispatch</i> in 1880, the editor, George Madden, tracked her down and hired her as a reporter. At the time, women reporters commonly used pen names; hers came from a song by fellow Pittsburgher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Foster\">Stephen Foster</a>. She spent several years at the paper before moving to New York for a job at New York World, which was owned by Joseph Pulitzer. In 1887, she went undercover at the Women's Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell's Island to write an expos\u00e9 about the conditions there. Her resulting book, \u201cTen Days in a Mad-House,\u201d made her famous. <br />\n<br />\nBut Nellie is best known for her trip around the world. Inspired by Phileas Fogg, the hero of Jules Verne\u2019s novel, \u201cAround the World in 80 Days,\u201d Nellie set sail from New York in November 1889 determined to beat Fogg\u2019s time. Traveling by steamships and sailboats, she sent dispatches back to her newspaper as she circled the globe. Instead of sitting idly and just observing, she was always a part of the action and conversation, despite the fact that public spaces were typically reserved for men at the time.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9YiO4jSqghw/VUgzXa3hktI/AAAAAAAAQJs/NvGWO80D2Zw/s1600/png%3Bbase64acb9b511c3b1ba09.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9YiO4jSqghw/VUgzXa3hktI/AAAAAAAAQJs/NvGWO80D2Zw/s640/png%3Bbase64acb9b511c3b1ba09.png\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Storyboard for today's Nellie Bly video doodle, by Katy Wu</i></div><br />\nWhen creating the Doodle, we took inspiration from Karen O\u2019s lyrics and Nellie\u2019s journey around the globe.

But even in places like the U.S., where mobile connections are nearly ubiquitous, there are still times when you turn to your phone for that split-second answer and don't have fast enough speed. Or you can't get calls and texts because you left your phone in a taxi (or it got lost in a couch cushion for the day). As mobile devices continually improve how you connect to people and information, it's important that wireless connectivity and communication keep pace and be fast everywhere, easy to use, and accessible to everyone. <br />\n<br />\nThat's why today we\u2019re introducing Project Fi, a program to explore this opportunity by introducing new ideas through a fast and easy wireless experience. Similar to our Nexus hardware program, Project Fi enables us to work in close partnership with leading carriers, hardware makers, and all of you to push the boundaries of what's possible. By designing across hardware, software and connectivity, we can more fully explore new ways for people to connect and communicate. Two of the top mobile networks in the U.S.\u2014Sprint and T-Mobile\u2014are partnering with us to launch Project Fi and now you can be part of the project too. <br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xfFHnBQ6nQg\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\nOur three focus areas include: <br />\n<br />\n<b>Helping you get the highest-quality connection</b><br />\nProject Fi aims to put you on the best network wherever you go. As you move around, the best network for you might be a Wi-Fi hotspot or a specific 4G LTE network. We developed new technology that gives you better coverage by intelligently connecting you to the fastest available network at your location whether it's Wi-Fi or one of our two partner LTE networks. As you go about your day, Project Fi automatically connects you to more than a million free, open Wi-Fi hotspots we've verified as fast and reliable. Once you're connected, we help secure your data through encryption. When you're not on Wi-Fi, we move you between whichever of our partner networks is delivering the fastest speed, so you get 4G LTE in more places. <a href=\"http://fi.google.com/about/network/\">Learn more about our network of networks. </a><br />\n<br />\n<b>Enabling easy communication across networks and devices</b><br />\nProject Fi works to get technology out of the way so you can communicate through whichever network type and device you're using. Wherever you're connected to Wi-Fi\u2014whether that's at home, your favorite coffee shop or your Batcave\u2014you can talk and text like you normally do. If you leave an area of Wi-Fi coverage, your call will seamlessly transition from Wi-Fi to cell networks so your conversation doesn\u2019t skip a beat. We also want to help phone numbers adapt to a multi-screen world. With Project Fi, your phone number lives in the cloud, so you can talk and text with your number on just about any phone, tablet or laptop. So the next time you misplace your phone, you can stay connected using another screen. <a href=\"http://fi.google.com/about/experience\">Check out how it works.</a><br />\n<br />\n<b>Making the service experience as simple as possible</b><br />\nProject Fi takes a fresh approach to how you pay for wireless, manage your service, and get in touch when you need help. We offer one simple plan at one price with 24/7 support. Here's how it works: for $20 a month you get all the basics (talk, text, Wi-Fi tethering, and international coverage in 120+ countries), and then it's a flat $10 per GB for cellular data while in the U.S. and abroad. 1GB is $10/month, 2GB is $20/month, 3GB is $30/month, and so on. Since it's hard to predict your data usage, you'll get credit for the full value of your unused data. Let's say you go with 3GB for $30 and only use 1.4GB one month. You'll get $16 back, so you only pay for what you use. <a href=\"http://fi.google.com/about/plan/\">Get all the details about our plan.</a><br />\n<b><br /></b>\n<b>Be part of the project from the start</b><br />\nWe're beginning Project Fi's Early Access Program to invite people to sign up for the service. Project Fi will be available on the Nexus 6, which we developed with Motorola and is the first smartphone that supports the hardware and software to work with our service.

So most Android Wear watches include an always-on screen\u2014no tapping, twisting or shaking required to see what time it is. Now we\u2019re expanding this option to apps, so they can stay visible as long as you need them, instead of disappearing when you drop your arm.

Now Android Wear supports watches with built-in Wi-Fi. As long as your watch is connected to a Wi-Fi network, and your phone has a data connection (wherever it is), you\u2019ll be able to get notifications, send messages, and use all your favorite apps. And if you really do forget your phone, you can always&nbsp;<a href=\"http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2015/03/keep-watch-on-your-phone.html\">ask your watch</a>&nbsp;where it is.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Simpler, faster, and more smiley</b><br />\n<br />\nWhen it comes to your watch, using apps should be as simple as checking the time.

As we said at the time, while many people buy their airline tickets online, finding the right flight at the best price can be a real hassle.  Today Google Flight Search has made that much easier.  Search for \"Flight CDG to SFO\" and you get the different options right there on the results page.  It\u2019s a great example of Google\u2019s increasing ability to answer queries directly, saving people a lot of time and effort\u2014because as Larry Page said over a decade ago \u201cthe perfect search engine should understand exactly what you mean and give you back exactly what you want.\"<br />\n<br />\nAt the time of the ITA acquisition, several online travel companies\u2014Expedia, Kayak, and Travelocity--unsuccessfully lobbied regulators in the US and the European Union to block the deal, arguing that our ability to show flight options directly would siphon off their traffic and harm competition online.  Four years later it\u2019s clear their allegations of harm turned out to be untrue.  As the <i><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/google-flight-search-four-years-in-success-or-not/2014/10/02/bfb69036-45ab-11e4-9a15-137aa0153527_story.html\">Washington Post</a> </i>recently pointed out (in an article headed \u201cGoogle Flight Search, four years in:  not the competition-killer critics feared\u201d) Expedia, Orbitz, Priceline and Travelocity account for 95% of the US online travel market today.  It\u2019s a similar situation in Europe too, as this graph for Germany neatly shows:<br />\n<br />\n<b>Travel sites in Germany</b><br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j2NSQNkMoww/VS6Du6_AKPI/AAAAAAAAQCE/mHPzyDfMAUA/s1600/travel%2Bsites%2Bin%2Bgermany.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j2NSQNkMoww/VS6Du6_AKPI/AAAAAAAAQCE/mHPzyDfMAUA/s1600/travel%2Bsites%2Bin%2Bgermany.png\" height=\"436\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><i>Source: ComScore MMX and Google data (for Google), desktop traffic, unique visitors (\u2018000s)</i><span id=\"goog_1386856001\"></span><br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve seen similar <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/10/us-eu-google-antitrust-insight-idUSKBN0N022E20150410\">allegations</a> of harm from competitors in other areas.  And the European Commission today confirmed that it is sending Google a Statement of Objections (SO) regarding the display and ranking of shopping results.   <br />\n<br />\nWhile Google may be the most used search engine, people can now find and access information in numerous different ways\u2014and allegations of harm, for consumers <u>and</u> competitors, have proved to be wide of the mark.   <br />\n<br />\n<b>More choice than ever before</b><br />\nIn fact, people have more choice than ever before.<br />\n<br />\n<ul><li>There are numerous other search engines such as Bing, Yahoo, Quora, DuckDuckGo and a new wave of search assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana.</li>\n<li>In addition, there are a ton of specialized services like Amazon, Idealo, Le Guide, Expedia or eBay.  For example, Amazon, eBay, and Axel Springer\u2019s Idealo are the three most popular shopping services in Germany.</li>\n<li>People are increasingly using social sites like Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter to find recommendations, such as where to eat, which movies to watch or how to decorate their homes.</li>\n<li>When it comes to news, users have many ways to reach their favorite sites. For example, <i>Bild</i> gets more than 85% of its traffic from sources other than Google and other search engines.*</li>\n</ul><br />\nOf course mobile is changing things as well.  Today <a href=\"http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2014/The-US-Mobile-App-Report\">7 out of every 8 minutes</a> on mobile devices is spent within apps\u2014in other words consumers are going to whichever websites or apps serve them best.  And they face no friction or costs in switching between them.  Yelp, for example, has told investors they get over 40% of their searches direct from their mobile apps.* So while in many ways it\u2019s flattering to be described as a gatekeeper, the facts don\u2019t actually bear that out.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Thriving competition online</b><br />\nWhich brings me to the competition.  Companies like Axel Springer, Expedia, TripAdvisor, and Yelp (all vociferous complainants in this process) have alleged that Google\u2019s practice of including our specialized results (Flight Search, Maps, Local results, etc.) in search has significantly harmed their businesses.  But their traffic, revenues and profits (as well as the pitch they make to investors) tell a very different story.<br />\n<br />\n<ul><li>Yelp calls itself the \u201cde facto local search engine\u201d and has seen revenue growth of over 350% in the last four years.</li>\n<li>TripAdvisor claims to be the Web\u2019s largest travel brand and has nearly doubled its revenues in the last four years.</li>\n<li>Expedia has grown its revenues by more than 67% over the same period\u2014and recently told investors:  <i>\u201cWe're seeing increased traffic coming through Google Hotel Finder.  It is \u00adclearly getting more exposure. And in general \u2026 the product continues to improve.  And Google has invested in it, we'll continue to invest in it \u2026 From our standpoint, we're happy to play in any market that Google puts out there and over a long period of time, we have proven an ability to get our fair share in the Google marketplaces.\u201d </i>(Remarkable given their complaints.)</li>\n<li>Axel Springer continues to invest in search, including the French search engine Qwant, because as the company told investors, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.axelspringer.de/en/presse/Axel-Springer-Digital-Ventures-is-participating-in-French-startup-Qwant.com_21308881.html\">there is a lot of innovation on the search market</a>.\u201d</li>\n</ul><br />\nIndeed if you look at shopping\u2014an area where we have seen a lot of complaints and where the European Commission has focused in its Statement of Objections\u2014it\u2019s clear that (a) there\u2019s a ton of competition (including from Amazon and eBay, two of the biggest shopping sites in the world) and (b) Google\u2019s shopping results have not harmed the competition.

People used feature phones, which had very basic functionality, and were a nightmare for developers.

We hoped that by offering a great, free open-source operating system, we could turbocharge innovation by allowing manufacturers and developers to focus on what they do best.  At the time, most people thought this plan was nuts.<br />\n<br />\nFast forward to today.  The pace of mobile innovation has never been greater.  Smartphones are being adopted globally at an increasingly fast pace, with over hundreds of millions shipped each quarter, and the average smartphone price fell 23% between <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24461213\">2012</a> and <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25282214\">2014</a>.  It\u2019s now possible to purchase a powerful smartphone, without subsidies or contracts, for under $100.  And the app ecosystem has exploded, giving consumers more choice than ever before.<br />\n<br />\nAndroid has been a key player in spurring this competition and choice, lowering prices and increasing choice for everyone (there are over <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/devs-now-have-over-18000-different-android-devices-to-tweak-apps-for/\">18,000</a> different devices available today);<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n<li>It\u2019s an open-source operating system that can be used <a href=\"https://source.android.com/\">free-of-charge</a> by anyone\u2014that\u2019s right, literally anyone.  And it\u2019s not just phones.  Today people are building almost anything with Android\u2014including tablets, watches, TVs, cars, and more.  Some Android devices use Google services, and <a href=\"https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/platforms/android-fireos\">others</a> do not.</li>\n<li>Our Google Play store contains over one million apps and we paid out over $7 billion in revenue over the past year to developers and content publishers.</li>\n<li>Apps that compete directly with Google such as Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft Office, and Expedia are easily available to Android users.  Indeed many of these apps come pre-loaded onto Android devices in addition to Google apps. The recent Samsung S6 is a great example of this, including pre-installed apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Google.</li>\n<li>Developers have a choice of platforms and <a href=\"http://www.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/q4-2013-devsurvey.pdf\">over 80% of developers</a> are building apps for several different mobile operating systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nThe European Commission has asked questions about our partner agreements.  It's important to remember that these are voluntary\u2014again, you can use Android without Google\u2014but provide real benefits to Android users, developers and the broader ecosystem.<br />\n<br />\nAnti-fragmentation agreements, for example, ensure apps work across all sorts of different Android devices. (After all, it would be pretty frustrating if an app you downloaded on one phone didn\u2019t also work on your eventual replacement phone.)  And our app distribution agreements make sure that people get a great \"out of the box\" experience with useful apps right there on the home screen (how many of us could get through our day without maps or email?).  This also helps manufacturers of Android devices compete with Apple, Microsoft and other mobile ecosystems that come preloaded with similar baseline apps.  And remember that these distribution agreements are not exclusive, and Android manufacturers install their own apps and apps from other companies as well.  And in comparison to Apple\u2014the world\u2019s most profitable (mobile) phone company\u2014there are far fewer Google apps pre-installed on Android phones than Apple apps on iOS devices.<br />\n<br />\nWe are thankful for Android\u2019s success and we understand that with success comes scrutiny.  But it's not just Google that has benefited from Android's success.  The Android model has let manufacturers compete on their unique innovations.  Developers can reach huge audiences and build strong businesses.  And consumers now have unprecedented choice at ever-lower prices.  We look forward to discussing these issues in more detail with the European Commission over the months ahead. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Hiroshi Lockheimer, VP of Engineering, Android</span>", "id": "3925028378842550156", "updated": "2015-04-15T08:24:28-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/3925028378842550156/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-04-15T03:22:00-07:00", "title": "Android has helped create more choice and innovation on mobile than ever before"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/04/opening-doors-to-world-famous-abbey.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDQyMjc5MzMzNTQwCm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/8657461697474663755", "content": "On a leafy street in north London, next to a <a href=\"http://www.abbeyroad.com/crossing\">popular zebra crossing</a>, is one of the world\u2019s most celebrated music landmarks: Abbey Road Studios.<br />\n<br />\nMost people probably associate Abbey Road with the Beatles album of the same name. In fact, the studios have played a role in music history: if you can hum the theme to \"Star Wars,\" \"Harry Potter\" or \"Indiana Jones,\" or you\u2019ve sung along to tracks by Pink Floyd or Oasis, or even if you own a pair of stereo headphones, then you\u2019ve been impacted by the work of Abbey Road. Since opening in 1931, the studios have pushed the boundaries of music and sound, reinventing the recording process at every step. But until now, the famous crossing was as close as most of us could get to the studios.<br />\n<br />\nNow, for the first time, the doors at Abbey Road are open to everyone. In partnership with Abbey Road Studios, we\u2019ve created <a href=\"http://g.co/insideabbeyroad\">Inside Abbey Road</a>, an experience that lets fans around the world step inside the studios and explore this renowned institution.<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGztmJrf748\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\nAccessible via desktop, tablet and phone, you can explore every nook and cranny of Abbey Road with more than 150 different 360-degree panoramic images. As you walk through the studios, you\u2019ll see YouTube videos and archival images from Abbey Road\u2019s history\u2014right where they originally happened. You can also play with pioneering equipment in specially designed interactive gadgets, such as the J37 4-track recorder that was used to record the Beatles\u2019 <i>Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band.</i><br />\n<br />\nThroughout the studios you\u2019ll find more than 30 stories, full of anecdotes and facts about the studios, like the story of Abbey Road engineer Alan Blumlein. Alan was annoyed after a trip to the movies, because the sound in early cinemas only came from one side of the screen. He went on to invent the concept of stereo audio\u2014and sound and screen have matched ever since. Or, if you feel like being guided around the studios, there's an audio tour you can join in every studio. Narrated by producer Giles Martin, engineer and Head of Audio Products Mirek Stiles, and broadcaster Lauren Laverne, the audio tours let you see the studios through their eyes. Think of it as your own personal tour.<br />\n<br />\nInside Abbey Road is part of our broader effort to help people experience worldwide culture and places from wherever they are, whether it\u2019s visiting the Pyramids of Giza in Google Maps or getting up close to the brush strokes of Van Gogh in the Google Art Project. Now, we\u2019re taking you behind the doors of one of the most famous music studios in the world.

Here\u2019s a look at what people were searching for this week: <br />\n<br />\n<b>Germanwings Flight 9525</b><br />\nOn Tuesday, Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed in the French Alps, killing all 150 people who were onboard. In the wake of the tragedy, people around the world have turned to search to learn more about the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Germanwings&amp;std=20150324&amp;pn=p1#a=20150324-Germanwings\">crash</a> and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Germanwings&amp;std=20150326&amp;pn=p1#a=20150326-Germanwings\">subsequent investigation</a>. Early searches included questions about Lufthansa, Germanwings\u2019 parent company, and about the type of plane that had crashed; search interest in the Airbus A320 family spiked 100x in the first four hours. But after investigations revealed that co-pilot <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Andreas+Lubitz&amp;std=20150326&amp;pn=p1#a=20150326-Andreas+Lubitz\">Andreas Lubitz</a> appears to have deliberately locked himself in the cockpit and flown the plane into a mountain, the questions got more specific. People asked questions like \u201cHow do you access the plane\u2019s cockpit?\u201d and worried: \u201cIs it safe to fly after the Germanwings crash?\u201d and \u201cIs flying becoming more dangerous?\u201d <br />\n<br />\n<b>Presidential politics</b><br />\nElection Day 2016 is more than a year-and-a-half away, but the presidential race is already underway. On Monday, Senator Ted Cruz announced his candidacy. The Texas Republican is known for his fervent opposition to the Affordable Care Act, in particular a 21-hour filibuster-style speech on the floor of the Senate in 2013 (at one point, he read aloud from Dr. Seuss\u2019 <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i>). Searchers turned to the web to answer all kinds of questions about Cruz and his beliefs, sending searches for [cruz liberty], [cruz obamacare] and [cruz wiki] to spike <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=ted%20cruz&amp;date=today%201-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=\">more than a thousand percent</a> in the last 30 days. The top questions, though, were around whether Cruz is eligible to become President because he was born in Canada. (The answer is yes, BTW.)<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uQleYPEOlU8/VRXcWGkxg5I/AAAAAAAAP_g/iium050vXXs/s1600/TedCruz_Qs.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uQleYPEOlU8/VRXcWGkxg5I/AAAAAAAAP_g/iium050vXXs/s1600/TedCruz_Qs.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a></div><b>Pop culture mania</b><br />\nThis week Zayn Malik confirmed he is leaving boy band One Direction, sending <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelzarrell/teens-mourn-zayn#.wnx7eGyMr\">teens</a> worldwide into a <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/elliewoodward/zayn-malik-has-left-one-direction-and-the-internets-lost-its#.oc42W1rQ3\">tailspin</a> as they asked (and searched): \u201cWhy is Zayn leaving One Direction?\u201d The British star said that he is leaving to \u201cbe a normal 22-year-old...out of the spotlight,\u201d which may be tough given there were more than <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Zayn+Malik&amp;std=20150325&amp;pn=p1#a=20150325-Zayn+Malik\">a million searches for him</a> on Wednesday.

Marieshia runs <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115560580538070249843/posts\">Dependable Care Health Service</a> in Garland, and it was her business that was missing. But that all changed last month when she attended a workshop at the Garland Chamber of Commerce called Let\u2019s Put Garland on the Map.<br />\n<br />\nThe workshop, run by our Get Your Business Online team, showed her how to use Google My Business\u2014a tool that allows business owners to control the info listed about their business on Google Search and Maps\u2014to help more people find Dependable. Marieshia added an updated phone number, hours of operation, and a description to her business listing. Within a few months, she had more customers come through the door and referrals from doctors who could reach her. This one simple adjustment made a difference. In Marieshia\u2019s words: \u201cIt\u2019s huge.\u201d <br />\n<br />\nHuge might be an understatement. <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/research-studies/how-advertisers-can-extend-their-relevance-with-search.html\">Four out of five people</a> use search engines to find local information, like business hours and addresses, and research shows that businesses with complete listings are t<a href=\"https://www.gybo.com/downloads/verification-benefits.pdf\">wice as likely</a>&nbsp;(PDF) to be considered reputable by customers. Consumers are <a href=\"http://www.gybo.com/search-listing-research\">38 percent more likely to visit and 29 percent more likely to consider purchasing</a> from businesses with complete listings. Yet <a href=\"http://www.meclabs.com/training/misc/EXCERPT-PLAIN-BMR-2012-Search-Marketing-SEO-Edition.pdf\">only 37 percent of businesses</a>&nbsp;(PDF) have claimed a local business listing on a search engine. That\u2019s a lot of missed opportunities for small businesses. <br />\n<br />\nWith this in mind, our Get Your Business Online team set out in 2011 to help businesses like Marieshia\u2019s get found online. We\u2019ve gone to every state in the U.S. and worked with thousands of business owners to create free websites and update their Google Search and Maps listings. But there\u2019s a lot more work to do to help businesses take advantage of the vast opportunities yielded by the web. So today, we\u2019re introducing <a href=\"http://www.gybo.com/\">Let\u2019s Put Our Cities on the Map</a>, a new program to help 30,000 cities get their local businesses online.<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1OFk9EpegUs\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\nIf we want to help every business in the U.S., we need to reach businesses where they are. So this tailor-made program provides each city with a custom website where local businesses can find helpful resources, including a new diagnostic tool that shows businesses how they appear on Search and Maps, a step-by-step guide for getting online with Google My Business, and a free website and domain name for one year with our partner, Startlogic.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re also forming partnerships with local organizations\u2014like chambers and small business development centers\u2014and equipping them with free trainings and customized city materials to run workshops just like the one Marieshia attended in Garland. These local partners know the challenges for local businesses more than anyone\u2014and they recognize the value of getting businesses online. After all, getting Dependable\u2019s information online not only means the world for Marieshia, it means even more for the city of Garland. Complete business info can help generate economic value <a href=\"https://www.gybo.com/downloads/verification-benefits.pdf\">up to $300,000 a year for a small city or up to $7 million for a large one</a>&nbsp;(PDF). So when our local businesses are online, our local economies benefit.<br />\n<br />\nIf you have a favorite local business\u2014a day care, a dentist, a dry cleaner\u2014show your support by helping them get their info online and on the map.

The dangerous sites detected by Safe Browsing generally fall into two categories: sites that attack users <i>intentionally</i> with either <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware\">malware</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing\">phishing</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/company/unwanted-software-policy.html\">unwanted software</a> that is deceptive or hard to uninstall, or sites that attack users <i>unintentionally</i> because they have been compromised, often without the site\u2019s owner realizing this has happened.<br />\n<br />\nOnce we detect these sites, Safe Browsing warns people about them in a variety of ways.  You\u2019ve probably come across a warning like this in Chrome, Firefox or Safari; it\u2019s powered by Safe Browsing:<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l0vRG2VpYYI/VQGwHLFzbDI/AAAAAAAAP7E/H0mdBnKzjrU/s1600/png%3Bbase6454b054f31de5fa53.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l0vRG2VpYYI/VQGwHLFzbDI/AAAAAAAAP7E/H0mdBnKzjrU/s1600/png%3Bbase6454b054f31de5fa53.png\" height=\"283\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>Today, Safe Browsing shows people more than 5 million warnings per day for all sorts of malicious sites and unwanted software, and discovers more than 50,000 malware sites and more than 90,000 phishing sites every month. If you\u2019re interested, you can see information about the dangerous sites that are detected by this technology anytime in our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/safebrowsing/\">Safe Browsing Transparency Report</a>.<br />\n<br />\nWe also use Safe Browsing technology to warn website owners or operators about issues with their sites so they can quickly fix them. We provide basic site maintenance tips, as well as specific Safe Browsing notifications in Webmaster Tools and Google Analytics. Often site owners don\u2019t realize there are issues with their sites until they get these notifications.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Recent developments</b><br />\nSince its earliest days, Safe Browsing has been widely available, and free\u2014for users, site owners, and other companies\u2014to use and integrate into their own products.  In the early days, we focused on detecting dangerous sites and then showing people warnings:<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lLUskTDmlgo/VQGwEA-oOQI/AAAAAAAAP68/acc7jPKcD1w/s1600/old%2Bsafe%2Bbrowsing%2Bwarning.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lLUskTDmlgo/VQGwEA-oOQI/AAAAAAAAP68/acc7jPKcD1w/s1600/old%2Bsafe%2Bbrowsing%2Bwarning.png\" height=\"278\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>An early Safe Browsing notification, c. 2007.

Over the years, we\u2019ve built Safe Browsing into other Google products to help protect people in more places:<br />\n<br />\n<ul><li><b>Safe Browsing API:</b> We already make Safe Browsing data available for free to developers. This week we\u2019re adding information about sites that host unwanted software, allowing developers to better protect their users as well.</li>\n<li><b>Chrome: </b>Before people <a href=\"http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/02/more-protection-from-unwanted-software.html\">visit</a> a site delivering <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/company/unwanted-software-policy.html\">unwanted software</a>, or try to <a href=\"http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/08/thats-not-download-youre-looking-for.html\">download</a> some of it, we show them a clear warning.</li>\n<li><b>Google Analytics:</b> We recently <a href=\"http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/02/safe-browsing-and-google-analytics.html\">integrated</a> Safe Browsing notifications into Google Analytics, so site owners can quickly take action to protect their users if there are issues with their websites. Previously, we\u2019d only provided these warnings via our Webmaster Tools service.</li>\n<li><b>Ads:</b> We\u2019ve also <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/6101154?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=29265\">recently</a> begun to identify ads that target people with unwanted software.</li>\n</ul><br />\nAs the web grows up, Safe Browsing technology will, too. We\u2019re looking forward to protecting the web, and its users, for many birthdays to come.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Panayiotis Mavrommatis, Safe Browsing Team</span>", "id": "7234264769351378654", "updated": "2015-09-15T08:24:44-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["security"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/7234264769351378654/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-03-12T09:00:00-07:00", "title": "Protecting people across the web with Google Safe Browsing"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/03/meet-updated-chromebook-pixel-and-new.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDQyMzMwNzI3NTYzCm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/7453620141376204977", "content": "Two years ago, we <a href=\"http://chrome.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-chromebook-pixel-for-whats-next.html\">introduced</a> the first Chromebook Pixel. The idea was to bring together the best in hardware, software and design to inspire the next generation of Chromebooks. It's been exciting to see how the entire range of Chromebooks\u2014from classroom-proof to high-end\u2014has made a difference to people <a href=\"http://www.futuresource-consulting.com/2014-12-record-quarter-for-chromebooks-press-3428.html\">at school</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/2863936/amazons-three-top-selling-computers-for-the-holidays-were-chromebooks.html\">at home</a>, and <a href=\"http://googleforwork.blogspot.com/2014/10/chromebooks-for-work-more-manageable.html\">at work</a>. Today, we\u2019re introducing <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chromebook/pixel\">an updated and more powerful Pixel</a> to fuel the imaginations of another wave of Chromebook enthusiasts. Plus, we\u2019ve created a new, online <a href=\"https://store.google.com/?utm_source=blogpost&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=launch\">Google Store</a> where you can get the Pixel and other devices made with Google, all in one place.  <br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jC8Xy3Q82hY\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\n<b>One charger for all your stuff</b><br />\nThese days, packing for a trip means remembering to bring all your different chargers\u2014for your phone, laptop, tablet, watch, etc. We think you should be able to use just one charger for all your electronics. So for the new Pixel, we\u2019ve joined forces with some of the biggest names in the industry to create a new standard for charging, called <a href=\"http://www.usb.org/press/USB-IF_Press_Releases/Type-C_PR_20131203_Final.pdf\">USB Type C</a>. The Pixel is one of the first products to launch with this new standard, with more Chromebooks and Android devices following suit soon.<br />\n<br />\nNot only does Type-C enable multi-device charging, but it also allows high-speed data and display over the same connector and cable. It\u2019s small enough to work with smartphones, powerful enough to charge computers, and conveniently symmetrical (no more guessing which side is up!). Speaking of symmetry, the new Pixel doesn\u2019t just have one Type C port\u2014it has two, one on each side, so you can plug in wherever is convenient. <br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-J0FWWDuRg\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\n<b>Thoughtful design</b><br />\nLike the original Pixel, the new Chromebook has a high-resolution touchscreen, a sleek aluminum body, and smooth glass trackpad. We\u2019ve also made a few other enhancements, including a new wide-angle camera lens. <br />\n<br />\nOf course, the Pixel is also great on the inside. It\u2019s got a powerful Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i5 with 8GB RAM and a 32GB SSD. If that\u2019s not enough for you, we\u2019re making an LS (yup, that stands for \"Ludicrous Speed\") version that's even faster. And even with the new charger, you probably won\u2019t be carrying it around much, since the new Pixel has 12 hours of battery life.* When you do need to top up, it\u2019s fast\u2014you\u2019ll get up to two hours of battery life with just 15 minutes of charging.*<br />\n<br />\n<b>Shop for the Pixel and more at the Google Store </b><br />\nWe\u2019ve been selling our devices on Google Play for years, but as we\u2019ve added more products to the family, we thought it was time to make it easier for you to learn more about them. So today we\u2019re also launching the Google Store, the new home for the latest devices made with Google.<br />\n<br />\nAt <a href=\"https://store.google.com/?utm_source=blogpost&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=launch\">store.google.com</a>, you can shop Nexus phones and tablets, Chromecast and Chromebooks, learn more about newer technology like Android Wear, Nexus Player and Nest, and stock up on accessories like cases, keyboards and chargers. You\u2019ll see how the Google apps you already know\u2014like Search, Maps and YouTube\u2014work seamlessly with all these products. The Google Store is available on your phone, tablet, or laptop, and right now you\u2019ll get free shipping on everything** (consider it our way of saying hello).<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zBLSBIhUZSY/VQCV-H3hHKI/AAAAAAAAP6c/BA8xUL7idng/s1600/gTL2OJ3gkb.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zBLSBIhUZSY/VQCV-H3hHKI/AAAAAAAAP6c/BA8xUL7idng/s1600/gTL2OJ3gkb.png\" height=\"326\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>Once you\u2019ve found the right device at the Google Store, you can still head to Google Play to find apps, games, music, movies, TV shows and more.

Nope\u2014according to Liz, her greatest achievement is co-founding <a href=\"https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/minneapolis\">Girl Develop It Minneapolis</a>, a chapter in the national non-profit <a href=\"https://www.girldevelopit.com/about\">Girl Develop It</a>, which provides hands-on programs and a network of support to women interested in learning web and software development.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WCytHBdjorQ/VPvF_EBuffI/AAAAAAAAP5k/U4kV7AzXV6U/s1600/For%2BOGB%2B-%2BRobot%2B3D%2BImaging.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WCytHBdjorQ/VPvF_EBuffI/AAAAAAAAP5k/U4kV7AzXV6U/s1600/For%2BOGB%2B-%2BRobot%2B3D%2BImaging.png\" height=\"177\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>3D imaging from the industrial robot, designed and built by Liz and her team</i></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jdU5qxmQe0\">\u201cSeegrid Vision Guided Vehicle: Pallet Truck\u201d</a></i></div><br />\nLiz often remembers being the only woman engineer on her team, but it wasn\u2019t until she moved to a new city and spent more time working remotely that she began to feel isolated\u2014and realized how important it was for her to have a community of like-minded people to connect with. She started volunteering with a few local organizations and started the local Girl Develop It chapter in 2014. In just seven months, her chapter has more than 500 members and Liz has found a network of people she can connect to.<br />\n<br />\nThere are many women like Liz who never find that sense of community and instead end up leaving tech permanently. Not only does that mean our industry is less diverse than it should be, but it also leads to less innovative products. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for Google to do our part in creating environments, programs and policies that help women in technology thrive. We\u2019ve partnered with organizations like <a href=\"https://www.girldevelopit.com/\">Girl Develop It</a>, <a href=\"https://www.womenwhocode.com/\">Women Who Code</a>, <a href=\"http://anitaborg.org/\">Anita Borg Institute</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ncwit.org/\">National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology</a> to create a more supportive environment for women in tech. And this International Women\u2019s Day, we\u2019re building on our efforts to empower women to become makers of technology. Here\u2019s a look at what we\u2019re up to:<br />\n<br />\n<b>Women Techmakers</b><br />\nLast year, Google started our Women Techmakers program to provide visibility, resources and a community for women in technology worldwide. This month we kicked off our second annual <a href=\"http://womentechmakers.com/\">Women Techmakers Global Event Series</a>, and we encourage you to attend an event to meet incredible women from around the world who are leading the technology industry. Create the future of wearables at a summit or from home with a brand new <a href=\"http://g.co/dev/codelab-watchface\">Android Wear Watch Face Codelab</a>, and engage with the community using our hashtag #WTM15.

As part of our International Women\u2019s Day celebration, we\u2019re encouraging you to think back on the advice you wish you\u2019d gotten when you were a young, and to share those words of wisdom with today\u2019s teenage girls.

So we\u2019re adding lots of bike paths and retail opportunities, like restaurants, for local businesses.

Enter <a href=\"https://www.google.com/flights/\">Google Flights</a>, which makes it easy to plan the trip that\u2019s right for you. Here are a few tips to help you book this year\u2019s dream vacation.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Flexibility is key when finding great deals</b><br />\nThere\u2019s a travel myth that you can always find the best deals on Tuesday. But actually, you can find good deals any day of the week\u2014especially if you\u2019re flexible with your travel dates. Though it\u2019s sometimes hard to pull the trigger because you\u2019re afraid the price will drop tomorrow (or next Tuesday, maybe?), our experience shows it\u2019s usually best to book right away. <br />\n<br />\nRegardless of which day you sit down to plan your trip, you can use the <a href=\"http://googletravel.blogspot.com/2014/02/calendar-shopping-for-flights-just-got.html\">calendar</a> in Google Flights to scroll through months and see the lowest fare highlighted for each day. If you\u2019re planning even further out, use the lowest fares graph beneath the calendar to see how prices may fluctuate based on the season, holidays or other events. You can also set preferences (such as direct flights only) and our calendar will adjust to show you just those flights and fares that fit the bill. Finally, if you can save more by using a nearby airport or flying on a different day, we\u2019ll show you a tip at the top of your results. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sr1bbItkmp4/VO0xUOob9jI/AAAAAAAAP0U/JAe0IBCBTT0/s1600/OGB%2BFlights%2BPress%2BBreakfast%2Bcal%2Blow%2Bfare%2Bgraph%2Bimage.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sr1bbItkmp4/VO0xUOob9jI/AAAAAAAAP0U/JAe0IBCBTT0/s1600/OGB%2BFlights%2BPress%2BBreakfast%2Bcal%2Blow%2Bfare%2Bgraph%2Bimage.png\" height=\"381\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><b>Not sure about your destination?

All our <a href=\"http://goo.gl/QDA6gK\">CS First materials</a> are free and available online, and the curriculum is designed for everyone to work at their own pace, meaning it\u2019s accessible even to people who are new to technology. It\u2019s also designed to tap into students\u2019 existing interests, showing them how CS can integrate with the rest of their lives. Inspired by fashion, art, music, politics and more, students have used code to build videos, games and stories on topics big and small, from how they met their best friends to solving global hunger.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wXgUCKRpT5A/VOtbCZiYCPI/AAAAAAAAPzw/S5WdxDLJTFU/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-02-13%2Bat%2B2.45.47%2BPM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wXgUCKRpT5A/VOtbCZiYCPI/AAAAAAAAPzw/S5WdxDLJTFU/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-02-13%2Bat%2B2.45.47%2BPM.png\" height=\"416\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>CS First participants at Sedgefield Middle School in Goose Creek, SC look over a friend\u2019s shoulder at her project</i></div><br />\nNow, we\u2019re partnering with <a href=\"http://goo.gl/j9Bk66\">Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America</a> and <a href=\"http://goo.gl/8cioDK\">Corporation for National and Community Service</a> to bring CS First to even more students across the country. A new group of 20 AmeriCorps VISTA members will spend a year helping local Boys &amp; Girls Clubs incorporate CS First and other educational programs into their slate of activities, giving more young people, especially those who might not otherwise be exposed to coding, greater access to computer science education. <br />\n<br />\nComputer science is increasingly important to building a successful career, in fields varying from medicine to architecture to music. But today, there aren\u2019t enough computer scientists to fill the available jobs\u2014and on top of that, many populations aren\u2019t equally represented in the field. According to code.org, only 8 percent of people who take the Advanced Placement Computer Science Exam are students of color, and only 15 percent are women. And while women earn 57 percent of all bachelor's degrees, only 12 percent of computer science degrees are awarded to women. We want to expand the pool of technologists, and make sure that all young people, regardless of background or resources, have access to high-quality CS education from an early age. <br />\n<br />\nThat\u2019s what this new effort is all about. Our partners have long been committed to supporting young people and communities. <a href=\"http://goo.gl/j9Bk66\">Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America</a> gives young people access to opportunities to help them become productive and responsible citizens during out of school time. And <a href=\"http://goo.gl/TwY1xk\">AmeriCorps VISTA</a> taps the skills and passion of more than 7,000 Americans annually to support community efforts to overcome poverty. Working together, we can empower more young people with the technical know-how they need to succeed in today\u2019s society and economy. <br />\n<br />\nJoin us in making CS more accessible to more kids, and <a href=\"http://goo.gl/pBj84s\">apply on the AmeriCorps website</a> by March 1. If accepted, you\u2019ll come to the Google headquarters in Mountain View for training before spending a year in one of six cities. Best of all, your year of service will make a real difference in the lives of young people. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Kate Berrio, Google CS First Program Manager</span>", "id": "4097687862878219090", "updated": "2015-09-15T08:18:48-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["education"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/4097687862878219090/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-02-23T09:00:00-08:00", "title": "Expanding opportunities through computer science education"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/02/youtube-kids.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDI0NzA4OTA4MjUxCm9mZnNldDogLTI4ODAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/5716586263333528327", "content": "When we were kids, if we wanted to learn more about gorillas or how to make friendship bracelets, our parents pointed us to an encyclopedia, or took us to the library.

And today, we\u2019re launching YouTube Kids, a new family-friendly app that makes it easy for kids to explore a vast selection of videos on any topic. <br />\n<br />\nIn the new YouTube Kids app, available on Android and iOS in the U.S., videos are narrowed to focus on content that is appropriate for the whole family. You might explore DIY arts and crafts, learn how to find the circumference of a circle, or watch favorites from Mother Goose Club to Minecraft, as well as new series from National Geographic Kids and Reading Rainbow. And there are more train videos than even you can count. <br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve designed the app to be easier for kids to use, with a brighter and bigger interface that\u2019s perfect for small thumbs and pudgy fingers.

For example, making use of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/green/efficiency/datacenters/\">natural climates</a> has helped us make our data centers 50% more efficient than the industry average, and green building technology has helped us limit energy consumption in our offices around the world. Now, we\u2019re doing more with less to power Google\u2019s North Bayshore campus in Mountain View.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve recently signed a long-term agreement to purchase enough local wind energy to offset the electrical consumption of our North Bayshore headquarters on an annual basis. While we\u2019ve been committed to being a carbon-neutral company <a href=\"//googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/06/carbon-neutrality-by-end-of-2007.html\">since 2007</a>, and we purchase clean energy for our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/green/energy/use/#purchasing\">data centers</a>, this agreement is the first of its kind when it comes to our offices.<br />\n<br />\nThe agreement with <a href=\"http://www.nexteraenergyresources.com/home/index.shtml\">NextEra Energy Resources</a> will help to repower an iconic Bay Area wind farm at California\u2019s Altamont Pass with new turbines that will pour 43 MW of electricity onto the grid starting in 2016. This new technology is twice as efficient, and also safer\u2014especially for <a href=\"http://energyblog.nationalgeographic.com/2013/02/01/notorious-altamont-wind-area-becomes-safer-for-birds/\">wildlife</a>.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HbaYMi9Yu1Q/VNtogdv36LI/AAAAAAAAPw4/JPeh4Qi6b6s/s1600/20150206-Golden%2BHills-007.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HbaYMi9Yu1Q/VNtogdv36LI/AAAAAAAAPw4/JPeh4Qi6b6s/s1600/20150206-Golden%2BHills-007.jpg\" height=\"184\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>The new turbines will generate energy that feeds into the grid that powers our North Bayshore buildings in Mountain View. While these electrons can\u2019t be traced once they enter the grid, we can measure how many of them leave the turbines, as well as how many we use on campus on an annual basis (tracked through a system of <a href=\"http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/us/green/pdfs/renewable-energy.pdf\">renewable energy credits</a>, or RECs). So even though the electrons follow an untraceable path through the California electricity grid, we can be sure that we're offsetting the electrical consumption of our North Bayshore headquarters with the renewable energy from the new turbines.<br />\n<br />\nSince our first wind investment <a href=\"//googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/not-merely-tilting-at-windmills.html\">in 2010</a>, we\u2019ve developed close relationships with renewable energy providers, helping us secure renewable energy agreements like this one for our campus and data centers\u2014<a href=\"http://www.google.com/green/energy/use/#purchasing\">more than 1.1 gigawatt\u2019s worth</a> to date\u2014and it\u2019s also made it possible for us to make equity investments in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/green/energy/#investments\">17 utility-scale renewable energy projects</a>. And over the years we\u2019ve been thrilled to see other California leaders, from <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-will-invest-850m-in-california-solar-farm/\">tech companies</a> to <a href=\"http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-make-large-purchase-solar-energy-partner-frontier-renewables\">universities</a>, also working to bring more renewable energy online.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, if we can geek out for a minute: We think this project is especially cool because back in the 1980\u2019s, the golden hills of Altamont Pass were an early test bed for the first large-scale wind power technology in the U.S. We\u2019ve been blown away (pun intended :)) by how far turbine technology has come since then. Once the installation is complete, and the 370 legacy turbines are replaced, it will take just 24 new ones to generate as much power as our campus uses in a year.

Maybe you heard a news story about gluten-free diets and pulled up <a href=\"http://g.co/googleapp\">the Google app</a> to ask, \"What is celiac disease?\" Maybe a co-worker shook your hand and later found out she had pink eye, so you looked up \u201cpink eye\u201d to see whether it\u2019s contagious. Or maybe you were worried about a loved one\u2014like I was, recently, when my infant son Veer fell off a bed in a hotel in rural Vermont, and I was concerned that he might have a concussion. I wasn\u2019t able to search and quickly find the information I urgently needed (and I work at Google!).<br />\n<br />\nThankfully my son was OK, but the point is this stuff really matters: one in 20 Google searches are for health-related information. And you should find the health information you need more quickly and easily. <br />\n<br />\nSo starting in the next few days, when you ask Google about common health conditions, you\u2019ll start getting relevant medical facts right up front from the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html\">Knowledge Graph</a>. We\u2019ll show you typical symptoms and treatments, as well as details on how common the condition is\u2014whether it\u2019s critical, if it\u2019s contagious, what ages it affects, and more. For some conditions you\u2019ll also see high-quality illustrations from licensed medical illustrators. Once you get this basic info from Google, you should find it easier to do more research on other sites around the web, or know what questions to ask your doctor.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KutWxLtJgzE/VNlxVLji2MI/AAAAAAAAPwk/ei4NkzspBz4/s1600/health-info-animated.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KutWxLtJgzE/VNlxVLji2MI/AAAAAAAAPwk/ei4NkzspBz4/s1600/health-info-animated.gif\" height=\"400\" width=\"225\" /></a></div>We worked with a team of medical doctors (led by our own Dr. Kapil Parakh, M.D., MPH, Ph.D.) to carefully compile, curate, and review this information. All of the gathered facts represent real-life clinical knowledge from these doctors and high-quality medical sources across the web, and the information has been checked by medical doctors at Google and the Mayo Clinic for accuracy.<br />\n<br />\nThat doesn\u2019t mean these search results are intended as medical advice. We know that cases can vary in severity from person to person, and that there are bound to be exceptions. What we present is intended for informational purposes only\u2014and you should always consult a healthcare professional if you have a medical concern. <br />\n<br />\nBut we hope this can empower you in your health decisions by helping you learn more about common conditions. We\u2019re rolling it out over the next few days, in the U.S. in English to start. In the long run, not only do we plan to cover many more medical conditions, but we also want to extend this to other parts of the world. So the next time you need info on frostbite symptoms, or treatments for tennis elbow, or the basics on measles, the Google app will be a better place to start. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Prem Ramaswami, Product Manager</span>", "id": "1234369118889353200", "updated": "2015-09-15T08:16:29-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["search"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/1234369118889353200/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2015-02-10T02:00:00-08:00", "title": "A remedy for your health-related questions: health info in the Knowledge Graph"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/02/through-google-lens-search-trends.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDQyMzMwMjc4NDU0Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/6653348498360704907", "content": "From a shark with two left feet to a sequel that has everyone buzzing, here\u2019s what trended on search this week.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Haven\u2019t we been here before?&nbsp;</b><br />\nThis past Monday, the U.S. turned to its dirt-dwelling psychic, the groundhog, to determine if it was finally time to put our snow boots back in the closet.

In a culture whose history goes back 50,000 years, 70 young girls are using technology to give their families a new way to call for help in emergencies. Last year, Engineers Without Borders Australia taught a group of students to build an emergency response beacon using basic hardware and some code to transmit a user\u2019s location and distress message via radio.<br />\n<br />\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up less than 3 percent of Australia\u2019s population, and they\u2019ve historically faced discrimination in society, including in education. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, dropout rates exceed 60 percent in certain regions and Aboriginal students are, on average, 2.5 years behind their peers in scientific and mathematical literacy. The problem is often compounded for girls, who tend to be left out of educational opportunities.<br />\n<br />\nSo <a href=\"http://www.ewb.org.au/\">Engineers Without Borders Australia</a> (EWBA) set out to close the educational and digital divide, developing a program which brings together Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal girls to create emergency beacons from scratch by coding a Raspberry Pi to work with an LED, GPS module and FM transmitter. It will also work through issues of stereotyping and discrimination, and help the girls to better understand each other\u2019s worlds.<br />\n<br />\nThis is just one example of an organization doing extraordinary work to make computer science (CS) education available to women and other underrepresented minorities. Computer science has tremendous potential to make a real difference in the world\u2014but only when more people can access and harness it.<br />\n<br />\nThat\u2019s the idea behind Google\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.google.com/edu/rise\">RISE Awards</a>, through which we support organizations in their work to inspire students around the world with CS. Since 2010, more than 200 organizations have received an award, and this year, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/edu/resources/programs/google-rise-awards/#!award-recipients\">37 organizations</a> are receiving a cumulative $1.5 million to keep this vital effort humming along. Our partners facilitate programs and activities including teaching girls about the <a href=\"https://www.womensaudiomission.org/\">intersection of coding and music production in California</a>, promoting computational thinking through <a href=\"http://sgd.cs.colorado.edu/wiki/Scalable_Game_Design_Mexico:_Chic@s_Code\">game-design in Mexico</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.computacaonaescola.ufsc.br/\">inspiring children in Brazil to program alongside their parents</a>. <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEICKDdCszA\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\nThis year, three nonprofits will receive a new \u201cRISE Partnership Award\u201d\u2014a grant to work with one or two partner organizations to help grow their CS outreach to a wider scale. One of the three is Engineers Without Borders Australia, which plans to work with MEET\u2014an organization with expertise on how coding skills can build relationships and break down stereotypes\u2014to integrate their curriculum to reach up to 2,000 girls across Australia, including in Aboriginal communities.<br />\n<br />\nWith access to hands-on CS education, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander girls are preparing themselves for the digital economy, contributing to the diversity of our future\u2019s technology, and taking concrete steps to rise above the inequities their community has faced for decades. They\u2019re not alone. We hope that through the RISE Awards and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/diversity/\">our other efforts</a> to support diversity in technology, these girls and others like them can have an even greater impact.

It\u2019s a holiday that\u2019s especially meaningful this year: 2015 marks the 50th anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/#q=Selma+to+Montgomery+March\">Selma to Montgomery March</a>, and it\u2019s a time when civil rights is at the forefront of our national conversation. <br />\n<br />\nNext Monday, Googlers across the country are heeding the call to give back to their communities, and we hope you\u2019ll join us. Take some time to honor Dr. King by volunteering in your community\u2014you can find opportunities at <a href=\"http://allforgood.org/\">All for Good</a>. In the meantime, here\u2019s a look at some of the projects Googlers will be participating in, and the reasons why they\u2019ve made the commitment to serve this MLK Day. <br />\n<br />\nDona Bellow, a legal assistant, will be helping middle school students in New York with computer science and STEM activities. She says, \"doing something to help further the goals of someone else is reclaiming power: power to choose love over conflict, power to recognize and celebrate our differences, power to achieve an equitable outcome for all.\u201d <br />\n<br />\nIn California, Googlers will be volunteering with the Northern California Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Foundation  as it hosts <a href=\"http://sfmlkday.org/Events.html\">a full day of festivities</a> including the annual parade/march in San Francisco. Eliana Murillo, who is head of multicultural marketing and will be participating in Monday\u2019s event, told us that \u201cgiving a hand to those in need helps build compassion and understanding of the diversity of life experiences.\u201d <br />\n<br />\nLeadership coordinator Aerica Banks says that she serves to \u201dbreak down barriers and build community. We are all able to serve, and we all stand to benefit.\u201d She helped organize volunteers in our Atlanta office for the Atlanta Food Bank Kids In Need program event, which provides school supplies free of charge to teachers in low-income schools. <br />\n<br />\nAnd Fabian Elliott, from our ads team in Chicago, helped organize Google volunteers in the Windy City to help middle school students practice compassion by writing letters to children struggling with terminal illnesses. He says, \u201cEven the most obscure challenges of the world impact each of us at varying levels...It\u2019s as simple as doing something that you love that supports a cause you believe in. What are you waiting for?\u201d <br />\n<br />\nDr. King said: \"Life's most persistent and urgent question is: 'What are you doing for others?'\" Googler volunteers are joining in the national efforts to honor the legacy of Dr. King\u2014and we know that a commitment to service goes well beyond Monday. So we also <a href=\"http://www.google.org/community/\">support projects</a> throughout the year to help to deepen our connections with local communities.

Now <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/about/intl/en_ALL/#\">Google Translate</a> can be your guide in new ways. We\u2019ve updated the Translate app on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&amp;hl=en\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-translate/id414706506?mt=8\">iOS</a> to transform your mobile device into an even more powerful translation tool. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Instant translation with Word Lens </b><br />\nThe Translate app already lets you use camera mode to snap a photo of text and get a translation for it in 36 languages. Now, we\u2019re taking it to the next level and letting you instantly translate text using your camera\u2014so it\u2019s way easier to navigate street signs in the Italian countryside or decide what to order off a Barcelona menu. While using the Translate app, just point your camera at a sign or text and you\u2019ll see the translated text overlaid on your screen\u2014even if you don't have an Internet or data connection. <br />\n<br />\nThis instant translation currently works for translation from English to and from French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish, and we\u2019re working to expand to more languages.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-80X1LKaBFLI/VLXQYFGAR6I/AAAAAAAAPsQ/4R74bu0PbYQ/s1600/Google%2BWord%2BLens%2BiPhone%2BGIF.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-80X1LKaBFLI/VLXQYFGAR6I/AAAAAAAAPsQ/4R74bu0PbYQ/s1600/Google%2BWord%2BLens%2BiPhone%2BGIF.gif\" /></a></div><b>Have an easier conversation using the Translate app </b><br />\nWhen talking with someone in an unfamiliar language, conversations can... get... realllllllly... sloowwww.

For the rest of the conversation, you won\u2019t need to tap the mic again\u2014it'll be ready as you need it. Asking for directions to the Rive Gauche, ordering <i>bacalhau</i> in Lisbon, or chatting with your grandmother in her native Spanish just got a lot faster. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/jZII2ksensw\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\n</div>These updates will be coming to both Android and iOS, rolling out over the next few days.

The shooters targeted the publication in response to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/world/europe/french-magazine-publishes-cartoons-mocking-muhammad.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Europe&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article&amp;_r=0\">satirical cartoons</a> depicting the Prophet Mohammed.

A manhunt for the suspects finally ended Friday in a standoff at a printing company just outside of Paris, in which the two brothers behind the attacks were killed.

And we're joining in to help spread the <a href=\"https://happyholidays.withgoogle.com/\">holiday cheer</a>. This month, Google.org is giving more than $15 million in grants to organizations using technology to address some of the world\u2019s biggest problems. From San Francisco to Western Africa, these organizations are making a direct impact on people around the world, every day. <br />\n<br />\nOne of our grants will go to <a href=\"http://google.org/global-impact-awards/feeding-america/\">Feeding America</a>. Each year, billions of pounds of surplus food are sent to landfills, while <a href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/err-economic-research-report/err173.aspx\">49 million Americans</a> (including one in five children) go hungry. Our grant will help support their newest food rescue initiative called the Online Marketplace, a program that connects local retail and foodservice businesses who have excess food to those in need. Feeding America serves 3.3 billion meals annually and the Online Marketplace is projected to lead to the recovery of an additional 740 million meals, significantly reducing food waste while giving more families access to food. <br />\n<br />\nTwo of our other grantees are working on the front lines to help ensure lives aren't lost to preventable diseases. <a href=\"http://google.org/global-impact-awards/nexleaf/\">Nexleaf Analytics</a> works to get life-saving vaccines to children in India and Mozambique by preserving these vaccines before they spoil by installing low-cost refrigerator sensors in clinics. <a href=\"http://google.org/global-impact-awards/seed-funding/#content-malaria-no-more\">Malaria No More</a> is fighting to save lives by better understanding the spread of malaria using newly available mobile data to map malaria cases and how they are being treated.<br />\n<br />\nTo learn more about additional nonprofits we\u2019re supporting through these grants, and to see how you can get involved with their efforts, visit <a href=\"http://g.co/happyholidays\">g.co/happyholidays</a> and see our slideshow below: \n<style type=\"text/css\">\n    .carousel-container {\n    position: relative;\n    padding-bottom: 70%;\n    height: 0;\n}\n\n.carousel-container iframe {\n    position: absolute;\n    top:0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n}      \n\n    </style>  <br />\n<div class=\"carousel-container\">\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LWwY7QyypmNjxekZfEDXafTqS5IIdoEM9hIQMthxxEY/embed?start=false&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe><br />\n<br /></div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<br />\nThese are only part of our annual philanthropic efforts.

Scouts will have personal cookie webpages where people can place orders online; the idea is that girls will learn more about online marketing and e-commerce while satisfying the sweet teeth of the rest of us. It brings a whole new meaning to the phrase \u201cInternet cookies.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<b>Astronomical views</b><br />\nIf you weren\u2019t at the mall last weekend, then chances are you were on YouTube, watching the new <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Star+Wars+Trailer&amp;std=20141128&amp;pn=p1#a=20141128-Star+Wars+Trailer\">trailer</a> for <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i>. The first teaser for the J.J. Abrams-helmed \u201cEpisode 7\u201d has racked up tens of millions of views since it came out a week ago and people are saying it could become <a href=\"http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/12/05/star-wars-force-awakens-by-the-numbers/\">the most viewed trailer ever</a>. Fans have intensely scrutinized and discussed each one of the trailer\u2019s 88 seconds in detail; and there are already spoofs and recreations galore, including Wes Anderson and LEGO versions. The movie won\u2019t be out until December 2015, so you have plenty of time to build your crossguard lightsaber for the premiere. <br />\n<br />\nBut even after two years, there\u2019s no video in the YouTube galaxy that\u2019s quite like \u201cGangnam Style.\u201d It\u2019s the first video to ever get more than 2 billion views, and this week, its view count crossed 2,147,483,647. That happens to be the highest number that can be represented by a 32-bit integer, and also\u2014until recently\u2014the highest number that the YouTube view counter could display. Luckily, our friends at YouTube saw this one coming: They upgraded the view counter to use a 64-bit integer, capable of representing numbers up to  9,223,372,036,854,775,808. Yup, that\u2019s 9 quintillion.

The tradition of the tree lighting ceremony dates back to 1923 when President Calvin Coolidge lit the first fir tree outside the White House, and this is the first year kids from across the country will be in control of the state and territory holiday tree  lights!<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-rHPqt6_MuBA%2FVHz2_jDQrDI%2FAAAAAAAAPoM%2Fx84T75fcy9A%2Fs1600%2FMade%252Bwith%252BCode%252BHoliday%252BTree%252B(7).gif&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-rHPqt6_MuBA%2FVHz2_jDQrDI%2FAAAAAAAAPoM%2Fx84T75fcy9A%2Fs1600%2FMade%252Bwith%252BCode%252BHoliday%252BTree%252B(7).gif&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n<br />\nAs the mom of two girls, I know that technology is a pathway for their future success. Still, even as coding becomes more important, less than 1% of high school girls say they\u2019re interested in pursuing computer sciences in college.  But I'm also an engineer, so I\u2019ve seen firsthand how exciting CS can be. I fell in love with code early\u2014my dad was an engineer and he encouraged me to enter a programming competition in the seventh grade. I gave it a shot, and I\u2019ve never looked back. Ever since that day, I\u2019ve known that when I program something, I\u2019m creating something totally new for the world.<br />\n<br />\nThat\u2019s what Made with Code is about: discovering that creating something new and exciting\u2014whether it\u2019s a holiday tree, a video game or a driverless car\u2014can be accomplished with the power of code.<br />\n<br />\nBut it\u2019s also about building an ecosystem of support for girls through parents and teachers, and to show girls other women who are using CS to achieve their dreams. This challenge also kicks off Google\u2019s commitment to CSEdWeek, a week dedicated to inspiring students to get interested in computer science that\u2019s become one of the biggest education initiatives online.  Over the coming week, thousands of Googlers will join the <a href=\"http://csedweek.org/\">hour of code</a>, and announce a few other special projects that we will fund through the holiday season and coming year.<br />\n<br />\nI\u2019m heading to Washington, D.C. this week to be a part of the ceremony, and I\u2019m looking forward to watching the designs from girls across the country lighting up the nation\u2019s capital\u2014and inspiring my daughters and so many others with the power of code. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Pavni Diwanji, Vice President, Engineering</span>", "id": "8244111398984846304", "updated": "2014-12-02T15:05:29-08:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["diversity", "education"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/8244111398984846304/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2014-12-02T07:03:00-08:00", "title": "This year the holidays are Made with Code "}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/12/race-with-rudolph-and-skydive-with.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDE3NDU2ODAwNjcxCm9mZnNldDogLTI4ODAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/1008653567948811778", "content": "December may mean snow days in Denver, Colo. or beach days in Sydney, Australia, but in <a href=\"http://google.com/santatracker\">Santa\u2019s Village</a>, it means the countdown to Santa\u2019s big night.

He got his wings in 1944 and stayed in the Army for 30 years. When I think of him\u2014and all the other veterans I grew up knowing\u2014I\u2019m reminded of the unique characteristics they shared: their innate courage, sense of purpose, and their ability to lead under pressure. Most remarkable to me, though, is their belief in the power of sacrificing and fighting for something bigger than yourself. <br />\n<br />\nFor everyone who has served our country, I join 1,000+ members of the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/careers/veterans/our-community.html\">Google Veterans Network</a> in celebrating Veterans Day today. And I am incredibly proud of what Google has done to honor veterans, including two initiatives new this year. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Veterans make great Googlers</b><br />\nWe hire leaders, team builders and problem solvers and many veterans are already doing amazing things at the company. But we also know that not all veterans have the same skills and interests; there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution and it can be hard to understand how you might fit into a corporate environment. So we\u2019ve created a new <a href=\"http://g.co/vets\">Veterans Careers</a> website to help servicemembers and veterans find the right role to apply for at Google. The site breaks down some of the ways our own veterans are succeeding in both technical and general roles. In their own words, they explain how their skills translated and how they are continuing to serve through their work at Google.<br />\n<br />\nAnd for those who have other career goals in mind, we\u2019ve included a few <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/careers/veterans/more-resources.html\">resources</a>\u2014like mentoring programs and virtual classes\u2014to help veterans and their families as they transition to civilian life.<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/NHz-iGYs5Mo\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\n<b>Sharing veterans\u2019 stories</b><br />\nIn addition to making Google a great place to work for veterans, we want to use our technology to build greater awareness and understanding of their achievements and sacrifices. Last Friday, the <a href=\"http://www.911memorial.org/\">9/11 Memorial</a> opened a new exhibit that explores the immediate and heroic actions of U.S. servicemembers, alongside those of the emergency workers who responded on and after September 11, 2001. \u201cThe Call to Serve,\u201d an interactive installation powered by Google <a href=\"http://g.co/tourbuilder\">Tour Builder</a>, follows the stories of nine veterans and military personnel to honor their service and that of all who followed in their footsteps. You can visit the exhibit in person at the 9/11 Museum during Veterans Week or online at <a href=\"http://veterans.911memorial.org/\">911memorial.org/calltoserve</a>. <br />\n<br />\nThis effort also builds on other historical preservation projects we announced earlier this year, including bringing <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@38.876393,-77.072408,3a,75y,92.16h,91.95t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1s_CLrX_eTGD8oQ2UPLi2MfQ!2e0!3e5\">Arlington National Cemetery</a>, including the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and The Eternal Flame, to Street View; and commemorating the 70th anniversary of the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/entity/%2Fm%2F01lhv6\">landings at Normandy</a> in partnership with museums and archives in the U.S., U.K. and France. <br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re proud to pay tribute to veterans\u2019 service and and to support them in their careers. Veterans have unique skills and experience, and arrive with a devotion to teamwork that goes a long way around here. They\u2019re among our greatest assets, both as a company and as a nation. And after all they\u2019ve given us, we need to give them every opportunity to succeed.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by David Drummond, SVP, Corporate Development and Chief Legal Officer; Founding Executive Sponsor, Google Veterans Network</span>", "id": "5023144945956930289", "updated": "2014-11-11T06:00:02-08:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/5023144945956930289/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2014-11-11T06:00:00-08:00", "title": "The doors are open for veterans at Google"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/11/with-chromebooks-students-find-new-ways.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDE1NjQxOTczOTEwCm9mZnNldDogLTI4ODAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/3421367256019082395", "content": "<i>Cross-posted on the <a href=\"http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2014/11/with-chromebooks-students-find-new-ways.html\">Google for Education blog</a></i><br />\n<br />\nStudents and schools have done some amazing things with Chromebooks since we first <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/05/new-kind-of-computer-chromebook.html\">launched in 2011</a>.

That\u2019s critical for schools that often want to give their students the best technology, but don\u2019t have a large IT department to support it. And it\u2019s part of what has made Chromebooks such a hit in schools. In fact, according to IDC\u2019s latest report on tablets and laptops in K-12 education, Chromebooks are the best-selling device in the U.S. this year. And they\u2019re continuing to grow in popularity\u2014in districts like Montgomery County, MD (more than 50,000 devices), Charlotte-Mecklenberg, NC (32,000 devices) and Cherry Creek, CO (26,000 devices), who have all begun using Chromebooks in 2014. <br />\n<br />\nBeyond the U.S., countries are looking at how they can use technology in the classroom on a large scale\u2014like in <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/for-malaysia-bringing-google-apps-and.html\">Malaysia</a>, where the entire national school system is using Chromebooks. This week, we\u2019re hosting the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/2ndglobaleducationsympoium/\">Global Education Symposium</a>, a gathering of education ministers from 18 countries working to implement technology that will help them meet their country\u2019s educational agenda. We\u2019ll hear from education leaders who are exploring new educational models, and look at how innovative local schools are using technology to help teachers and students excel. <br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s been thrilling to see how Chromebooks\u2014alongside Android tablets, Google Play for Education, Classroom and Google Apps for Education, which is now used by 40 million students and teachers around the world\u2014can help students meet their learning goals.

It\u2019s called <b>Inbox</b>. Years in the making, Inbox is by the same people who brought you Gmail, but it\u2019s not Gmail: it\u2019s a completely different type of inbox, designed to focus on what really matters. <br />\n<br />\nEmail started simply as a way to send digital notes around the office. But fast-forward 30 years and with just the phone in your pocket, you can use email to contact virtually anyone in the world\u2026from your best friend to the owner of that bagel shop you discovered last week. <br />\n<br />\nWith this evolution comes new challenges: we get more email now than ever, important information is buried inside messages, and our most important tasks can slip through the cracks\u2014especially when we\u2019re working on our phones. For many of us, dealing with email has become a daily chore that distracts from what we really need to do\u2014rather than helping us get those things done.<br />\n<br />\nIf this all sounds familiar, then Inbox is for you. Or more accurately, Inbox works for you. Here are some of the ways Inbox is at your service:<br />\n<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/bzNTjpUMOp4?rel=0\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\n<br />\n<b>Bundles: stay organized automatically</b> <br />\nInbox expands upon the categories we introduced in Gmail last year, making it easy to deal with similar types of mail all at once. For example, all your purchase receipts or bank statements are neatly grouped together so that you can quickly review and then swipe them out of the way. You can even teach Inbox to adapt to the way you work by choosing which emails you\u2019d like to see grouped together. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Highlights: the important info at a glance</b><br />\nInbox highlights the key information from important messages, such as flight itineraries, event information, and photos and documents emailed to you by friends and family. Inbox will even display useful information from the web that wasn\u2019t in the original email, such as the real-time status of your flights and package deliveries. Highlights and Bundles work together to give you just the information you need at a glance.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ER2zK_WbRqU/VEfW8rXOtJI/AAAAAAAABWs/wqr0h77iZoE/s1600/inbox-nexus6-500.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ER2zK_WbRqU/VEfW8rXOtJI/AAAAAAAABWs/wqr0h77iZoE/s600/inbox-nexus6-500.png\" height=\"600\" /></a></div><b>Reminders, Assists, and Snooze: your to-do\u2019s on your own terms</b><br />\nInbox makes it easy to focus on your priorities by letting you add your own Reminders, from picking up the dry cleaning to giving your parents a call. No matter what you need to remember, your inbox becomes a centralized place to keep track of the things you need to get back to. <br />\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--NopP77zG2A/VEfXORfnNSI/AAAAAAAABW0/NfMf8MnDpOk/s1600/bigtopblog_fullres.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--NopP77zG2A/VEfXORfnNSI/AAAAAAAABW0/NfMf8MnDpOk/s400/bigtopblog_fullres.gif\" /></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">A sampling of Assists</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>And speaking of to-do\u2019s, Inbox helps you cross those off your list by providing Assists\u2014handy pieces of information you may need to get the job done. For example, if you write a Reminder to call the hardware store, Inbox will supply the store\u2019s phone number and tell you if it's open. Assists work for your email, too. If you make a restaurant reservation online, Inbox adds a map to your confirmation email. Book a flight online, and Inbox gives a link to check-in.<br />\n<br />\nOf course, not everything needs to be done right now. Whether you\u2019re in an inconvenient place or simply need to focus on something else first, Inbox lets you Snooze away emails and Reminders. You can set them to come back at another time or when you get to a specific location, like your home or your office.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Get started with Inbox</b><br />\nStarting today, we\u2019re sending out the first round of invitations to give Inbox a try, and each new user will be able to invite their friends. If Inbox can\u2019t arrive soon enough for you, you can email us at <a href=\"mailto:inbox@google.com\">inbox@google.com</a> to get an invitation as soon as more become available. <br />\n<br />\nWhen you start using Inbox, you\u2019ll quickly see that it doesn\u2019t feel the same as Gmail\u2014and that\u2019s the point. Gmail\u2019s still there for you, but <a href=\"https://www.google.com/inbox/#utm_source=googleblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=launch\">Inbox is something new</a>. It\u2019s a better way to get back to what matters, and we can\u2019t wait to share it with you.   <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by  Sundar Pichai, SVP, Android, Chrome &amp; Apps</span><br />\n<br />\n<i>Cross-posted from the <a href=\"http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/10/an-inbox-that-works-for-you.html\">Official Gmail Blog</a></i>", "id": "342831880803685722", "updated": "2014-10-28T17:07:38-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/342831880803685722/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2014-10-22T10:00:00-07:00", "title": "An inbox that works for you"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/10/district-voices-inside-panem-with-our.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDEzODIxMTA5NDU2Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/7929383574062849165", "content": "<i>Meet District Voices, the latest campaign in our <a href=\"http://www.artcopycode.com/\">Art, Copy &amp; Code</a> project\u2014where we explore new ways for brands to connect with consumers through experiences that people love, remember and share.

A few years ago, we had the thought that phones (and stuff that hadn\u2019t even been invented yet like tablets and smart watches) would be way more interesting if everyone could build new things together. So we <a href=\"http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/11/google-launches-android-open-mobile.html\">created</a> Android as an open platform, and put it out there for everyone to imagine, invent, make, or buy whatever they wanted. <br />\n<br />\nSince then, all kinds of people\u2014from companies big and small to folks on Kickstarter, kids in schools, and crazy smart developers\u2014have been innovating faster, <i>together</i>, more than we ever could alone. And the best part is that every time someone new joins in, things get more interesting, unexpected, and wonderful for all of us. <br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/AD-oCSoI9OQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br /></div>\nGetting everyone in on the party is the same spirit behind <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/for-next-five-billion-android-one.html\">Android One</a>\u2014an effort recently launched in India (coming to other countries soon) to make great smartphones available to the billions of people around the world who aren\u2019t yet online. It\u2019s also why we\u2019re excited about Lollipop, our newest software release, which is designed to meet the diverse needs of the billion-plus people who already use <a href=\"http://www.android.com/\">Android</a> today.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Joining the party: Android 5.0 Lollipop</b><br />\nAs <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/06/google-io-2014-keynote.html\">previewed</a> at Google I/O, Lollipop is our largest, most ambitious release on Android with over 5,000 new APIs for <a href=\"http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2014/10/android-50-lollipop-sdk-and-nexus.html\">developers</a>. Lollipop is designed to be flexible, to work on all your devices and to be customized for you the way you see fit. And just like Android has always been, it\u2019s designed to be shared. <br />\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zZ1iCaBd2XU/VD4MaIQ1wMI/AAAAAAAAPfQ/t0J7eveSy1Y/s1600/Lollipop%2BForest.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zZ1iCaBd2XU/VD4MaIQ1wMI/AAAAAAAAPfQ/t0J7eveSy1Y/s1600/Lollipop%2BForest.jpg\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" /></a><br />\nLollipop is made for a world where moving throughout the day means interacting with a bunch of different screens\u2014from phones and tablets to TVs. With more devices connecting together, your expectation is that things just work. With Lollipop, it\u2019s easier than ever to pick up where you left off, so the songs, photos, apps, and even recent searches from one of your Android devices can be immediately enjoyed across all the other ones. <br />\n<br />\nAs you switch from one screen to another, the experience should feel the same. So Lollipop has a consistent design across devices\u2014an approach we call <a href=\"http://www.google.com/design\">Material Design</a>. Now content responds to your touch, or even your voice, in more intuitive ways, and transitions between tasks are more fluid.<br />\n<br />\nLollipop also gives you more control over your device. You can now adjust your settings so that only certain people and notifications can get through, for example, when you\u2019re out to dinner or in the middle of an important meeting. And when an important notification does come through, you can see it directly from the lockscreen.<br />\n<br />\nAnd because we\u2019re using our devices a lot more, there\u2019s a new battery saver feature that extends the life of your device by up to 90 minutes\u2014helpful if you\u2019re far from a power outlet. We\u2019ve enabled multiple user accounts and guest user mode for keeping your personal stuff private. And you can now secure your device with a PIN, password, pattern, or even by pairing your phone to a trusted device like your watch or car with Smart Lock. But this is just a small taste of Lollipop. Learn more on <a href=\"http://android.com/\">android.com</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Meet the Nexus family, now running Lollipop</b><br />\nAdvances in computing are driven at the intersection of hardware and software. That's why we\u2019ve always introduced <a href=\"http://google.com/nexus\">Nexus devices</a> alongside our platform releases. Rather than creating software in the abstract, we work with hardware partners to build Nexus devices to help push the boundaries of what's possible. Nexus devices also serve as a reference for the ecosystem as they develop on our newest release. And for Lollipop, we have a few new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk-PY2dBKaA&amp;list=PL-t6ViojWR4x_IZMCGAxpwnHscqfBNk_v\">Nexus treats</a> to share with you.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WrgpWwvjKRA/VD5-8lA9iZI/AAAAAAAAPfg/e6OtUbYu0as/s1600/Nexus-Family.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WrgpWwvjKRA/VD5-8lA9iZI/AAAAAAAAPfg/e6OtUbYu0as/s1600/Nexus-Family.jpg\" height=\"328\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\nFirst, with Motorola, we developed the <a href=\"http://google.com/nexus/6\">Nexus 6</a>. This new phone has a contoured aluminum frame, a 6-inch Quad HD display and a 13 megapixel camera. The large screen is complemented by dual front-facing stereo speakers that deliver high-fidelity sound, making it as great for movies and gaming as it is for doing work. It also comes with a Turbo Charger, so you can get up to six hours of use with only 15 minutes of charge.<br />\n<br />\nNext, a new tablet built in partnership with HTC. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/nexus/9\">Nexus 9</a>, with brushed metal sides and 8.9-inch screen, is small enough to easily carry around in one hand, yet big enough to work on. And since more and more people want to have the same simple experience they have on their tablets when they have to do real work, we designed a keyboard folio that magnetically attaches to the Nexus 9, folds into two different angles and rests securely on your lap like a laptop.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, we\u2019re releasing the first device running Android TV: <a href=\"http://google.com/nexus/player\">Nexus Player</a>, a collaboration with Asus, is a streaming media player for movies, music and videos. It's also a first-of-its-kind Android gaming device. With Nexus Player you can play Android games on your HDTV with a gamepad, then keep playing on your phone while you're on the road. Nexus Player is Google Cast Ready so you can cast your favorite entertainment from almost any Chromebook or Android or iOS phone or tablet to your TV.<br />\n<br />\nNexus 9 and Nexus Player will be available for pre-order on October 17. Nexus 9 will be in stores starting November 3. Nexus 6 will be available for pre-order in late October and in stores in November\u2014with options for an unlocked version through Play store, or a monthly contract or installment plan through carriers, including AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon. Specific carrier rollout timing will vary. Check out <a href=\"http://google.com/nexus\">google.com/nexus</a> for more details on availability.  <br />\n<br />\nAndroid 5.0 Lollipop, which comes on Nexus 6, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player, will also be available on Nexus 4, 5, 7, 10 and Google Play edition devices in the coming weeks.<br />\n<br />\n<b>The party\u2019s just getting started</b><br />\nWith this latest release of Android Lollipop, we're excited to continue working with our developer community, hardware partners, and all of you. More ideas and more creators is what gets us all to better ideas faster. And since everyone's invited to the party, we hope you'll join in the fun by <a href=\"http://www.androidify.com/\">creating and sharing an Android character</a> that captures a little bit of who you are\u2014one of a kind.

But how, why and where do people use voice search? To find out, we commissioned a study, conducted by Northstar Research, surveying 1,400 Americans across all age groups. Here are the results:<br />\n<br />\nWe weren\u2019t surprised to find that teens\u2014always ahead of the curve when it comes to new technology\u2014talk to their phones more than the average adult. More than half of teens (13-18) use voice search daily\u2014to them it\u2019s as natural as checking social media or taking selfies. Adults are also getting the hang of it, with 41 percent talking to their phones every day and 56 percent admitting it makes them \u201cfeel tech savvy.\u201d<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lxYdOZ6knwI/VD2RJ8udfOI/AAAAAAAAPeM/XfQGUOTCF24/s1600/Voice1-p01.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lxYdOZ6knwI/VD2RJ8udfOI/AAAAAAAAPeM/XfQGUOTCF24/s1600/Voice1-p01.jpg\" height=\"396\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\nBoth teens and adults are asking their phones for directions and using it to help skip the hassle of typing in phone numbers. And it\u2019s pretty clear a lot of people are relying on voice search for multitasking: they talk to their phones while watching TV (38 percent) and 23 percent of adults use voice search while cooking. Apparently, it\u2019s becoming common kitchen etiquette to ask your mobile device: \u201cOk Google, how many ounces are in a gallon?\u201d\u2014all while making sure your screen stays crumb-free. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6vq_ZlqGtL0/VD2RJ6pvQ2I/AAAAAAAAPeE/J4Yz0lrg74M/s1600/Voice1-p02.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6vq_ZlqGtL0/VD2RJ6pvQ2I/AAAAAAAAPeE/J4Yz0lrg74M/s600/Voice1-p02.jpg\" height=\"600\" /></a></div>\nWhile people of all ages ask practical questions, it\u2019s teens who are exploring all angles, with nearly one-third talking to their phones to get help with homework. I see my kids asking my phone questions like: \u201cOk Google, who was the sixth president of the U.S.?\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s the tallest mountain in Europe?\u201d On the bright side, teens are ditching voice search in the classroom: 74 percent of them think using voice search at school is unacceptable. In fact, most admit to using voice search \u201cjust for fun\u201d\u2014I know my daughter finds it pretty amusing to tell her phone: \u201cOk Google, play Olivia Holt\u2019s \u2018Fearless\u2019\u201d to start a dance party.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p0rGkyZF0Bo/VD2RKM5IJgI/AAAAAAAAPeI/-CkBf4WNuzU/s1600/Voice1-p03.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p0rGkyZF0Bo/VD2RKM5IJgI/AAAAAAAAPeI/-CkBf4WNuzU/s600/Voice1-p03.jpg\" height=\"600\" /></a></div>\nAnd teens don\u2019t seem to associate any stigma with using voice search while hanging out with friends, whereas only one-quarter of adults speak to their phones when in the company of others. Teens don\u2019t mind talking to devices in private as well, with more than one in five admitting to using voice search while in the bathroom! Maybe they\u2019re merely setting reminders like \u201cOk Google, remind mom to buy toilet paper next time we\u2019re at Safeway.\u201d<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zr6rDTFVxQM/VD2RKov0H0I/AAAAAAAAPeU/tTv44qRdvQ8/s1600/Voice1-p04.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zr6rDTFVxQM/VD2RKov0H0I/AAAAAAAAPeU/tTv44qRdvQ8/s600/Voice1-p04.jpg\" height=\"600\" /></a></div>\nThough it\u2019s already helping a lot of people save time and simplify their days, there\u2019s also potential for voice search to do a lot more in the future. So we asked people what they wished voice search could one day deliver. And I have to say, I agree with the results! it would be great to rely on my voice to easily find my car keys or TV remote, both of which somehow always end up under the couch cushions.<br />\n<br />\nAnd I\u2019m not alone in wishing a simple voice command could save me from having to cook dinner. Forty-five percent of teens\u2014and 36 percent of adults!\u2014wish they could place a pizza delivery order using voice search on their mobile device. We\u2019re not quite there yet, but next time you don\u2019t feel like cooking, just pull out your phone, tap the Google app, and say: \u201cOk Google, call Round Table Pizza.\u201d You\u2019ll still have to place your order over the phone, but we\u2019re getting closer! <br />\n<br />\n<i><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">The small print: The study was commissioned by Google and executed by Northstar Research, a global consulting firm.

As a former startup ourselves, entrepreneurship is still part of Google's DNA. That\u2019s why two and a half years ago we opened our first <a href=\"https://www.googleforentrepreneurs.com/campuses/\">Campus</a> in London, a space designed to help entrepreneurs learn, connect, and build companies. <br />\n<br />\nCampus is a hub for the startup community, where entrepreneurs can fuel up on caffeine at the Campus Cafe, gather in our free event space, rent coworking space, and connect with mentors, accelerators and Google teams. So far, we\u2019ve seen great results at our first locations, <a href=\"https://www.campuslondon.com/\">Campus London</a> and <a href=\"http://campustelaviv.com/\">Campus Tel Aviv</a>. In 2013, startups at Campus London raised more than $54 million in funding and created more than 570 jobs. They\u2019ve also created great products and services that are reaching consumers and customers. For example, <a href=\"https://www.borrowmydoggy.com/\">Borrow My Doggy</a>, which began at a <a href=\"http://startupweekend.org/\">Startup Weekend</a> in London and also received funding from Seedcamp, one of our partners, lets dog owners with limited time for walking share their pooches with city dwellers who can't have their own. <a href=\"http://eyeteasemedia.com/\">Eyetease</a>, which created a HD digital taxitop and high-speed WiFi system for taxis, has been a resident at Campus since their launch and have grown their revenue 100X during that time. In Tel Aviv, local community groups have hosted more than 1,000 events at Campus (and consumed 6,000+ slices of free pizza!). <br />\n<br />\nBuilding on the success of these spaces, this year we've announced new Campuses in Warsaw, Poland, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and Seoul, South Korea. And today, we\u2019re welcoming another new member to the Campus family:<b> Campus Madrid</b>. We\u2019re excited to open doors in all these new locations in 2015. Each of these cities has a growing startup community, as well as a Google office so our teams can get directly involved with supporting Campus. We hosted more than 1,000 Google mentoring sessions through our Campus Office Hours Program in London, and are planning similar efforts at our other locations.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/---aFhQGMN3A/VDK-v4XPWCI/AAAAAAAAPbM/85ChAONo2_o/s1600/Campus%2BCafe.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/---aFhQGMN3A/VDK-v4XPWCI/AAAAAAAAPbM/85ChAONo2_o/s1600/Campus%2BCafe.jpg\" height=\"266\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\nWe\u2019re also trying out new programs at all our locations to help even more aspiring entrepreneurs succeed.

Five World Series, more than 3,000 hits and nearly 20 years later, this weekend he will take to the diamond for a final game at Fenway against his archrivals, the Boston Red Sox. Though neither the Yankees nor the Sox made this season\u2019s playoffs, anticipation for Jeter\u2019s farewell at-bat was already high. But last night, after giving baseball fans so many memorable moments over the years, he gave us one more. In his final game at Yankee Stadium, Jeter\u2019s ninth-inning walk-off single gave the Yankees a win over the Orioles, provided the world another excuse to search for the star shortstop, and was a fitting ending to Jeter\u2019s fairy-tale career. <br />\n<br />\nOver on the political field, Attorney General <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Eric+Holder&amp;std=20140925&amp;pn=p1#a=20140925-Eric+Holder\">Eric Holder</a> announced on Thursday that he is stepping down.

Were people shooting videos incorrectly? No. Our early design was the problem. It was designed for right-handed users, but phones are usually rotated 180 degrees when held in left hands. Without realizing it, we\u2019d created an app that worked best for our almost exclusively right-handed developer team.<br />\n<br />\nThis is just one example of how unconscious biases influence our actions every day, even when\u2014by definition\u2014we don\u2019t notice them. These biases are shaped by our experiences and by cultural norms, and allow us to filter information and make quick decisions. We\u2019ve evolved to trust our guts. But sometimes these mental shortcuts can lead us astray, especially when they cause us to misjudge people. In the workplace, for example, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect\">halo effect</a> can cause us to inflate performance ratings or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroup_bias\">in-group bias</a> can lead us to overlook great talent. <br />\n<br />\nCombatting our unconscious biases is hard, because they don\u2019t feel wrong; they feel right. But it\u2019s necessary to fight against bias in order to create a work environment that supports and encourages diverse perspectives and people. Not only is that the right thing to do, but without a diverse workforce, there\u2019s a pretty good chance that our products\u2014just like that early YouTube app\u2014won\u2019t work for everyone. That means we need to make the unconscious, conscious. <br />\n<br />\nThe first step is education; we need to help people identify and understand their biases so that they can start to combat them. So we developed a workshop, <a href=\"https://www.gv.com/lib/unconscious-bias-at-work\">Unconscious Bias @ Work</a>, in which more than 26,000 Googlers have taken part. And it\u2019s made an impact: Participants were significantly more aware, had greater understanding, and were more motivated to overcome bias.<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/NW5s_-Nl3JE\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\nIn addition to our workshop, we\u2019re partnering with organizations like the <a href=\"http://gender.stanford.edu/\">Clayman Institute</a> and the <a href=\"http://adainitiative.org/\">Ada Initiative</a> to further research and awareness. We\u2019re also taking action to ensure that the decisions we make at work\u2014from promoting employees to marketing products\u2014are objective and fair. Here are four ways we're working to reduce the influence of bias:<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n<li><b>Gather facts.</b> It\u2019s hard to know you\u2019re improving if you\u2019re not measuring. We collect data on things like gender representation <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-to-raise-the-profile-of-women-and-minorities-in-science/\">in our doodles</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/google-io-women-20-percent/\">at our conferences</a>.</li>\n<li><b>Create a structure for making decisions. </b>Define clear criteria to evaluate the merits of each option, and use them consistently. Using the same standards to evaluate all options can reduce bias. This is why we use <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;\">structured interviews</a> in hiring, applying the same selection and evaluation methods for all.</li>\n<li><b>Be mindful of subtle cues. </b>Who\u2019s included and who\u2019s excluded? In 2013, Googlers pointed out that of the dozens of conference rooms named after famous scientists, only a few were female. Was this our vision for the future? No. So we changed Ferdinand von Zeppelin to Florence Nightingale\u2014along with many others\u2014to create more balanced representation. Seemingly small changes can have big effects.</li>\n<li><b>Foster awareness. Hold yourself\u2014and your colleagues\u2014accountable. </b>We\u2019re encouraging Googlers to call out bias. For example, we share a \u201cbias busting checklist\u201d at performance reviews, encouraging managers to examine their own biases and call out those of others.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nAs we <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/getting-to-work-on-diversity-at-google.html\">shared</a> back in May, we\u2019re not where we should be when it comes to diversity. But in order to get there, we need to have this conversation. We have to figure out where our biases lie, and we have to combat them. Tackling unconscious bias at work is just one piece of making Google a diverse workplace, but it\u2019s absolutely essential if we\u2019re going to live up to our promise to build technology that makes life better for as many people as possible. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Laszlo Bock, SVP of People Operations, and Brian Welle, Ph.D., Director of People Analytics</span>", "id": "9144507794557008805", "updated": "2014-09-25T08:00:02-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["diversity"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/9144507794557008805/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2014-09-25T08:00:00-07:00", "title": "You don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know: How our unconscious minds undermine the workplace"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/for-those-who-dream-big-announcing.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDExNTA2OTkxOTcxCm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/5435367818900548466", "content": "Ciara Judge, \u00c9mer Hickey and Sophie Healy-Thow became interested in addressing the global food crisis after learning about the Horn of Africa famine in 2011.

I\u2019ve long been inspired by the Internet and how it opens the doors to opportunity. It provides access to knowledge, no matter who you are or where you are. For instance, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a Nobel Laureate at a world-class research center or a young student at a rural school in Indonesia, with Google Search, you have the same information at your fingertips as anyone else.<br />\n<br />\nIf we look at how people are getting online and accessing information today, increasingly it\u2019s through a smartphone. While 1.75 billion people around the world already have a smartphone, the vast majority of the world\u2019s population\u2014over five billion more\u2014do not. That means most people are only able to make simple voice calls, rather than connect with family through a live video chat, use mapping apps to find the closest hospital, or simply search the web. We want to bring these experiences to more people. <br />\n<br />\nThat\u2019s where <a href=\"http://www.android.com/one\">Android One</a> comes in. At I/O, we <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/06/google-io-2014-keynote.html\">first talked</a> about this initiative to make high-quality smartphones accessible to as many people as possible. And today we\u2019re introducing the first family of Android One phones <a href=\"http://www.android.com/one/india\">in India</a>. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tQ8wYvVKQnM/VBYiMPEPgPI/AAAAAAAAPXE/GYeNagvTVIE/s1600/Android-One_white.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tQ8wYvVKQnM/VBYiMPEPgPI/AAAAAAAAPXE/GYeNagvTVIE/s400/Android-One_white.png\" height=\"93\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n<b>Addressing key barriers\u2014hardware, software and connectivity</b><br />\nThere are three big reasons why it\u2019s hard for people in countries such as India, Indonesia or the Philippines to get their hands on a high-quality smartphone. First, is the hardware itself. Even entry-level smartphones still remain out of reach for many (bear in mind that in some of these countries the average monthly income is around $250). Second, many people in these markets do not have access to the latest Android software and popular applications. Finally, even where 3G and 4G networks are available, not enough people have phones that can support data and the plans can be expensive. <br />\n<br />\nAndroid One aims to help tackle these challenges. By working closely with phone and silicon chip makers to share reference designs and select components, we\u2019re making it easier for our partners to build phones that are not just great to use, but also affordable. They have lots of processing power, so you can get information quickly. They have high-quality front- and rear-facing cameras. And for all those pictures, along with your apps and videos, Android One phones will have expandable storage. We also added features that people in India will find particularly useful, like dual SIM cards, a replaceable battery and built-in FM radio. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lHw5suXP8VY/VBYiNuSeTCI/AAAAAAAAPXM/ruRKn0IUTYM/s1600/group_UI-visible.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lHw5suXP8VY/VBYiNuSeTCI/AAAAAAAAPXM/ruRKn0IUTYM/s400/group_UI-visible.jpg\" height=\"400\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\nTo help ensure a consistent experience, Android One devices will receive the latest versions of Android directly from Google. So you\u2019ll get all the latest features, up-to-date security patches, and peace of mind knowing your stuff is always backed up. It also means Android One devices will be some of the first to be updated to the Android L release later this year. For our hardware partners, they\u2019ll be able to create customized experiences and differentiate their devices without having to change the core software.<br />\n<br />\nIn an effort to reduce data costs, if you have an Airtel SIM card, you\u2019ll get these software updates for free for the first six months. As part of this same Airtel offer, you\u2019ll also be able to download up to 200MB per month worth of your favorite apps (that\u2019s about 50 apps overall) from Google Play\u2014all without counting toward your mobile data usage. <br />\n<b><br />\n</b> <b>More to come</b><br />\nThis is just the beginning of the Android One journey. The first phones, from our hardware partners Micromax, Karbonn, Spice and chipmaker MediaTek, are available starting today in India from leading retailers starting at <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?q=6399inr%20to%20usd#safe=active&amp;q=6399inr+to+usd\">Rs 6,399</a>. We\u2019re also excited to welcome more partners to the program, including phone manufacturers Acer, Alcatel Onetouch, ASUS, HTC, Intex, Lava, Lenovo, Panasonic, Xolo, and chipmaker Qualcomm. We expect to see even more high-quality, affordable devices with different screen sizes, colors, hardware configurations and customized software experiences. Finally, we plan to expand the Android One program to Indonesia, the Philippines and South Asia (Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) by the end of the year, with more countries to follow in 2015.<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/X7UPR9z3OV8\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\nAccess for access\u2019s sake is not enough. With Android One, we not only want to help people get online, we want to make sure that when they get there, they can tap into the wealth of information and knowledge the web holds for everyone.  <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Sundar Pichai, SVP, Android, Chrome &amp; Apps</span>", "id": "3055572579311921287", "updated": "2014-09-15T02:12:44-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["Android"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/3055572579311921287/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2014-09-15T02:12:00-07:00", "title": "For the next five billion: Android One"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/through-google-lens-search-trends-sept.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDExNDkwNTY0NTE3Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/627992344481202082", "content": "New phones, new games, new looks.

But if you\u2019re blind or have low vision, you may need to rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers and Braille displays\u2014and that can make working in the cloud challenging.

But we want to build devices that you can use when you need and forget about when you don\u2019t\u2014technology that's built for your sake, rather than its own sake. Coming throughout the rest of this year, we're making some updates to Wear that will help you get even more out of your watch\u2014and the rest of your life, too. <br />\n<br />\nFirst, we're bringing <b>offline music playback</b> and <b>GPS support</b> to Android Wear. Go for a run or bike ride with your Android wearable and leave your phone at home. You\u2019ll be able to listen to music stored on your watch via Bluetooth headphones. And if your watch includes a GPS sensor, you can track your distance and speed too. <br />\n<br />\nThe second update will enable <b>downloadable watch faces</b>, so you can customize the visual design of your watch's home screen to show the information you want to see most\u2014like your calendar or fitness sensors.

For Google Maps to get you there, it needs to be a digital mirror of the real world. But the real world is always changing. So to make sure your map is an accurate reflection of your world, we started <a href=\"http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2012/12/building-better-map-of-europe.html\">Ground Truth</a>, a project that brings the freshest, most relevant information to Google Maps. <br />\n<br />\nToday, we\u2019ve reached our 50th Ground Truth country with the addition of five new countries: Taiwan, Malaysia, Poland, Romania, and the last regions of Russia.

To build the map, we have to gather high-quality information; in the next post, we\u2019ll show you what that process looks like\u2014and show off a new mapping technology.

So we\u2019ve always believed that it should be meaningful\u2014not a daily grind, done in isolation on an old desktop in a sea of cubicles. Even more, we believe that technology should make work better. It should make it easy not just to get things done, but to get things done with people who inspire you, at the times and in the places where you work best, and in a way that lets you make an impact, no matter what your job is, or what industry you\u2019re in.<br />\n<br />\nTen years ago, we started bringing Google\u2019s consumer technology\u2014along with the features, controls and services businesses need\u2014to work. We first brought search and then Gmail to businesses. Today we also offer the scale and reliability of Google\u2019s infrastructure to developers with Google Maps and Google Cloud Platform, and have extended into hardware with Android and Chromebooks. Along the way we\u2019ve invested in what matters to our customers and partners\u2014security, transparency, compliance and customer support. And our team, the breadth of our offerings, and our commitment to business customers have all increased substantially. <br />\n<br />\nWork today is very different from 10 years ago. Cloud computing, once a new idea, is abundantly available, and collaboration is possible across offices, cities, countries and continents. Ideas can go from prototype to development to launch in a matter of days. Working from a computer, tablet or phone is no longer just a trend\u2014it\u2019s a reality. And millions of companies, large and small, have turned to Google\u2019s products to help them launch, build and transform their businesses, and help their employees work the way they live. In other words, work is already better than it used to be. <br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/bTFPSQ7Q0zw\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\nBut technology for the workplace isn't just about a better way of doing business. It's about empowering anyone, whether they're a developer with an idea in their basement or a baker with a better cupcake or a company with thousands of employees, to have an impact. We never set out to create a traditional \u201centerprise\u201d business\u2014we wanted to create a new way of doing work. So the time has come for our name to catch up with our ambition.

If Iselle makes landfall, she\u2019ll be the first hurricane to hit the Big Island since 1950. Julio, like the tag-a-long younger brother, is right on Iselle\u2019s tail. You can review tips on how to stay safe during hurricane season <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+google/posts/iGz3bdgEEtv\">here</a>.<br />\n<br />\nA Hawaiian hurricane isn\u2019t the only trouble brewing in the air. Searchers had a virtual panic attack when Facebook <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Facebook+down&amp;std=20140801&amp;pn=p1#a=20140801-Facebook+down\">went down</a> for a couple hours last Friday. In a state of shock, some people even <a href=\"http://time.com/3071049/facebook-down-police/\">called the police</a> to assist with their social media emergency. Meanwhile, a toxin called <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=microcystin&amp;std=20140802&amp;pn=p1#a=20140802-microcystin\">microcystin</a> is contaminating the waters in parts of Ohio, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to stockpile bottled water and look for answers on the Internet. <br />\n<br />\nBut there\u2019s only one thing that can distract us from the craziness of real life\u2026 and that\u2019s the sheer absurdity of reality TV. Viewers and searchers tuned in to watch the premiere of the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Bachelor+in+Paradise&amp;std=20140804&amp;pn=p1#a=20140804-Bachelor+in+Paradise\"><i>Bachelor in Paradise</i></a>, an elimination-style show where contestants compete for love. This is probably not what Cervantes meant when he wrote that all's fair in love and war. <br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mofwRGR_r4g/U-UdFBCLG2I/AAAAAAAAPCw/QvDcle0iJtQ/s1600/search_trends_shell.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mofwRGR_r4g/U-UdFBCLG2I/AAAAAAAAPCw/QvDcle0iJtQ/s1600/search_trends_shell.png\" height=\"400\" width=\"236\" /></a></div>\n<br />\n<b>First let me take a selfie</b><br />\nAs if the world couldn\u2019t get any more litigious, a British photographer is taking on Wikimedia over a selfie\u2014and not just any selfie, a monkey selfie. After a curious crested black macaque came upon David Slater\u2019s camera equipment and fulfilled nature\u2019s call by taking a <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/photographer-wikipedia-copyright-fight-viral-monkey-selfie-picture-article-1.1895459#OQXbRsICeM3oqQah.97\">selfie</a>, the photo went viral and was eventually uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, an online repository of free to use images, sound, and other media. Slater asked Wikimedia to take it down on copyright infringement grounds, and Wikimedia said no. Their argument: the photo wasn\u2019t Slater\u2019s work -- it was the monkey\u2019s. We\u2019ll leave it up to you to decide who you think is right.  <br />\n<br />\nFortunately, at least one dispute this week was resolved: The stars of the hit science geek themed show, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Big+Bang+Theory&amp;std=20140804&amp;pn=p1#a=20140804-Big+Bang+Theory\"><i>The Big Bang Theory</i></a>, signed new contracts that would pay them $1 million per episode. We\u2019re betting that somehow the line \u201cShow me the Money\u201d is going to make it into the script. A real-life scientist also managed to crack the trends charts when our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/john-venns-180th-birthday\">doodle</a> celebrating <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=John+Venn&amp;std=20140803&amp;pn=p1#a=20140803-John+Venn\">John Venn</a>, the creator of the Venn Diagram, got searchers excited to discover what the intersections between sea-life and something with wings. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ywG1_BfMQRM/U-UdTLxbxII/AAAAAAAAPC4/dZh7fFudrt4/s1600/john-venns-180th-birthday-5678550711533568.2-hp.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ywG1_BfMQRM/U-UdTLxbxII/AAAAAAAAPC4/dZh7fFudrt4/s1600/john-venns-180th-birthday-5678550711533568.2-hp.jpg\" height=\"147\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Who runs the world? Girls!</b><br />\nLet\u2019s be honest, can anyone really get enough Beyonce in their life? Her \u201cOn the Run\u201d tour with that other mildly successful artist/mogul just topped <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2014/08/06/jay-z-and-beyonces-ticket-sales-top-100-million-as-tour-winds-down/\">$100 million</a> in ticket sales and now the remix of her song \u201c<a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Flawless+Remix&amp;std=20140803&amp;pn=p1#a=20140803-Flawless+Remix\">Flawless</a>\u201d featuring Nicki Minaj is getting searchers into a frenzy. This woman can do no wrong (except <a href=\"http://blog.muchmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/beyoncepizza.jpg\">maybe</a>). <br />\n<br />\nBeyonce may cast a shadow that dwarfs us all, but two other women are holding their own on the search charts. WBNA star <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Becky+Hammon&amp;std=20140805&amp;pn=p1#a=20140805-Becky+Hammon\">Becky Hammon</a> became the NBA\u2019s first female assistant coach when she joined the staff of the San Antonio Spurs. (We\u2019ll call that a crack in the glass backboard.) And First Daughter Malia Obama nearly stole the show at <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Lollapalooza&amp;std=20140801&amp;pn=p1#a=20140801-Lollapalooza\">Lollapalooza</a> following her appearance among fellow festival-goers in Chicago. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Tip of the Week</b><br />\nTaking a hike is one of the best ways to enjoy the last days of summer. But it\u2019s always safer to hike in the daylight hours. Before you head out, remember to ask the Google App, \u201cWhen is sunset?\u201d to help you plan accordingly. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Jenise Araujo, Communications Associate, who searched for [reality tv is better than sitcoms] and [fomo].</span>", "id": "8965277674544455797", "updated": "2014-09-23T09:42:44-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["search", "search trends"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/8965277674544455797/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2014-08-08T12:00:00-07:00", "title": "Through the Google lens: search trends August 1-7"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/fifteen-ways-to-change-world-2014.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDA3MzM1NDAwNjI0Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/6595872150053885819", "content": "Kenneth Shinozuka, from New York City, wants to help people with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, like his grandfather.

When pressure is applied to the sensor, it alerts his family via a mobile app, which allows them to monitor when his grandfather is on the move. By monitoring this behavior, Kenneth hopes to understand the causes of <a href=\"http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-wandering.asp\">wandering</a> brought on by Alzheimer\u2019s, and to ultimately find a way to mitigate or prevent it. <br />\n<br />\nSamuel Burrow, from the U.K., wants to improve the environment by reducing pollution.

But from the start, email addresses have always required you to use non-accented Latin characters when signing up. Less than half of the world\u2019s population has a mother tongue that uses the Latin alphabet. And even fewer people use only the letters A-Z. So if your name (or that of your favorite pet) contains accented characters (like \u201cJos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n\u201d) or is written in another script like Chinese or Devanagari, your email address options are limited. <br />\n<br />\nBut all that could change. In 2012, an organization called the <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/\">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a> created a new email <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6530\">standard</a> that supports addresses with non-Latin and accented Latin characters (e.g. \u6b66\uff20\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb.\u30b0\u30fc\u30b0\u30eb). In order for this standard to become a reality, every email provider and every website that asks you for your email address must adopt it. That\u2019s obviously a tough hill to climb. The technology is there, but someone has to take the first step.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xXmBxXhsTAw/U-D8vT4OOdI/AAAAAAAAPCA/LZFK0uZkt74/s1600/internationalized_email_address.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xXmBxXhsTAw/U-D8vT4OOdI/AAAAAAAAPCA/LZFK0uZkt74/s1600/internationalized_email_address.png\" height=\"156\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\nToday we're ready to be that someone. Starting now, Gmail (and shortly, Calendar) will recognize addresses that contain accented or non-Latin characters. This means Gmail users can send emails to, and receive emails from, people who have these characters in their email addresses. Of course, this is just a first step and there\u2019s still a ways to go. In the future, we want to make it possible for you to use them to create Gmail accounts.<br />\n<br />\nLast month, we announced&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/07/thirteen-new-languages-for-gmail_7.html\">the addition of 13 new languages</a> in Gmail.

Rowling was in the news this week after she posted a new <i>Harry Potter</i> story to the fan site Pottermore.com. There were <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Pottermore&amp;std=20140708&amp;pn=p1#a=20140708-Pottermore\">more than 200,000 searches</a> for the site itself (an increase of more than 100 percent over 30 days), as people speculated about whether the new tale signified the coming of more stories about Harry, Hermione and the rest of Dumbledore\u2019s Army. Meanwhile, people turned to search to find the new trailer for another, very different book-turned-movie: the twisty, turny <i>Gone Girl</i>. Searches for [gone girl trailer] have nearly doubled in the last month.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cF2ApYKYuVE/U8Bqfas83mI/AAAAAAAAO4w/-TYuPmJagAo/s1600/Trends_Final.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cF2ApYKYuVE/U8Bqfas83mI/AAAAAAAAO4w/-TYuPmJagAo/s1600/Trends_Final.png\" height=\"600\" /></a></div><b>And baby makes three</b><br />\nThe Internet experienced a collective shock on Wednesday when news emerged that beloved actor/<a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/ryan-gosling\">meme</a> Ryan Gosling and girlfriend [<a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Eva+Mendes&amp;std=20140709&amp;pn=p1#a=20140709-Eva+Mendes\">eva mendes</a>] are expecting. (With apologies to <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/06/through-google-lens-search-trends-june.html\">Mila Kunis</a>.) Hundreds of thousands of people turned to search <strike>in denial</strike>, determined to find out the truth. Oddly enough, the phrase [ryan gosling father] had already <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=ryan%20gosling&amp;date=today%201-m&amp;cmpt=q\">spiked</a> in June, after a recent Father\u2019s Day hoax that claimed the Gos had previously adopted a child. And there\u2019s no doubt that many were fervently hoping this, too, was merely a rumor and that they still had a chance with His \u201cHey Girl\u201d-ness. Disappointed fans will have to console themselves by (re)watching <i>The Notebook</i>, which recently celebrated its 10th anniversary, and generated <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Rachel+McAdams&amp;std=20140702&amp;pn=p1#a=20140702-Rachel+McAdams\">a few searches of its own</a>. Oh, and congratulations to Ms. Mendes, too. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Summer snack time</b><br />\nFinally, during a week of Fourth of July barbecues, it\u2019s only fitting that there was an unusual number of food-related subjects among this week\u2019s trending topics, starting with a picnic table classic. Last week, a fellow named Zach Danger Brown set up a [<a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Kickstarter&amp;std=20140707&amp;pn=p1#a=20140707-Kickstarter\">kickstarter</a>] project to raise funds for\u2026 potato salad. Literally. Despite some controversy over its merits, fundraising for Zach\u2019s project is now $45,326\u2014and counting\u2014past the original $10 goal, and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=potato%20salad&amp;date=today%201-m&amp;cmpt=q\">searches for potato salad</a> were nearly as high on Tuesday as on Independence Day itself. But that\u2019s nothing compared to another Kickstarter project focused on a summer staple. With more than $1.5 million raised so far, the [<a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Coolest+Cooler&amp;std=20140709&amp;pn=p1#a=20140709-Coolest+Cooler\">coolest cooler</a>] promises not just to keep your drinks chilled (elementary, my dear Coleman), but also offers a bevy of bells and whistles worthy of \u201cPimp My Ride.\u201d Not only have 50,000+ searches been done on the subject, but the campaign is well on its way to Kickstarter records. Finally, [<a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Joey+Chestnut&amp;std=20140704&amp;pn=p1#a=20140704-Joey+Chestnut\">joey chestnut</a>] won hearts as well as the mustard winner\u2019s belt at this year\u2019s Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest at Coney Island when he proposed to his girlfriend at the event.

We're republishing the op-ed in full below. </i>-Ed.<br />\n<br />\nWhen you search online, there\u2019s an unwritten assumption that you\u2019ll get an instant answer, as well as additional information if you need to dig deeper.  This is all possible because of two decades worth of investment and innovation by many different companies.  Today, however, search engines across Europe face a new challenge\u2014one we\u2019ve had just two months to get our heads around.  That challenge is figuring out what information we must deliberately <i>omit</i> from our results, following a new ruling from the European Court of Justice.  <br />\n<br />\nIn the past we\u2019ve restricted the removals we make from search to a very short list.  It includes information deemed illegal by a court, such as defamation, pirated content (once we\u2019re notified by the rights holder), malware, personal information such as bank details, child sexual abuse imagery and other things prohibited by local law (like material that glorifies Nazism in Germany).  <br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve taken this approach because, as article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:  <i>\u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\"</i><br />\n<br />\nBut the European Court found that people have the right to ask for information to be removed from search results that include their names if it is \u201c<i>inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive.</i>\u201d In deciding what to remove, search engines must also have regard to the public interest. These are, of course, very vague and subjective tests.  The court also decided that search engines don\u2019t qualify for a \u201cjournalistic exception.\u201d This means that <i>The Guardian</i> could have an article on its website about an individual that\u2019s perfectly legal, but we might not legally be able to show links to it in our results when you search for that person\u2019s name.  It\u2019s a bit like saying the book can stay in the library, it just cannot be included in the library\u2019s card catalogue.   <br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s for these reasons that we disagree with the ruling.  That said, we obviously respect the court\u2019s authority and are doing our very best to comply quickly and responsibly.  It\u2019s a huge task as we\u2019ve had over 70,000 take-down requests covering 250,000 webpages since May.  So we now have a team of people individually reviewing each application, in most cases with limited information and almost no context.  <br />\n<br />\nThe examples we\u2019ve seen so far highlight the difficult value judgments search engines and European society now face:  former politicians wanting posts removed that criticize their policies in office; serious, violent criminals asking for articles about their crimes to be deleted; bad reviews for professionals like architects and teachers; comments that people have written themselves (and now regret).  In each case, someone wants the information hidden, while others might argue it should be out in the open. <br />\n<br />\nWhen it comes to determining what\u2019s in the the public interest, we\u2019re taking into account a number of factors.  These include whether:  the information relates to a politician, celebrity, or other public figure; if the material comes from a reputable news source, and how recent it is; whether it involves political speech; questions of professional conduct that might be relevant to consumers; the involvement of criminal convictions that are not yet \u201cspent\u201d; and if the information is being published by a government.  But these will always be difficult and debatable judgments. <br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re also doing our best to be transparent about removals: for example, we\u2019re informing websites when one of their pages has been removed.  But we cannot be specific about why we have removed the information because that could violate the individual\u2019s privacy rights under the court's decision.  <br />\n<br />\nOf course, only two months in, our process is still very much a work in progress.  It\u2019s why we incorrectly removed links to some articles last week (they have since been reinstated).  But the good news is that the ongoing, active debate that\u2019s happening will inform the development of our principles, policies and practices\u2014in particular about how to balance one person\u2019s right to privacy with another\u2019s right to know. <br />\n<br />\nThat\u2019s why we've also set up an <a href=\"http://www.google.com/advisorycouncil\">advisory council</a> of experts, the final membership of which we're announcing today. These external experts from the worlds of academia, the media, data protection, civil society and the tech sector are serving as independent advisors to Google.  The council will be asking for evidence and recommendations from different groups, and will hold public meetings this autumn across Europe to examine these issues more deeply.  Its public report will include recommendations for particularly difficult removal requests (like criminal convictions); thoughts on the implications of the court\u2019s decision for European Internet users, news publishers, search engines and others; and procedural steps that could improve accountability and transparency for websites and citizens.<br />\n<br />\nThe issues here at stake are important and difficult, but we\u2019re committed to complying with the court\u2019s decision. Indeed it's hard not to empathize with some of the requests we've seen\u2014from the man who asked that we not show a news article saying he had been questioned in connection with a crime (he\u2019s able to demonstrate that he was never charged) to the mother who requested that we remove news articles for her daughter\u2019s name as she had been the victim of abuse.  It\u2019s a complex issue, with no easy answers.   So a robust debate is both welcome and necessary, as, on this issue at least, no search engine has an instant or perfect answer.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by David Drummond, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Chief Legal Officer</span>", "id": "674270406420166543", "updated": "2014-07-11T07:30:05-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/674270406420166543/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2014-07-11T06:40:00-07:00", "title": "Searching for the right balance"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/07/google-cloud-platform-predicts-world.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDA1MDg1MDY1NjI3Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/5723922835252835686", "content": "In 2010, we had <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Octopus\">Paul the Octopus</a>.

We\u2019re giving you the keys to our prediction model so you can make your own model and run your own predictions. <br />\n<br />\n<b>A little background</b><br />\nUsing data from <a href=\"http://www.optasports.com/\">Opta</a> covering multiple seasons of professional soccer leagues as well as the group stage of the World Cup, we were able to examine how activity in previous games predicted performance in subsequent ones. We combined this modeling with a power ranking of relative team strength developed by one of our engineers, as well as a metric to stand in for hometeam advantage based on fan enthusiasm and the number of fans who had traveled to Brazil. We used a whole bunch of Google Cloud Platform products to build this model, including <a href=\"http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2014/06/sneak-peek-google-cloud-dataflow-a-cloud-native-data-processing-service.html\">Google Cloud Dataflow</a> to import all the data and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/bigquery\">Google BigQuery</a> to analyze it. So far, we\u2019ve only been wrong on one match (we underestimated Germany when they faced France in the quarterfinals). <br />\n<br />\nWatch <a class=\"g-profile\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/115600841849663767233\" target=\"_blank\">+Jordan Tigani</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/felipehoffa\">Felipe Hoffa</a> from the BigQuery team talk about the project in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyvvxFeADh8\">this video from Google I/O</a>, or look at our <a href=\"http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2014/07/google-cloud-platform-goes-8-for-8-in-soccer-predictions.html\">quarterfinals</a> and <a href=\"http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2014/07/google-cloud-platform-is-11-for-12-in-World-Cup-predictions.html\">semifinals</a> blog posts to learn more. <br />\n<br />\n<b>A narrow win for Germany in the final</b><br />\nDrumroll please\u2026 Though we think it\u2019s going to be close, Germany has the edge: our model gives them a 55 percent chance of defeating Argentina. Both teams have had excellent tournaments so far, but the model favors Germany for a number of factors. Thus far in the tournament, they\u2019ve had better passing in the attacking half of their field, a higher number of shots (64 vs. 61) and a higher number of goals scored (17 vs. 8). <br />\n<br />\n(Oh, and we think Brazil has a tiny advantage in the third place game. They may have had a disappointing defeat on Tuesday, but their numbers still look good.)<br />\n<br />\n<b>Channel your inner data nerd</b><br />\nNow it\u2019s your turn. We\u2019ve put together a step-by-step guide (warning: code ahead) showing how we built our model and used it for predictions. You could try different statistical techniques or adding in your own data, like player salaries or team travel distance. Even though we\u2019ve been right 92.86 percent of the time, we\u2019re sure there\u2019s room for improvement. <br />\n<br />\nThe model works for other hypothetical situations, and it includes data going back to the 2006 World Cup, three years of English Barclays Premier League, two seasons of Spanish La Liga, and two seasons of U.S. MLS. So, you could try modeling how the USA would have done against Argentina if their game against Belgium had gone differently, or pit this year\u2019s German team against the unstoppable Spanish team of 2010. The world (er, dataset) is your oyster.<br />\n<br />\nReady to kick things off?

This year, we doubled GoogleServe from one to two weeks so we could involve more volunteers and serve more community organizations. And it paid off\u2014more than 12,000 Googlers from 70+ offices participated in 800+ projects, making this our biggest GoogleServe to date. Here\u2019s a look at how we gave back to our communities this year:<br />\n<br />\n<b>Making tech more accessible</b><br />\nAt our Mountain View headquarters and in Hyderabad, India, Googlers volunteered in three <a href=\"http://www.socialcoding4good.org/\">SocialCoding4Good</a> events. Googlers participated in an Accessibility Code Sprint with <a href=\"http://benetech.org/\">Benetech's Global Literacy Program</a> to improve <a href=\"http://goread.org/\">Go Read</a>, a free mobile app for people with visual impairments and reading disabilities. A team of Googlers also worked with <a href=\"https://www.bookshare.org/\">Bookshare</a> to write descriptions for nearly 1,400 images in five STEM textbooks, making charts, graphs, and diagrams more accessible to blind and visually impaired students.  <br />\n<br />\n<b>Helping veterans build their resumes </b><br />\nGooglers helped 475 veterans build their resumes as part of our \u201cHelp a Hero Get Hired\u201d workshops in 14 cities: Ann Arbor, Atlanta, Austin, Boulder, Cambridge, Chicago, Kansas City, Moncks Corner, Mountain View, New York City, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. This was our fourth year partnering with <a href=\"http://www.studentveterans.org/\">Student Veterans of America</a> to help veterans take the next steps in their careers.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Volunteering at local schools and community centers</b><br />\nIn Oakland, volunteers canvassed the community with <a href=\"http://www.hackthehood.org/\">Hack the Hood</a>, a <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/06/meet-bay-area-impact-challenge-winners.html\">Bay Area Impact Challenge winner</a> that trains youth from Oakland's low-income communities to build mobile-friendly websites. In San Francisco, Googlers visited the <a href=\"http://www.ymcasf.org/presidio/\">Presidio YMCA</a>, where they repaired picnic tables, cleaned toys and organized closets, and worked with the YMCA\u2019s marketing specialists to redesign their corporate partnerships materials. In Kampala, Uganda, Googlers painted a nursery at <a href=\"http://www.sanyubabies.com/\">Sanyu Babies\u2019 Home</a>, helping brighten the living space of the Home\u2019s young residents.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Building houses and preparing meals</b><br />\nGooglers in Mexico City, Buenos Aires and Valparaiso, Chile, partnered with <a href=\"http://www.techo.org/en/\">Techo</a> to build houses for low-income families, while volunteers in Singapore prepared, cooked, and distributed 3,000 meals at <a href=\"http://www.willinghearts.org.sg/\">Willing Hearts Soup Kitchen</a>. In Milan and Mountain View, Googlers packaged 16,500 meals with <a href=\"http://www.stophungernow.org/\">Stop Hunger Now</a>, a nonprofit that ships food to schools, orphanages and clinics in more than 70 countries.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Protecting the environment </b><br />\nA group of Googlers in Auckland, New Zealand, cleared three kilometers of coastline at <a href=\"http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/parksfacilities/walkingtracks/Pages/tahunatoreawalkingtrails.aspx\">Tahuna Torea Nature Reserve</a>, and Ann Arbor Googlers collected trash as they paddled down the Huron River with the <a href=\"http://www.hrwc.org/\">Huron River Watershed Council</a>.

These marvels from the past still influence our lives today, and are tangible examples of how fearless exploration and entrepreneurship can literally change the world. <br />\n<br />\nTo help support the next generation of European entrepreneurs, today <a href=\"http://www.gv.com/\">Google Ventures</a> is launching a new venture fund, with initial funding of $100 million.

Startups need more than just capital to succeed: they also benefit from engineering support, design expertise, and guidance with recruiting, marketing and product management. Five years later, we\u2019re working with <a href=\"https://www.gv.com/portfolio/\">more than 250 portfolio companies</a>, tackling challenges across a host of industries. For example, the team at <a href=\"http://www.flatiron.com/\">Flatiron Health</a> is improving the way doctors and patients approach cancer care, <a href=\"http://www.synapdx.com/\">SynapDx</a> is developing a blood test for the early detection of Autism in children, and <a href=\"http://www.cleanpowerfinance.com/\">Clean Power Finance</a> is making solar energy affordable for homeowners. <br />\n<br />\nWe believe Europe\u2019s startup scene has enormous potential.

The <b>Hearing and Speech Agency</b> will use Glass to pilot new ways to improve communication access for people who have speech language challenges, hearing loss and autism\u2014and support those who teach and care for them. And the <b>Mark Morris Dance Group</b> will create a Glass app that will build on their award-winning <a href=\"http://danceforparkinsons.org/\">Dance for PD\u00ae</a> initiative to help people with Parkinson\u2019s disease remember and trigger body movements in their daily lives. <br />\n<br />\nFinally, Glass will head across the U.S. by bicycle to help raise money and increase awareness for brain cancer research. For the first time, supporters of participants in the <b>3000 Miles to a Cure Race</b> Across America will be able to see and experience it through a racer\u2019s eyes and the racer will be alerted to every message of encouragement and donation supporters send.<br />\n<br />\nDevelopers are already working with these inspiring groups, and next week these five nonprofits will descend on Google Glass' Base Camp in San Francisco for training, and to connect with their Google mentors.

Building on 2 million past participants, Maker Camp 2014 officially kicks off today at 11 a.m. PDT / 2 p.m. EDT today with a <a href=\"http://goo.gl/ymlFPJ\">Hangout</a> featuring NASA and Buzz Aldrin. -</i>Ed.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve always believed that everyone, especially young people, should be able to feel the joy that comes from imagining and creating something that didn\u2019t exist before.<br />\n<br />\nNine years ago, we hosted our very first Bay Area Maker Faire, an all-ages gathering of tech enthusiasts, crafters, hobbyists and artists. The event was partly inspired by the idea that the special creative energy produced by kids is even stronger when they\u2019re brought together. Since that first get-together, it has grown globally with more than 100 events in places like Tokyo, Rome, Santiago and Oslo. Recently, a man in Atlanta told me that \u201cmaking\u201d changed his son\u2019s life\u2014by inspiring self-confidence through the joys of engineering, design and music. And just last weekend, a family drove eight hours to reach a Maker Faire because their 14-year-old son, Daniel, was so excited about meeting other makers.  <br />\n<br />\nBut eight hours is a long way to drive to connect with other creative kids. So to make sure that inspiration and community are more accessible to young makers\u2014no matter where they are\u2014we teamed up with Google to create <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+MAKE/posts\">Maker Camp</a>, now back for its third summer. Through Google+, Maker Camp connects young makers from across the globe as they create, invent and build projects like <a href=\"http://makezine.com/projects/soda-bottle-rocket-led-fireworks/\">soda bottle rocket fireworks</a>, <a href=\"http://makezine.com/projects/make-38-cameras-and-av/glow-bike/\">glowing bikes</a>, and <a href=\"http://makezine.com/projects/led-shoe-clips/\">LED shoe clips</a> (our version of arts and crafts).

With the Barbican, we commissioned three interactive artists to create pieces for Digital Revolution. <a href=\"https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/16501507\">Karsten Schmidt</a>\u2019s <b>Co(de) Factory</b> empowers anyone to be an artist with an online design tool that creates 3D digital sculptures that may be showcased in the exhibition. <a href=\"https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/15870625\">Zach Lieberman</a>\u2019s <b>Play the World </b>uses code to find musical notes from hundreds of live radio stations around the world. When a visitor plays the piano at the centre of the piece, each note is precisely matched to one of those radio sounds, and played back via 360-degree speakers to create a uniquely global piece of music. And duo <a href=\"https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/16494767\">Varvara Guljajeva and Mar Canet</a>\u2019s <b>Wishing Wall</b> lets you whisper a wish, see your words projected in front of you, then transformed into a butterfly that (virtually) lands on your hand. <br />\n<br />\nWe also put out a <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/devart-art-made-with-code.html\">global call</a> to undiscovered interactive artists for the opportunity to be commissioned by Google and Barbican, and exhibited alongside the DevArt artists. There were hundreds of entries, including a giant map (using Google Maps API) where <a href=\"https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/16566495?t=finalist\">children can explore fantasy and reality</a>, a <a href=\"https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/16589129?t=finalist\">group-play haptic musical instrument</a> that visualizes sound using Android, and <a href=\"https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/17440244\">maps of dreams</a> as they move through the brain (using Google+ APIs).  In the end, the DevArt judges chose <b>Les M\u00e9tamorphoses de Mr. Kalia</b>, by Cyril Diagne and Beatrice Lartigue, which allows you to use your body's movements to control a larger-than-life animated character, transforming basic movement into a powerful visual performance. <br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tyDU6NjcUmk/U7T6wdaynkI/AAAAAAAAO1c/FKkIFXNeFJs/s1600/DevArt+Blog+images.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tyDU6NjcUmk/U7T6wdaynkI/AAAAAAAAO1c/FKkIFXNeFJs/s400/DevArt+Blog+images.png\" /></a><br />\n<i>(Photos - Andrew Meredith)</i></div>\n<br />\nWe want to inspire a new generation of coders and artists to see what they can create with technology as their canvas.

Topping longtime rival Lionel Messi and rising icon Neymar, Ronaldo proves all you need to win in search is serious dribbling skills, a chiseled jawline and a unique haircut (although the reason behind his hairstyle may be pretty <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/worldcup/cristiano-ronaldo-haircut-did-portugal-star-zigzag-his-hair-in-tribute-to-erik-ortiz-cruz-9556333.html\">heartwarming</a> \u2026 if true). <br />\n<br />\n<b>Look ma\u2014no hands!</b><br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-atFPb9LQOAY/U627ZQD_rOI/AAAAAAAAOzg/lQ72--RfXZA/s1600/shot.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-atFPb9LQOAY/U627ZQD_rOI/AAAAAAAAOzg/lQ72--RfXZA/s1600/shot.jpg\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\nA World Cup is only as good as its <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_spot/2014/06/27/_2014_world_cup_goals_watch_all_136_goals_from_the_group_stage_video.html\">goals</a>\u2014and we\u2019ve seen a couple of doozies this time around. Robin Van Persie\u2019s leaping header made him an overnight <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/06/16/van-persie-header-goal-meme/\">Internet</a> sensation, while people were excited to see that Messi got his groove back after scoring his first World Cup goal in eight years. And if you blinked, you might have missed Clint Dempsey\u2019s goal in the U.S.A\u2019s 2-1 victory over Ghana. Clocking in at 32 seconds after the start of the match, Dempsey scored the fastest American goal in World Cup history. That feat, however, couldn\u2019t save the United States as they fell victim to the latest goal in World Cup history off the head of Silvestre Varela.<br />\n<br />\n<b>A pitched battle</b><br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U8Az_6DWgdg/U627e7zOS2I/AAAAAAAAOzo/ZBnbIdDw5Gw/s1600/battles.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U8Az_6DWgdg/U627e7zOS2I/AAAAAAAAOzo/ZBnbIdDw5Gw/s1600/battles.jpg\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\nDo you take your fish and chips with pasta? Searchers were eager to watch England and Italy\u2019s clash for Group D dominance (spoiler alert: both teams got the boot) while the U.S.A.\u2019s match against Ghana took second place in search. Rounding out the top three, we\u2019re pretty sure Guillermo Ochoa\u2019s stellar performance and totally convincing impression of a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/espn/status/479004917420785664/photo/1\">wall</a> was what made the Brazil vs. Mexico match a hot one.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Time to bust a move</b><br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uJhu2L08GuA/U627UvlJ_yI/AAAAAAAAOzY/65kapVifMx8/s1600/dancing.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uJhu2L08GuA/U627UvlJ_yI/AAAAAAAAOzY/65kapVifMx8/s1600/dancing.jpg\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\nIt was a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dance+off\">dance-off</a> on the trends charts as Daniel Sturridge's wave won over the crowd ahead of Neymar\u2019s funky jig. But our personal favorite has to be the Ghanaian national team\u2019s collaborative routine after star striker Asamoah Gyan scored a goal to take the lead in their match against Germany.

The crowd in San Francisco was joined by millions more watching on the livestream and 597 I/O Extended events, in 90+ countries on six continents.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re meeting at an exciting time for Google, and for our developer community. There are now one billion of you around the world who use an Android device. One billion. We estimate that\u2019s more than 20 billion text messages sent every day. 1.5 trillion steps taken with an Android. And more importantly, a roughly estimated 93M selfies.<br />\n<br />\nToday, developers got a preview of our most ambitious Android release yet. With more than 5,000 new APIs (for non-techies, that stands for application programming interfaces) and a new, consistent design approach called <a href=\"http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2014/06/this-is-material-design.html\">material design</a>, we\u2019re continuing to evolve the Android platform so developers can bring to life even more beautiful, engaging mobile experiences. <br />\n<br />\nBut, beyond the mobile phone, many of us are increasingly surrounded by a range of screens throughout the day--at home, at work, in the car, or even on our wrist. So, we got to thinking: how do we invest more in our two popular, open platforms\u2014Android and Chrome\u2014to make it easier for you to easily and intuitively move from your phone, tablet, laptop to your TV, car or even your watch?<br />\n<br />\nThat question was answered for the I/O crowd today. Here are some highlights:<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img height=\"155\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/y5iP-0G7IEDdqR2W-vkbScKCDiJo_6oa5cJ-iEMAJn6Xh7euYJQwMIAEliaoGwnrOSW-w89iPVUXpmf-f0zP7li81omfqU8fPFwgK4m9m0AUDRmjltujgub4BMm6HGFtmg\" width=\"640\" /></div>\n<b>On the go: Android Wear and Android Auto</b><br />\nMost people check their phones more than 150 times a day. Often, it\u2019s to read a text, look at a notification, or get some other simple piece of information. That\u2019s a lot of time spent unlocking, swiping and entering passwords, when your hands could easily be free handling more important things. <br />\n<br />\nEnter <a href=\"http://www.android.com/wear\">Android Wear</a>, which extends Android, and its ecosystem of apps, to that most familiar spot for a \u201cwearable,\u201d your wrist. You get the information you need, quickly at a glance\u2014just like you\u2019re used to doing with your watch. Just say \u201cOk Google\u201d to ask questions or to get stuff done. Get alerted when it's time to leave for dinner. Call a cab to take you there. See the traffic on the way. Text a friend once you're seated. It\u2019s all right there, on your wrist, easy to see, right when you want it. Today we announced that two Android wearables, the LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live, are available to order today on Google Play, and the Moto 360 from Motorola will be available in the coming months. Your thumbs will thank you.  <br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s one thing to be able to simply check your wrist for what you need when you\u2019re on the go. But what about when you\u2019re in your car? Many of us want to stay connected even while driving. Getting directions, traffic updates, finding just the right music playlist. But using our phones while at the wheel is simply unsafe. <br />\n<br />\nAndroid Auto, which we <a href=\"http://youtu.be/Ht8yzpIV9M0\">showed</a> to developers today, takes care of that for you. Just connect your Android phone to a car with Android Auto, and you\u2019ll have what you need at your fingertips such as turn-by-turn navigation from Google Maps, your curated playlists and radio stations through Play Music, simple-to-use voice search, and reminders from Google Now. This is accessible through your car\u2019s controls, and more importantly, is far safer than fumbling around with your phone. You\u2019ll start to see Android Auto in cars later this year.<br />\n<br />\n<b>In the living room: Chromecast and Android TV</b><br />\nSo, you get out of your car, and now you\u2019re home, after a long day, in front of the TV. Last summer, we launched Chromecast, a small, affordable device that lets you cast online video, music and anything from the web to your TV. It\u2019s getting an update to make it even more powerful, and convenient to use, with new features like the ability to allow others to cast to your TV without needing to be on the same WiFi network, a customizable homescreen with personal photos or beautiful art, and casting exactly what is on your Android phone or tablet screen directly to the TV.<br />\n<br />\nNow, in addition to Chromecast, <a href=\"http://www.android.com/tv\">Android TV</a> brings all that you love about Android apps and games to your living room. Android is baked directly into your TV-watching experience, through a set-top box or as part of your TV. You can use voice search to find a live TV show, a good flick from Google Play, or a music video on YouTube. Plus, because it\u2019s Android, you\u2019ll be able to play your favorite Android games, reimagined for TV and with a gamepad. Android TV, which, like Chromecast, supports Google Cast technology, will ship with products from a range of consumer electronics companies later this year. <br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/d36cIFCJvQs\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br /></div>\n<b>For the next billion: Android One</b><br />\nAll these amazing multi-screen experiences are built around a smartphone and basic internet connectivity. However, there are many people\u2014billions of people, in fact\u2014who still don\u2019t have access to a smartphone. We want to change that; so today we announced an important initiative called Android One. <br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re working with partners on a comprehensive solution\u2014which includes hardware reference platforms\u2014to address the mobile computing needs of those in emerging markets. Android One will provide smartphones that are high quality, affordable and come with reasonable data plans. Our partners will launch an initial range of sub-$100 Android One smartphones starting in India this Fall, with more countries to follow. We\u2019ve long wondered what potential could be unleashed if people everywhere had access to the latest technology and the world's information. It's time to find out.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Design, Develop, Distribute</b><br />\nAll in all, Android and Chrome are the platforms that make these experiences possible, but the products developers build upon them are what make it all come alive. Google I/O allows us to show them what we\u2019re up to\u2014whether it\u2019s a new approach to design, new developer tools, or new ways to reach the next billion people who come online. <br />\n<br />\nFor all you developers out there, thanks for everything you do.

They couldn\u2019t do what they do without having learned not just to use technology, but to build it themselves. Unfortunately, there are far too few women like them and far too few young girls following their paths. In fact, fewer than <a href=\"http://www.aauw.org/files/2013/02/Why-So-Few-Women-in-Science-Technology-Engineering-and-Mathematics.pdf\">one percent</a> of high school girls express interest in majoring in computer science. <br />\n<br />\nThis is an issue that hits home for me. My school-age daughter instinctively knows how to play games, watch videos and chat with friends online. She understands technology. And she likes using technology.  But, she never expressed any interest in creating it herself.  <br />\n<br />\nSo, I decided to launch a campaign at home \u2014 connecting my daughter to coding resources, increasing my encouragement and introducing her to other girls interested in computer science. It wasn\u2019t always easy, but it\u2019s already showing results.

An important Middle Eastern city in ancient times, it\u2019s now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With its fortified walls, citadel, mosques, synagogues, khans, baths and Crusader structures, Acre has always been a meeting place for East and West, new and old. Today, it\u2019s a mixed Jewish-Arab city, but people from the two communities interact all too rarely. Mistrust, and sometimes outright hostility, keep the two communities apart.<br />\n<br />\nWe wanted to see if the Internet could help break down some of these barriers. So last September, a group of 40 students from the separate Arab and Jewish schools in the city, together with 200 Arab, Jewish, Druze and Bedouin students from other communities in Israel, took part in \u201c<a href=\"http://hangout-bridges.com/\">Hangout Bridges: Bridges to Peace</a>.\u201d A partnership with <a href=\"http://en.ort.org.il/352/\">ORT</a>, Israel\u2019s largest educational network of schools and colleges, and the <a href=\"http://www.peres-center.org/who_we_are\">Peres Center for Peace</a>, the program uses <a href=\"http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/\">Hangouts</a> to help create understanding\u2014and friendship\u2014between these communities. <br />\n<br />\nGrouped together by their teachers into multi-cultural Google+ circles, the students got to know each other online and started working on joint projects. Each circle met on average 10 times on Hangouts, then in a series of face-to-face meetings.<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/xw28_Vepd1U\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\nLast week, we hosted the finale event of the program at <a href=\"https://www.campustelaviv.com/\">Campus Tel Aviv</a>, a tech hub for developers and entrepreneurs at our Tel Aviv office. The students and their teachers enjoyed a creative session with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hQR8iaJIbU\">System Ali</a>, a multicultural rap group, and an inspirational talk with the leaders of <a href=\"http://meet.mit.edu/\">MEET</a>, an educational initiative that brings together young Israeli and Palestinian leaders. The students then presented the projects they've been working on for the last eight months, including a <a href=\"http://hangout-bridges.com/project/2014-2/heritage-trail-in-akko/\">walking tour of Acre</a> using Google Maps that seeks to uncover the rich Jewish-Arab history of this ancient city; <a href=\"http://hangout-bridges.com/project/2014-2/surfing-for-peace/\">educational Hebrew-Arabic websites</a> that address racism and prejudice in sports, provide information on relevant legislation and offer quizzes on the topic; and an <a href=\"http://hangout-bridges.com/project/2014-2/together-we-can-reach-the-sun/\">original song performed in Hebrew, Arabic and English</a>, emphasizing coexistence and mutual respect. <br />\n<br />\nThis is the second year we\u2019ve run \u201cHangout Bridges\u201d in Israel.

In her new role as animator and film director, the ever detail-oriented Audrey made sure that each light would flicker and that the water was clean enough to (virtually) drink in.

But a lot could happen to that letter on its way from you to her, and prying eyes might try to take a look. That\u2019s why we send important messages in sealed envelopes, rather than on postcards.<br />\n<br />\nEmail works in a similar way. Emails that are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption\">encrypted</a> as they\u2019re routed from sender to receiver are like sealed envelopes, and less vulnerable to snooping\u2014whether by bad actors or through government surveillance\u2014than postcards.<br />\n<br />\nBut some email is more secure than others. So to help you better understand whether your emails are protected by encryption, we\u2019re launching a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/saferemail/\">new section</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport\">Transparency Report</a>.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/saferemail/\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ag0SCDLpSY8/U44eFCbwxII/AAAAAAAAOoY/G6posm-7h6o/s640/Screen+Shot+2014-06-03+at+11.15.23+AM.png\" /></a></div>\nGmail has always supported encryption in transit by using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security\">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS), and will <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/03/staying-at-forefront-of-email-security.html\">automatically encrypt</a> your incoming and outgoing emails if it can. The important thing is that <i>both</i> sides of an email exchange need to support encryption for it to work; Gmail can't do it alone.<br />\n<br />\nOur data show that approximately 40 to 50 percent of emails sent between Gmail and other email providers aren\u2019t encrypted. Many providers have turned on encryption, and others have said they\u2019re going to, which is great news. As they do, more and more emails will be shielded from snooping.<br />\n<br />\nFor people looking for even stronger email security, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption\">end-to-end encryption</a> is a good option\u2014but it\u2019s been hard to use.

More than 30 years after it first premiered, the beloved PBS show \u201cReading Rainbow\u201d was in the news this week when former host LeVar Burton formed a Kickstarter campaign to fund a Reading Rainbow literacy program. In less than 24 hours, Burton had met his goal of a million dollars. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Sporting surprises</b><br />\nThe NBA and NHL playoffs continue to dominate sports fans' minds, but this week in addition to the more expected [rangers], [blackhawks], [heat], [spurs], etc. there were a few less common sporting searches. Rapper 50 Cent threw out a first pitch for the Mets on Tuesday, and it was a little, um, off the mark. People headed to Google to look for video and GIFs of the wild pitch. Some might say 50 Cent may want to stay in da club and off the mound.<br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile in tennis, French Open number-one seed Serena Williams was defeated by a lower-ranked young player, Garbine Muguruza, who grew up idolizing Serena\u2019s game. Finally, anticipation for summer soccer is heating up. Late last week we learned that player Landon Donovan would not be included in the United States\u2019 World Cup roster this year.

Other celebrations took place this weekend too: amidst a host of college students walking across the dais this weekend, there was one grad who's more known for her prowess in a fictional school. Harry Potter star Emma Watson graduated from Brown University (the Hogwarts of Rhode Island) this weekend, and searches for the actress were even higher than when she presented at the Oscars (woo, education!). But no weekend wrapup would be complete without at least a mention of... yes, Kimye.

Luckily, the storm was still a few miles off, so he was able to find an alternate route to the airport and make it home safely. <br />\n<br />\nEasy and timely access to information can make a huge difference in times of crisis\u2014whether to help people like Vivek get out of harm\u2019s way, or to help those affected after a disaster has occurred. The web can help by providing access to official alerts from government organizations, news reports and on-the-ground updates from social media. The key is making sure that all that information can get to those who are affected\u2014as quickly as possible. <br />\n<br />\nThat\u2019s one of the things our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/\">Crisis Response Team</a> focuses on. Since 2010, we\u2019ve been working to make disaster-related information immediately available and useful in a crisis, through tools like <a href=\"http://www.google.org/publicalerts/\">Public Alerts</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.org/crisismap\">Crisis Map</a> and <a href=\"http://google.org/personfinder/\">Person Finder</a>. And since next week marks the start of hurricane season in the North Atlantic, we thought we\u2019d provide a few tips to help you prepare for potential summer disasters\u2014from tropical storms to wildfires to floods. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Make sure you\u2019ll receive Public Alerts</b><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.google.org/crisisresponse/publicalerts/\">Google Public Alerts</a>, launched two years ago, is a tool that sends people alerts from authoritative sources like the U.S. National Weather Service or the Japan Meteorological Agency during emergencies. They\u2019re accessible through the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/landing/now/#howtogetit\">Google search app on your mobile devices</a> and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/landing/now/#getitchrome\">Google Chrome on your computer</a>, as well as in search results for related queries and on Google Maps when relevant.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LgKHLmgaUyU/U4jX3EUAZNI/AAAAAAAAOm4/cqExaW-4-WY/s1600/alert_tablet.png-large.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LgKHLmgaUyU/U4jX3EUAZNI/AAAAAAAAOm4/cqExaW-4-WY/s1600/alert_tablet.png-large.png\" /></a></div>\nPeople have used Public Alerts to get to safety before a <a href=\"http://www.google.org/publicalerts/alert?aid=7771f3c99aed6017\">landslide in Colombia</a>, set up sandbags before a <a href=\"http://www.google.org/publicalerts/alert?aid=dc483a6288e7478\">thunderstorm in Utah</a>, and get off the road before an <a href=\"http://www.google.org/publicalerts/alert?aid=c4a053595ff368e9\">ice storm in Kentucky</a>. To make sure you get the information you need to know when you need it, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/landing/now/#howtogetit\">get Google Now</a> on your Android device, iOS device, or computer.<br />\n<br />\nPublic Alerts are now available in seven countries (U.S., Australia, Canada, Colombia, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan) and will continue to roll out to new countries this year. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Install emergency preparedness apps</b><br />\nThere are a number of great apps which can help you prepare for or outlast an emergency. For example, a <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=flashlight&amp;c=apps\">flashlight app</a> can be useful if the power goes out and you don\u2019t have access to a regular flashlight (use a regular flashlight if you can to conserve your phone\u2019s battery). The <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org/prepare/mobile-apps\">first-aid and disaster preparedness apps from the Red Cross</a> have a lot of valuable information. And the official <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.fema.mobile.android\">FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) app</a> has information on how to stay safe during a disaster, the locations of FEMA disaster recovery stations, and more. <br />\n<br />\nAnd remember, when bad weather is on the way, keep your phone plugged in and follow this <a href=\"https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2819525?hl=en\">advice</a> to conserve battery life on Android. If you\u2019re using an iOS device, try <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/batteries/iphone.html\">these tips</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Get helpful gadgets</b><br />\nA <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=waterproof+phone+case&amp;es_sm=119&amp;tbm=shop&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lhxgU6qqOYegyATm44DwAQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1288&amp;bih=632&amp;dpr=1.1\">waterproof phone case</a> can help protect your phone during floods or heavy rains and a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=waterproof+phone+case&amp;es_sm=119&amp;tbm=shop&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lhxgU6qqOYegyATm44DwAQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1288&amp;bih=632&amp;dpr=1.1#q=solar+phone+charger&amp;tbm=shop\">portable solar-powered charger</a> will help keep your phone\u2019s battery alive. It may also be a good idea to invest in a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?tbm=shop&amp;q=solar+powered+charger#q=cell+phone+signal+booster&amp;tbm=shop\">cell phone signal booster</a> which gives you a greater chance of connecting to an operational cell tower. <br />\n<br />\nOf course, tech can only take you so far, so make sure you have the basics (like a <a href=\"http://www.ready.gov/build-a-kit\">disaster supplies kit</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan\">family emergency plan</a>) covered too\u2014<a href=\"http://ready.gov/\">Ready.gov</a> is a great resource. <br />\n<br />\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to predict the weather, we hope these tips help you and your family prepare for the possibility of things going wrong.

It\u2019s been thrilling to see how some schools take \u201c<a href=\"http://www.google.com/edu/\">going Google</a>\u201d to the next level and into their own hands\u2014coming up with even more creative ways of incorporating technology in education. Recently we came across one of these schools: <a href=\"http://colegiomaterdei.net/\">Col\u00e9gio Mater Dei in Brazil</a>. <br />\n<br />\nIn 2013, Mater Dei deployed Google Apps for Education as part of a move to incorporate technology into the academic environment. After they started to see early results, they came to Google with a plan: create a space on campus that\u2019s designed from the ground up to be a technology-powered learning center for K-12 students. Last week, that idea became a reality when Mater Dei launched what we\u2019re now calling the Google Learning Space. <br />\n<br />\nTransforming a part of their campus that used to be a traditional library, the school set up a high-performance wireless network in a room full of bright, colorful cushions and chairs where students can brainstorm, meet to discuss projects and talk with their teachers. There are two smart TVs with Chromecast installed, so students can project assignments, presentations and videos easily.

And so far, the results seem to be good\u2014the school is already experimenting with new ways to teach and learn. For example, kindergarten teachers are helping students \u201cvisit\u201d countries around the world with Google Earth and the Cultural Institute. Electronics teacher Andre Godoy is using Google Sites and Google Glass to help his students build a formula that can move a robot with a swipe of the finger. And biology teachers have started using the Google Play app Biodigital Human to help bring anatomy to life in 3D; students can add, remove and manipulate each organ of the body using the app, gaining an understanding of various diseases and how treatments are developed. Best of all, students and teachers seem more energized and excited to participate in class.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p0lyKc_ylvA/U4eF5xKsGbI/AAAAAAAAOmg/vRBDIJIjZPQ/s1600/grade+school.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p0lyKc_ylvA/U4eF5xKsGbI/AAAAAAAAOmg/vRBDIJIjZPQ/s1600/grade+school.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>Grade school students work with interactive biology apps from the Google Play Store</i></div>\n<br />\nThe Google Learning Space is just one example of how bringing technology into the classroom can have a real and immediate impact on both teachers and students.

For example, women <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_349.asp\">earn roughly 18 percent</a> of all computer science degrees in the United States. Blacks and Hispanics each make up <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/c2/c2s3.htm\">under 10 percent of U.S. college grads</a> and each collect fewer than 10 percent of degrees in CS majors. So we\u2019ve invested a lot of time and energy in education.<br />\n<br />\nAmong other things, since 2010 we\u2019ve given more than $40 million to organizations working to bring computer science education to women and girls. And we\u2019ve been working with historically black colleges and universities to elevate coursework and attendance in computer science. For example, this year Google engineer Charles Pratt was in-residence at Howard University, where he revamped the school\u2019s Intro to CS curriculum. <br />\n<br />\nBut we\u2019re the first to admit that Google is miles from where we want to be\u2014and that being totally clear about the extent of the problem is a really important part of the solution.

For over a decade we\u2019ve been <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/\">designing and building data centers</a> that use half the energy of a typical data center, and we\u2019re always looking for ways to reduce our energy use even further. In our pursuit of extreme efficiency, we\u2019ve hit upon a new tool: machine learning. Today we\u2019re releasing a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/viewer?url=www.google.com/about/datacenters/efficiency/internal/assets/machine-learning-applicationsfor-datacenter-optimization-finalv2.pdf\">white paper</a>&nbsp;(PDF) on how we\u2019re using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network\">neural networks</a> to optimize data center operations and drive our energy use to new lows. <br />\n<br />\nIt all started as a 20 percent project, a Google tradition of carving out time for work that falls outside of one\u2019s official job description. Jim Gao, an engineer on our data center team, is well-acquainted with the operational data we gather daily in the course of running our data centers. We calculate <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/efficiency/internal/\">PUE</a>, a measure of energy efficiency, every 30 seconds, and we\u2019re constantly tracking things like total IT load (the amount of energy our servers and networking equipment are using at any time), outside air temperature (which affects how our cooling towers work) and the levels at which we set our mechanical and cooling equipment. Being a smart guy\u2014our affectionate nickname for him is \u201cBoy Genius\u201d\u2014Jim realized that we could be doing more with this data. He studied up on machine learning and started building models to predict\u2014and improve\u2014data center performance.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8Ba7c72OwJI/U4VvLDhGc6I/AAAAAAAAOlQ/buQPFDcCfyY/s1600/google-datacenter-tech-05.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8Ba7c72OwJI/U4VvLDhGc6I/AAAAAAAAOlQ/buQPFDcCfyY/s1600/google-datacenter-tech-05.jpg\" width=\"550\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>The mechanical plant at our facility in The Dalles, Ore.

In a dynamic environment like a data center, it can be difficult for humans to see how all of the variables\u2014IT load, outside air temperature, etc.\u2014interact with each other. One thing computers are good at is seeing the underlying story in the data, so Jim took the information we gather in the course of our daily operations and ran it through a model to help make sense of complex interactions that his team\u2014being mere mortals\u2014may not otherwise have noticed. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L0SLVNkqYj8/U4VvX5belJI/AAAAAAAAOlc/uMtd_Vwqzp0/s1600/infographic.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L0SLVNkqYj8/U4VvX5belJI/AAAAAAAAOlc/uMtd_Vwqzp0/s1600/infographic.png\" height=\"201\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>A simplified version of what the models do: take a bunch of data, find the hidden interactions, then provide recommendations that optimize for energy efficiency. </i></div>\n<br />\nAfter some trial and error, Jim\u2019s models are now 99.6 percent accurate in predicting PUE. This means he can use the models to come up with new ways to squeeze more efficiency out of our operations. For example, a couple months ago we had to take some servers offline for a few days\u2014which would normally make that data center less energy efficient. But we were able to use Jim\u2019s models to change our cooling setup temporarily\u2014reducing the impact of the change on our PUE for that time period. Small tweaks like this, on an ongoing basis, add up to significant savings in both energy and money. <br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S8qcCScG9Sk/U4VvX6jD4rI/AAAAAAAAOlY/ugOZ_74W8iw/s1600/accuracy.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S8qcCScG9Sk/U4VvX6jD4rI/AAAAAAAAOlY/ugOZ_74W8iw/s1600/accuracy.png\" height=\"292\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>The models can predict PUE with 99.6 percent accuracy.</i></div>\n<br />\nBy pushing the boundaries of data center operations, Jim and his team have opened up a new world of opportunities to improve data center performance and reduce energy consumption. He lays out his approach in the white paper, so other data center operators that dabble in machine learning (or who have a resident genius around who wants to figure it out) can give it a try as well. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Joe Kava, VP, Data Centers</span>", "id": "1276834316258042612", "updated": "2014-05-28T01:00:03-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["energy", "green", "infrastructure"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/1276834316258042612/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2014-05-28T01:00:00-07:00", "title": "Better data centers through machine learning"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/just-press-go-designing-self-driving.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDMyODQ0NTA3MzA5Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/2161141690988329759", "content": "Ever since we <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/what-were-driving-at.html\">started the Google self-driving car project</a>, we\u2019ve been working toward the goal of vehicles that can shoulder the entire burden of driving. Just imagine: You can take a trip downtown at lunchtime without a 20-minute buffer to find parking.  Seniors can keep their freedom even if they can\u2019t keep their car keys. And drunk and distracted driving? History.  <br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re now exploring what fully self-driving vehicles would look like by building some prototypes; they\u2019ll be designed to operate safely and autonomously without requiring human intervention. They won\u2019t have a steering wheel, accelerator pedal, or brake pedal\u2026 because they don\u2019t need them.  Our software and sensors do all the work.  The vehicles will be very basic\u2014we want to learn from them and adapt them as quickly as possible\u2014but they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button. And that's an important step toward improving road safety and transforming mobility for millions of people. <br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/CqSDWoAhvLU\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\nIt was inspiring to start with a blank sheet of paper and ask, \u201cWhat should be different about this kind of vehicle?\u201d We started with the most important thing: safety.

And we\u2019ve capped the speed of these first vehicles at 25 mph. On the inside, we\u2019ve designed for learning, not luxury, so we\u2019re light on creature comforts, but we\u2019ll have two seats (with seatbelts), a space for passengers\u2019 belongings, buttons to start and stop, and a screen that shows the route\u2014and that\u2019s about it.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w5QPQw1mRN8/U4Tnn7tcP1I/AAAAAAAAOlA/7MhxAxnrwnw/s1600/Vehicle+Prototype+Image+Banner+Cropped+600px.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"212\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w5QPQw1mRN8/U4Tnn7tcP1I/AAAAAAAAOlA/7MhxAxnrwnw/s1600/Vehicle+Prototype+Image+Banner+Cropped+600px.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>A very early version of our prototype vehicle, and an artistic rendering of our vehicle</i></div>\n<br />\nWe\u2019re planning to build about a hundred prototype vehicles, and later this summer, our safety drivers will start testing early versions of these vehicles that have manual controls.

Budapest-based educator and inventor Ern\u0151 Rubik created the puzzle originally to help his students better understand spatial geometry. Released to the public in the 1980s, it quickly became an international obsession, bigger than hairspray and breakdancing combined. But the Rubik\u2019s Cube is more than just a toy; it\u2019s a puzzle waiting to be solved and a question waiting to be answered. Over the past 40 years, the cube has puzzled, frustrated, and fascinated so many of us, and has helped spark an interest in math and problem solving in millions of kids.

Seventy-one percent of startups say their hub is having a significant impact on their growth, and companies from the Network have raised more than $50 million and created 1,200 jobs since becoming members.

It helps teachers create and organize assignments quickly, provide feedback efficiently, and communicate with their classes with ease.

They can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback to individual students.</li>\n<li><b>Improve class communications: </b>Teachers can make announcements, ask questions and comment with students in real time\u2014improving communication inside and outside of class.</li>\n<li><b>Stay organized: </b>Classroom automatically creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student. Students can easily see what\u2019s due on their Assignments page.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nWe know that protecting your students\u2019 privacy is critical.

For many students, environmental issues were top of mind, resulting in impressive and artistic doodles depicting water and air purification or turning garbage into flowers. Another common theme was really smart robots; they clean up garbage or help students with their homework. Others created possible solutions for solving obesity or eliminating world hunger. And we saw some thoughtful ideas around time travel and goggles that help you see the world from another person\u2019s point of view so you can truly understand them. <br />\n<br />\nFrom more than 100,000 creative ideas, we\u2019ve selected the best one from each state with the help of our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodle4google/guests.html\">guest judges</a>.

Cars lurching out of hidden driveways. Double-parked delivery trucks blocking your lane and your view. At a busy time of day, a typical city street can leave even experienced drivers sweaty-palmed and irritable. We all dream of a world in which city centers are freed of congestion from cars <a href=\"http://shoup.bol.ucla.edu/CruisingForParkingAccess.pdf\">circling for parking</a>&nbsp;(PDF) and have fewer intersections <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chqEoZ3UMZA\">made dangerous by distracted drivers</a>.

A mile of city driving is much more complex than a mile of freeway driving, with hundreds of different objects moving according to different rules of the road in a small area. We\u2019ve improved our software so it can detect hundreds of distinct objects simultaneously\u2014pedestrians, buses, a stop sign held up by a crossing guard, or a cyclist making gestures that indicate a possible turn. A self-driving vehicle can pay attention to all of these things in a way that a human physically can\u2019t\u2014and it never gets tired or distracted.<br />\n<br />\nHere\u2019s a video showing how our vehicle navigates some common scenarios near the Googleplex: <br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/dk3oc1Hr62g?rel=0\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\nAs it turns out, what looks chaotic and random on a city street to the human eye is actually fairly predictable to a computer. As we\u2019ve encountered thousands of different situations, we\u2019ve built software models of what to expect, from the likely (a car stopping at a red light) to the unlikely (blowing through it). We still have lots of problems to solve, including teaching the car to drive more streets in Mountain View before we tackle another town, but thousands of situations on city streets that would have stumped us two years ago can now be navigated autonomously.<br />\n<br />\nOur vehicles have now logged nearly 700,000 autonomous miles, and with every passing mile we\u2019re growing more optimistic that we\u2019re heading toward an achievable goal\u2014a vehicle that operates fully without human intervention. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Chris Urmson, Director, Self-Driving Car Project</span>", "id": "4503950162350337601", "updated": "2015-05-28T13:21:30-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/4503950162350337601/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2014-04-28T05:00:00-07:00", "title": "The latest chapter for the self-driving car: mastering city street driving  "}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/through-google-lens-search-trends-april.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzk4NDUyNDA1MjQwCm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/919827891923610275", "content": "From <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Lupita+Nyongo&amp;std=20140423&amp;pn=p1#a=20140423-Lupita+Nyong%27o\">Lupita</a> topping the People 50 to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=LaMarcus+Aldridge&amp;std=20140423&amp;pn=p1#a=20140423-LaMarcus+Aldridge\">LaMarcus</a> dropping 46, it\u2019s time to look again at the top trending items on Google Search. <br />\n<br />\n<b>The games we play</b><br />\nThe NBA and NHL playoffs both kicked off in earnest this week, and searches for hockey and basketball topics lit up the scoreboard. In fact, the Chicago Blackhawks occupied a post in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends\">Google\u2019s Hot Searches</a> list<i> every day</i> but one since last Friday. The defending Stanley Cup champions are playing a tight (and, as of Wednesday, tied) series against the St. Louis Blues; they also drew controversy this weekend when stories emerged of the Blackhawks taunting Blues captain David Backes after a hit that got the Hawks\u2019 Brent Seabrook suspended. <br />\n<br />\nIn the NBA, it was all about the big plays. Searches for the OKC Thunder\u2019s Kevin Durant peaked after he made a ridiculous four-point play while (and I don\u2019t use this word lightly) literally falling out of bounds on Tuesday. The last time Durant came close to this level of search interest was <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=kevin%20durant&amp;date=1%2F2014%2012m&amp;cmpt=q\">on January 30</a>, after a 12-game 30+ point scoring streak.

On a more somber note, searches were also high for longtime sideline reporter <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Craig+Sager&amp;std=20140420&amp;pn=p1#a=20140420-Craig+Sager\">Craig Sager</a>, who revealed on Sunday that he has been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MVZsGK3L6eY/U1qwSRcGz9I/AAAAAAAAObg/UbkMs93Po08/s1600/blackhawks.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MVZsGK3L6eY/U1qwSRcGz9I/AAAAAAAAObg/UbkMs93Po08/s1600/blackhawks.jpg\" height=\"400\" width=\"300\" /></a></div>\nMoving to the diamond, [<a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=pine+tar&amp;std=20140423&amp;pn=p1#a=20140423-pine+tar\">pine tar</a>] was the top searched topic overall on Wednesday after Yankees\u2019 starting pitcher Michael Pineda was caught red-handed (and sticky-necked) using the substance, a violation of MLB rules, while elsewhere in the American League the Angels\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Albert+Pujols&amp;std=20140423&amp;pn=p1#a=20140423-Albert+Pujols\">Albert Pujols</a> hit his 500th career home run.

Dyngus Day, a Polish-American holiday taking place on Easter Monday and similar to Poland\u2019s \u015amigus-Dyngus and Hungary\u2019s V\u00edzbevet\u0151, was a top topic in search on Monday (O.K., so it wasn\u2019t <i>the</i> top topic, but it was top of mind for many). <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Amigus-Dyngus\">Traditionally celebrated</a> by boys <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1436&amp;bih=748&amp;q=smigus+dyngus\">throwing water</a> over girls, in the U.S. Dyngus Day celebrations include parades, traditional foods and polka music. Whatever its origins, interest in Dyngus Day <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=dyngus%20day&amp;date=1%2F2014%2012m%2C%201%2F2013%2012m%2C%201%2F2012%2012m&amp;cmpt=date\">has been growing steadily the past two years</a> since barely registering on Search in 2012.<br />\n<br />\nWhat the\u2026 powdered alcohol?!

She spends her days collecting data about wildlife in order to track the animals, assess threats, and provide support where needed.

Take a peek: <br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/0-jnefZuOhA?rel=0\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\nRhino monitoring can be a slow process, especially in habitats with tricky terrain, but data collection is crucial for making the right conservation decisions. Most parts of Chitwan National Park are inaccessible to vehicles, so Sabita and her team ride in on elephants, and have been collecting health and habitat data using pencil and paper.<br />\n<br />\nNow custom-built Glassware (the Glass version of apps) called Field Notes can help Sabita do her work hands-free instead of gathering data in a notebook. That\u2019s helpful for both accuracy and safety when you\u2019re on an elephant. Using voice commands, Sabita and other researchers can take photos and videos, and map a rhino\u2019s location, size, weight, and other notable characteristics. The notes collected can also be automatically uploaded to a shared doc back at the office, making it easier to collaborate with other researchers, and potentially a lot faster than typing up handwritten notes.<br />\n<br />\nThis is just one example of a nonprofit exploring how Glass can make their critical work easier.

Our Google+ Community page hosts Hangouts on Air with CS industry leaders, Googlers, and top educators on a regular basis. And we\u2019ve added a new <a href=\"http://cs4hs.com/resources/\">Resources page</a> with online workshops, tutorials and information on computational thinking, robotics and more.

This updated Report details the number of government requests we received for user information in criminal investigations during the second half of 2013. Government requests for user information in criminal cases have increased by about 120 percent since we first began publishing these numbers in 2009. Though our number of users has grown throughout the time period, we\u2019re also seeing more and more governments start to exercise their authority to make requests. <br />\n<br />\nWe consistently push back against overly broad requests for your personal information, but it\u2019s also important for laws to explicitly protect you from government overreach. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working alongside eight other companies to push for <a href=\"http://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/\">surveillance reform</a>, including more transparency. We\u2019ve all been sharing best practices about how to report the requests we receive, and as a result our Transparency Report now includes governments that made less than 30 requests during a six-month reporting period, in addition to those that made 30+ requests. <br />\n<br />\nAlso, people have been asking about how we respond to search warrants in the U.S., so we\u2019ve created an entertaining <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeKKHxcJfh0\">video</a> to explain in plain language how this process works.

As you go about your day reading, writing and checking messages, there are tons of security measures running behind the scenes to keep your email safe, secure, and there whenever you need it.<br />\n<br />\nStarting today, Gmail will always use an encrypted HTTPS connection when you check or send email. Gmail has <a href=\"http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/making-security-easier.html\">supported HTTPS</a> since the day it launched, and in 2010 we made <a href=\"http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/default-https-access-for-gmail.html\">HTTPS the default</a>. Today's change means that no one can listen in on your messages as they go back and forth between you and Gmail\u2019s servers\u2014no matter if you're using public WiFi or logging in from your computer, phone or tablet. <br />\n<br />\nIn addition, every single email message you send or receive\u2014100 percent of them\u2014is encrypted while moving internally. This ensures that your messages are safe not only when they move between you and Gmail's servers, but also as they move between Google's data centers\u2014something we made a top priority after last summer\u2019s revelations.<br />\n<br />\nOf course, being able to access your email is just as important as keeping it safe and secure. In 2013, Gmail was available 99.978 percent of the time, which averages to less than two hours of disruption for a user for the entire year. Our engineering experts look after Google's services 24x7 and if a problem ever arises, they're on the case immediately. We keep you informed by posting updates on the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/appsstatus\">Apps Status Dashboard</a> until the issue is fixed, and we always conduct a full analysis on the problem to prevent it from happening again.<br />\n<br />\nOur commitment to the security and reliability of your email is absolute, and we\u2019re constantly working on ways to improve. You can learn about additional ways to keep yourself safe online, like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/safetycenter/everyone/start/password/\">creating strong passwords</a> and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/2step/\">enabling 2-step verification</a>, by visiting the Security Center: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/help/security\">https://www.google.com/help/security</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Nicolas Lidzborski, Gmail Security Engineering Lead</span><br />\n<i><br />\nCross-posted from the <a href=\"http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/03/staying-at-forefront-of-email-security.html\">Official Gmail Blog</a></i>", "id": "212488774537245440", "updated": "2014-03-20T09:43:59-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["apps"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/212488774537245440/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2014-03-20T09:43:00-07:00", "title": "Staying at the forefront of email security and reliability: HTTPS-only and 99.978 percent availability"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/03/chromecast-now-casting-in-11-more.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDI0MjI0ODExOTEyCm9mZnNldDogLTI4ODAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/3018200079224837944", "content": "<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/The_Dark_Knight?id=TQfcgaNdBCA\">Superheroes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.redbull.tv/Redbulltv\">cliff divers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ\">fearless reporters</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/music/artist/One_Direction?id=Am74h5d2ey6lmmocwkduh75zpvi\">pop icons</a>\u2014whatever you like to watch, <a href=\"http://www.chromecast.com/\">Chromecast</a> makes it easy to bring it from a phone, tablet or laptop to the biggest screen in your house: the TV.

Apps will start rolling out today, and include BBC iPlayer in the U.K.; France TV Pluzz and SFR TV in France with CANALPLAY coming soon; and Watchever in Germany with Maxdome coming soon. So instead of huddling around your laptop to watch Sherlock solve the next crime or getting caught up on all the workplace drama in Stromberg, you can cast it, sit back, and watch together on the big screen.<br />\n<br />\nChromecast will keep getting better. We recently opened up <a href=\"http://chrome.blogspot.com/2014/02/chromecast-is-now-open-to-developers.html\">Chromecast to developers</a>, and in a few short weeks more than 3,000 developers worldwide have signed up to bring their apps and websites to Chromecast.

That\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about wearables\u2014they understand the context of the world around you, and you can interact with them simply and efficiently, with just a glance or a spoken word.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Android Wear: Information that moves with you&nbsp;</b><br />\nToday we\u2019re announcing Android Wear, a project that extends Android to wearables. And we\u2019re starting with the most familiar wearable\u2014watches. Going well beyond the mere act of just telling you the time, a range of new devices along with an expansive catalogue of apps will give you:<br />\n<ul>\n<li><b>Useful information when you need it most.</b> Android Wear shows you info and suggestions you need, right when you need them. The wide variety of Android applications means you\u2019ll receive the latest posts and updates from your favorite social apps, chats from your preferred messaging apps, notifications from shopping, news and photography apps, and more.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><b>Straight answers to spoken questions.</b> Just say \u201cOk Google\u201d to ask questions, like how many calories are in an avocado, what time your flight leaves, and the score of the game. Or say \u201cOk Google\u201d to get stuff done, like calling a taxi, sending a text, making a restaurant reservation or setting an alarm.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><b>The ability to better monitor your health and fitness.</b> Hit your exercise goals with reminders and fitness summaries from Android Wear. Your favorite fitness apps can give you real-time speed, distance and time information on your wrist for your run, cycle or walk.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><b>Your key to a multiscreen world.</b> Android Wear lets you access and control other devices from your wrist.  Just say \u201cOk Google\u201d to fire up a music playlist on your phone, or cast your favorite movie to your TV. There\u2019s a lot of possibilities here so we\u2019re eager to see what developers build.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<br /></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/QrqZl2QIz0c\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<br /></div>\n<b>Developer Preview&nbsp;</b><br />\nIf you\u2019re a developer, there\u2019s a new section on <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/wear\">developer.android.com/wear</a> focused on wearables. Starting today, you can download a Developer Preview so you can tailor your existing app notifications for watches powered by Android Wear. Because Android for wearables works with Android's rich notification system, many apps will already work well. Look out for more developer resources and APIs coming soon. We\u2019re also already working with several consumer electronics manufacturers, including Asus, HTC, LG, Motorola and Samsung; chip makers Broadcom, Imagination, Intel, Mediatek and Qualcomm; and fashion brands like the Fossil Group to bring you watches powered by Android Wear later this year.<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<br /></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/0xQ3y902DEQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<br /></div>\nWe're always seeking new ways for technology to help people live their lives and this is just another step in that journey.

The piece, entitled <i><a href=\"http://www.unnumberedsparks.com/\">Unnumbered Sparks</a></i>, is a collaboration between artist&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.echelman.com/\">Janet Echelman</a> and Google Creative Director Aaron Koblin, as part of <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/\">TED</a>\u2019s 30th annual conference.  <br />\n<br />\nEchelman is known for building sculptures that respond to the forces of nature\u2014wind, water and light\u2014and this project is no exception. Made from ultralight fibers, the sculpture soars from the roof of a skyscraper over the water and walkways near the Vancouver Convention Center (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/49%C2%B017'17.3%22N+123%C2%B006'52.8%22W/@49.2881389,-123.1146667,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x\">site map</a>).

The interactive lighting is actually one giant Chrome window, stretched across the 300-foot long sculpture with the help of five high-definition projectors. To interact, visitors open a website using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome/\">Chrome</a> or other modern mobile browser on their smartphone or tablet. After selecting a color, they use their fingers to trace paths along the surface of their device, which are then projected onto the sculpture in real-time as colorful beams of light.

On March 12, 1989, I distributed <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html\">a proposal</a> to improve information flows: \u201ca \u2018web\u2019 of notes with links between them.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nThough <a href=\"http://home.web.cern.ch/\">CERN</a>, as a physics lab, couldn\u2019t justify such a general software project, my boss Mike Sendall allowed me to work on it on the side. In 1990, I wrote the first browser and editor. In 1993, after much urging, CERN declared that WWW technology would be available to all, without paying royalties, forever.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rxjuibVtp6o/Ux_X4EpzjqI/AAAAAAAAONU/2rZRhPpPl2E/s1600/800px-First_Web_Server.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rxjuibVtp6o/Ux_X4EpzjqI/AAAAAAAAONU/2rZRhPpPl2E/s1600/800px-First_Web_Server.jpg\" height=\"240\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>The first web server, used by Tim Berners-Lee.

Now, <a href=\"http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/press_releases/2013/41.aspx#.UxmA8_mSydg\">about 40 percent of us</a> are connected and creating online. The web has generated <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/internet_matters\">trillions of dollars of economic value</a>, transformed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning\">education</a> and <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/6-ways-technology-is-improving-healthcare-2010-12?op=1\">healthcare</a> and activated many new movements for democracy around the world. And we\u2019re just getting started.<br />\n<br />\nHow has this happened? By design, the underlying Internet and the WWW are non-hierarchical, decentralized and radically open. The web can be made to work with any type of information, on any device, with any software, in any language. You can link to any piece of information. You don\u2019t need to ask for permission. What you create is limited only by your imagination.<br />\n<br />\nSo today is a day to celebrate. But it\u2019s also an occasion to think, discuss\u2014and do. Key decisions on the governance and future of the Internet are looming, and it\u2019s vital for all of us to speak up for the web\u2019s future. How can we ensure that the other 60 percent around the world who are not connected get online fast? How can we make sure that the web supports all languages and cultures, not just the dominant ones? How do we build consensus around open standards to link the coming Internet of Things? Will we allow others to package and restrict our online experience, or will we protect the magic of the open web and the power it gives us to say, discover, and create anything? How can we build systems of checks and balances to hold the groups that  can spy on the net accountable to the public? These are some of my questions\u2014what are yours?<br />\n<br />\nOn the 25th birthday of the web, I ask you to join in\u2014to help us imagine and build the future standards for the web, and to press for every country to develop a digital bill of rights to advance a free and open web for everyone.

People are hungrier than ever for faster Internet, and as a result, cities across America are making speed a priority. Hundreds of mayors from across the U.S.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://usmayors.org/resolutions/81st_Conference/resolutions-adopted.pdf\">have stated</a>&nbsp;(PDF) that abundant high-speed Internet access is essential for sparking innovation, driving economic growth and improving education. <a href=\"http://www.portlandoregon.gov/revenue/article/394195\">Portland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/Planning/docs/NashvilleNext/ECD%20background%20reportforonline%20posting.pdf\">Nashville</a>&nbsp;(PDF) and dozens of others have made high-speed broadband a pillar of their economic development plans. And Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio, <a href=\"http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/High-speed-Internet-access-a-classroom-necessity-4621487.php\">declared</a> in June that every school should have access to gigabit speeds by 2020. <br />\n<br />\nWe've long believed that the Internet\u2019s next chapter will be built on gigabit speeds, so it\u2019s fantastic to see this momentum. And now that we\u2019ve learned a lot from our Google Fiber projects in <a href=\"http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2013/11/one-year-of-fiber-in-kansas-city.html\">Kansas City</a>, <a href=\"http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2013/11/just-for-austin-how-youll-be-able-to.html\">Austin</a> and <a href=\"http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2014/01/new-year-new-internet-choice-for-provo.html\">Provo</a>, we want to help build more ultra-fast networks. So we\u2019ve invited cities in nine metro areas around the U.S.\u2014<a href=\"https://fiber.google.com/newcities/\">34 cities altogether</a>\u2014to work with us to explore what it would take to bring them Google Fiber.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7PjU-KYQDWo/UwToJwZHrAI/AAAAAAAAODw/fu-aao_DTOU/s1600/1200map_updated_green2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7PjU-KYQDWo/UwToJwZHrAI/AAAAAAAAODw/fu-aao_DTOU/s1600/1200map_updated_green2.png\" height=\"358\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\nWe aim to provide updates by the end of the year about which cities will be getting Google Fiber. Between now and then, we\u2019ll work closely with each city\u2019s leaders on a joint planning process that will not only map out a Google Fiber network in detail, but also assess what unique local challenges we might face. These are such big jobs that advance planning goes a long way toward helping us stick to schedules and minimize disruption for residents.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re going to work on a detailed study of local factors that could affect construction, like topography (e.g., hills, flood zones), housing density and the condition of local infrastructure. Meanwhile, cities will complete a checklist of items that will help them get ready for a project of this scale and speed. For example, they\u2019ll provide us with maps of existing conduit, water, gas and electricity lines so that we can plan where to place fiber. They\u2019ll also help us find ways to access existing infrastructure\u2014like utility poles\u2014so we don\u2019t unnecessarily dig up streets or have to put up a new pole next to an existing one. <br />\n<br />\nWhile we do want to bring Fiber to every one of these cities, it might not work out for everyone. But cities who go through this process with us will be more prepared for us or any provider who wants to build a fiber network. In fact, we want to give everyone a boost in their thinking about how to bring fiber to their communities; we plan to share what we learn in these 34 cities, and in the meantime you can check out some tips in <a href=\"http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2014/02/how-communities-can-facilitate-fiber.html\">a recent guest post on the Google Fiber blog</a> by industry expert <a href=\"http://www.ctcnet.us/contact-us/who-we-are/joanne-hovis-president/\">Joanne Hovis</a>.

Our investments to date include <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\">SurveyMonkey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lendingclub.com/\">Lending Club</a> and <a href=\"http://renaissance.com/\">Renaissance Learning</a>\u2014with many more to come. <br />\n<br />\nBut it\u2019s not just a monetary investment for us. The most important\u2014and distinctive\u2014feature of Google Capital is how we work with our portfolio companies. Over the past 15 years, Google has built a strong business, and that\u2019s mostly thanks to the great people who work here. Our portfolio companies have abundant access to the talent, passion and strategic expertise of some of Google\u2019s technology and product leaders. While many investors may contribute money and advice to the companies they support, Google Capital is going beyond that and tapping into our greatest assets: our people.  They help <i>us</i> succeed, and we believe they can help our portfolio companies do the same.<br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s still very early, and investing is a long road. We\u2019re excited about what we\u2019re doing today\u2014but even more excited to see what happens in the years to come. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by David Lawee, Partner, Google Capital</span>", "id": "5428645860211541243", "updated": "2014-02-19T10:07:46-08:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/5428645860211541243/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2014-02-19T04:00:00-08:00", "title": "Google Capital: investing in growth-stage companies"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/02/kicking-off-2014-google-science-fair.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzkyMjIxMDkzNTcwCm9mZnNldDogLTI4ODAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/6035362812177777449", "content": "What if you could turn one of your passions into something that could change the world?

Here are a few highlights: <br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n<li><b>Instant meeting room</b>. Chromebox for meetings comes with a blazing-fast Intel Core i7-based Chromebox, a high-definition camera, a combined microphone and speaker unit and a remote control. Set up your entire room in minutes and easily manage all meeting rooms from a web-based management console. All you need is the display in your room, and you\u2019re good to go.</li>\n<li><b>Simpler and faster meetings</b>. Walk into the room, click the remote once and you\u2019re instantly in the meeting. No more complex dial-in codes, passcodes or leader PINs. Share your laptop screen wirelessly, no need for any cords and adaptors. Integration with Google Apps makes it easy to invite others and add rooms to video meetings, directly from Google Calendar.</li>\n<li><b>Meetings with anyone, anywhere</b>. Up to 15 participants can join the video meeting from other conference rooms, their laptops, tablets or smartphones. Need to meet with a customer who doesn\u2019t use Chromebox for meetings?

That means for the same price that companies have typically paid for one meeting room, they'll be able to outfit 10 rooms\u2014or more. CDW and SYNNEX will help bring Chromebox for meetings to customers and resellers, and Chromeboxes from HP and Dell will be available for meetings in the coming months. Later this year, we plan to launch in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, New Zealand, Spain and the U.K.<br />\n<br />\nCompanies like Eventbrite, Gilt, oDesk and Woolworths have been testing Chromebox for meetings, and have <a href=\"https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/business/solutions/for-meetings.html?utm_source=0214cfmlaunch&amp;utm_medium=blog#customers\">told us</a> that they love the simple setup, the ease of use, and being able to see their colleagues in other offices.

Unfortunately, many kids don\u2019t have access to either the education or encouragement they need to pursue computer science. So five years ago we created the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/edu/programs/google-rise-awards/\">Google RISE (Roots in Science and Engineering) Awards</a>, which provide funding to organizations around the world that engage girls and underrepresented students in extracurricular computer science programs.<br />\n<br />\nThis year, the RISE Awards are providing $1.5 million to 42 organizations in 19 countries that provide students with the resources they need to succeed in the field. For example, <a href=\"http://www.generatinggenius.org.uk/\">Generating Genius</a> in the U.K. provides after-school computer science programs and mentoring to prepare high-achieving students from disadvantaged communities for admission into top universities. Another awardee, North Carolina-based <a href=\"http://starscomputingcorps.org/\">STARS Computer Corps</a>, helps schools in low-income communities gain access to computing resources for their students to use.

Under FISA, the government may apply for orders from a special FISA Court to require U.S. companies to hand over users\u2019 personal information and the content of their communications. Although FISA was passed by elected representatives and is available for anyone to read, the way the law is used is typically kept secret. Last summer\u2019s revelations about government surveillance remind us of the challenges that secrecy can present to a democracy that relies on public debate.<br />\n<br />\nLast year we <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/09/petition-for-greater-transparency.html\">filed a lawsuit</a> asking the FISA Court to let us disclose the number of FISA requests we may receive and how many users/accounts they include. We\u2019d previously secured permission to publish information about <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/transparency-report-shedding-more-light.html\">National Security Letters</a>, and FISA requests were the only remaining type of demands excluded from our report.<br />\n<br />\nToday, for the first time, our report on government requests for user information encompasses all of the requests we receive, subject only to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/faq/#fisa_delays\">delays imposed by the DoJ</a> regarding how quickly we can include certain requests in our statistics.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-trnSw3iC6eE/Uu_alz42-yI/AAAAAAAAOAY/Yc18_7fJIV4/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-03+at+9.59.12+AM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-trnSw3iC6eE/Uu_alz42-yI/AAAAAAAAOAY/Yc18_7fJIV4/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-03+at+9.59.12+AM.png\" height=\"614\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\nPublishing <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/US/\">these numbers</a> is a step in the right direction, and speaks to the <a href=\"http://reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/\">principles for reform</a> that we announced with other companies last December. But we still believe more transparency is needed so everyone can better understand how surveillance laws work and decide whether or not they serve the public interest. Specifically, we want to disclose the precise numbers and types of requests we receive, as well as the number of users they affect in a timely way. That\u2019s why we need Congress to go another step further and pass <a href=\"https://www.cdt.org/files/pdfs/weneedtoknow-transparency-bills-support-letter.pdf\">legislation</a>&nbsp;(PDF)&nbsp;that will enable us to say more.<br />\n<br />\nYou have the right to know how laws affect the security of your information online.

As this is an important move for Android users everywhere, I wanted to explain why in detail.  <br />\n<br />\nWe acquired Motorola in 2012 to help <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/supercharging-android-google-to-acquire.html\">supercharge the Android ecosystem</a> by creating a stronger patent portfolio for Google and great smartphones for users. Over the past 19 months, Dennis Woodside and the Motorola team have done a tremendous job reinventing the company.  They\u2019ve focused on building a smaller number of great (and great value) smartphones that consumers love.  Both the Moto G and the Moto X are doing really well, and I\u2019m very excited about the smartphone lineup for 2014.  And on the intellectual property side, Motorola\u2019s patents have helped create a level playing field, which is good news for all Android\u2019s users and partners.<br />\n<br />\nBut the smartphone market is super competitive, and to thrive it helps to be all-in when it comes to making mobile devices.  It\u2019s why we believe that Motorola will be better served by Lenovo\u2014which has a rapidly growing smartphone business and is the largest (and fastest-growing) PC manufacturer in the world. This move will enable Google to devote our energy to driving innovation across the Android ecosystem, for the benefit of smartphone users everywhere. As a side note, this does not signal a larger shift for our other hardware efforts. The dynamics and maturity of the wearable and home markets, for example, are very different from that of the mobile industry. We\u2019re excited by the opportunities to build amazing new products for users within these emerging ecosystems.<br />\n<br />\nLenovo has the expertise and track record to scale Motorola into a major player within the Android ecosystem. They have a lot of experience in hardware, and they have global reach. In addition, Lenovo intends to keep Motorola\u2019s distinct brand identity\u2014just as they did when they acquired ThinkPad from IBM in 2005.  Google will retain the vast majority of Motorola\u2019s patents, which we will continue to use to defend the entire Android ecosystem.  <br />\n<br />\nThe deal has yet to be approved in the U.S. or China, and this usually takes time. So until then, it\u2019s business as usual. I\u2019m phenomenally impressed with everything the Motorola team has achieved and confident that with Lenovo as a partner, Motorola will build more and more great products for people everywhere.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Larry Page, CEO</span>", "id": "3212166058835738620", "updated": "2014-01-29T14:00:08-08:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/3212166058835738620/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2014-01-29T14:00:00-08:00", "title": "Lenovo to acquire Motorola Mobility"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/01/chrome-lego-you-can-build-whatever-you.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDI0MjI0ODEyMDM5Cm9mZnNldDogLTI4ODAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/7255854475558118598", "content": "Think back: you\u2019ve just dumped a bin of LEGO<sup>R</sup> bricks onto the floor with a satisfying crash, and you have the whole day ahead of you to build whatever you want.

Correcting the bug in the configuration generator to prevent recurrence, and auditing all other critical configuration generation systems to ensure they do not contain a similar bug.<br />\n2. Adding additional input validation checks for configurations, so that a bad configuration generated in the future will not result in service disruption.<br />\n3. Adding additional targeted monitoring to more quickly detect and diagnose the cause of service failure.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Ben Treynor, VP Engineering </span>", "id": "3095486580021934630", "updated": "2014-01-24T16:47:41-08:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/3095486580021934630/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2014-01-24T16:46:00-08:00", "title": "Today\u2019s outage for several Google services"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/01/hit-road-with-president-obama-in-first.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzkwNDg1NjAxNDYyCm9mZnNldDogLTI4ODAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/3646150022256089000", "content": "Next Tuesday, at 9pm EST, President Obama will deliver his annual State of the Union address to Congress.

But you may not be familiar with the daily struggle that many people with diabetes face as they try to keep their blood sugar levels under control. Uncontrolled blood sugar puts people at risk for a range of dangerous complications, some short-term and others longer term, including damage to the eyes, kidneys and heart. A friend of ours told us she worries about her mom, who once passed out from low blood sugar and drove her car off the road. <br />\n<br />\nMany people I\u2019ve talked to say managing their diabetes is like having a part-time job. Glucose levels change frequently with normal activity like exercising or eating or even sweating. Sudden spikes or precipitous drops are dangerous and not uncommon, requiring round-the-clock monitoring. Although some people wear glucose monitors with a glucose sensor embedded under their skin, all people with diabetes must still prick their finger and test drops of blood throughout the day. It\u2019s disruptive, and it\u2019s painful. And, as a result, many people with diabetes check their blood glucose less often than they should.  <br />\n<br />\nOver the years, many scientists have investigated various body fluids\u2014such as tears\u2014in the hopes of finding an easier way for people to track their glucose levels. But as you can imagine, tears are hard to collect and study. At Google[x], we wondered if miniaturized electronics\u2014think: chips and sensors so small they look like bits of glitter, and an antenna thinner than a human hair\u2014might be a way to crack the mystery of tear glucose and measure it with greater accuracy.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mi6GFZvtLgM/UthX4TvBpjI/AAAAAAAAN_A/KYGNt93Ri5E/s1600/Hand+holding+-+zoomed+in.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mi6GFZvtLgM/UthX4TvBpjI/AAAAAAAAN_A/KYGNt93Ri5E/s1600/Hand+holding+-+zoomed+in.jpg\" height=\"266\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\nWe\u2019re now testing a smart contact lens that\u2019s built to measure glucose levels in tears using a tiny wireless chip and miniaturized glucose sensor that are embedded between two layers of soft contact lens material. We\u2019re testing prototypes that can generate a reading once per second.  We\u2019re also investigating the potential for this to serve as an early warning for the wearer, so we\u2019re exploring integrating tiny LED lights that could light up to indicate that glucose levels have crossed above or below certain thresholds.  It\u2019s still early days for this technology, but we\u2019ve completed multiple clinical research studies which are helping to refine our prototype. We hope this could someday lead to a new way for people with diabetes to manage their disease.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re in discussions with the FDA, but there\u2019s still a lot more work to do to turn this technology into a system that people can use. We\u2019re not going to do this alone: we plan to look for partners who are experts in bringing products like this to market. These partners will use our technology for a smart contact lens and develop apps that would make the measurements available to the wearer and their doctor.

Today, for the eighth time, we\u2019re releasing new numbers showing <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/\">requests from governments to remove content</a> from our services. From January to June 2013, we received 3,846 government requests to remove 24,737 pieces of content\u2014a 68 percent increase over the second half of 2012.<br />\n<br />\nOver the past four years, one worrying trend has remained consistent: governments continue to ask us to remove political content. Judges have asked us to remove information that\u2019s critical of them, police departments want us to take down videos or blogs that shine a light on their conduct, and local institutions like town councils don\u2019t want people to be able to find information about their decision-making processes. These officials often cite defamation, privacy and even copyright laws in attempts to remove political speech from our services. In this particular reporting period, we received 93 requests to take down government criticism and removed content in response to less than one third of them. Four of the requests were submitted as copyright claims. <br />\n<br />\nYou can read more about these requests in the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/notes/?by=period\">Notes</a> section of the Transparency Report. In addition, we saw a significant increase in the number of requests we received from two countries in the first half of 2013:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>There was a sharp increase in requests from <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/TR/\">Turkey</a>. We received 1,673 requests from Turkish authorities to remove content from our platforms, nearly a tenfold increase over the second half of last year. About two-thirds of the total requests\u20141,126 to be exact\u2014called for the removal of 1,345 pieces of content related to alleged violations of <a href=\"http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=244466\">law 5651</a>.</li>\n<li>Another place where we saw an increase was&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/RU/\">Russia</a>, where there has been an uptick in requests since a <a href=\"http://www.rg.ru/2012/10/29/reestr-dok.html\">blacklist law</a> took effect last fall. We received 257 removal requests during this reporting period, which is more than double the number of requests we received throughout 2012.</li>\n</ul>\nWhile the information we present in our Transparency Report is certainly not a comprehensive view of censorship online, it does demonstrate a worrying upward trend in the number of government requests, and underscores the importance of transparency around the processes governing such requests. As we continue to add data, we hope it will become increasingly useful and informative in policy debates and decisions around the world. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Susan Infantino, Legal Director</span>", "id": "4082594142070505872", "updated": "2013-12-19T08:11:46-08:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/4082594142070505872/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-12-19T08:00:00-08:00", "title": "Transparency Report: Government removal requests continue to rise"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/12/2013-in-search-heroes-tragedies-and.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzg3Mjg3NzcxMzU4Cm9mZnNldDogLTI4ODAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/3212367357870715808", "content": "Every day, around the world, we search.

Global search interest in the former President of South Africa was already high this year, and after his passing, people from around the world turned to Google to learn more about Madiba and his legacy.<br />\n<br />\nTragedies like the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/topcharts#vm=trendingchart&amp;cid=zgWW1&amp;geo=&amp;date=2013&amp;cat=\">Boston Marathon</a>, the 6th trending term globally, and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/topcharts#vm=trendingchart&amp;cid=zgWW3&amp;geo=&amp;date=2013&amp;cat=\">Typhoon Haiyan</a>, #2 on our global events list, also captured the world\u2019s attention.

People uploaded more than 1.7 million video versions of the Harlem Shake to YouTube, propelling it to the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/topcharts#vm=trendingchart&amp;cid=zgWW1&amp;geo=&amp;date=2013&amp;cat=\">#5 spot</a>&nbsp;on our global list; it was also the <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/12/youtube-rewind-what-you-watched-in-2013.html\">second most trending video on YouTube</a>. And unashamedly, we all wanted to learn about twerking, which topped this year\u2019s \"what is\u2026\"&nbsp;list of search terms (although I\u2019m still not sure I understand that one!). <br />\n<br />\nHere\u2019s a full look at our top 10 global trending searches of 2013:<br />\n<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Nelson Mandela</li>\n<li>Paul Walker</li>\n<li>iPhone 5s</li>\n<li>Cory Monteith</li>\n<li>Harlem Shake</li>\n<li>Boston Marathon</li>\n<li>Royal Baby</li>\n<li>Samsung Galaxy s4</li>\n<li>PlayStation 4</li>\n<li>North Korea</li>\n</ol>\n<br />\nYou can also explore more global trends this year\u2014directly from our <a href=\"http://google.com/zeitgeist\">Zeitgeist homepage</a>.

See where Santa\u2019s going, the number of presents he\u2019s delivered, and what he\u2019s thinking throughout the evening. <br />\n<br />\nKeep up the holiday cheer across all of your screens. Once the elves approve, we\u2019ll launch the Google Santa Tracker app for Android in mid-December. Use your phone for on-the-go flight practice with the elves or cozy up near the fireplace with your tablet to follow Santa around the world as he delivers presents Christmas Eve. If you have Chromecast, cast from the Santa Tracker Android app to explore the Village or track his route right from your TV. Or, worried you\u2019ll forget the big day?

Our goal is simple: help people help each other. We want to use the convenience and efficiency of the web to enable everyone, no matter where they are or what time it is, to easily connect with someone who can help.<br />\n<br />\nHelp might be a quick answer to a problem you\u2019re having right now, like how to fix your garage door, or how to remove a computer virus; or it might be guidance completing a project, like building a deck. It might be learning a new skill, like how to speak conversational French or how to draw cartoons; or it might be general advice on how to improve your fitness or your writing (I could use this right now).<br />\n<br />\nWith Helpouts, you can choose who you get help from based on their qualifications, their availability, their price, their ratings and reviews. You can connect instantly or book in advance. You can get help from individuals or from brands you already know and trust, like <a href=\"https://helpouts.google.com/101139054682230153939\">Sephora</a>, <a href=\"https://helpouts.google.com/108135037100946836685\">One Medical</a>, <a href=\"https://helpouts.google.com/103934178127017229125\">Weight Watchers</a>, <a href=\"https://helpouts.google.com/102191286201532180154\">Redbeacon</a> (a Home Depot company), and <a href=\"https://helpouts.google.com/110544277164840928665\">Rosetta Stone</a>.  Once you\u2019re in a Helpout, you can do more than just talk\u2014you can share your computer screen, collaboratively edit a presentation, or record your Helpout.  And if the experience doesn\u2019t meet your expectations, we offer a full money back guarantee.<br />\n<br />\nToday is just the beginning. We\u2019re starting small and in a few categories. The number of people giving help on Helpouts and the type of help available will grow over time. Helpouts may not be suitable for every occasion, and it will take time to get used to interactions via real time video.  We hope that the efficiency, convenience and global reach of Helpouts will make people\u2019s lives easier in the long term.  <br />\n<br />\nWe hope you\u2019ll give Helpouts a try and give us your feedback through ratings and reviews, or talk to us on <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+helpouts/\">Google+</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helpouts\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Helpouts/161804014010027\">Facebook</a>.

First, we're excited to unwrap our latest platform release, KitKat, which delivers a smarter, more immersive Android experience to even more people. And second, we're introducing Nexus 5\u2014a new Nexus phone developed with LG.<br />\n<br />\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice about KitKat is we\u2019ve made the experience much more engaging: the book you're reading, the game you're playing, or the movie you're watching\u2014now all of these take center stage with the new immersive mode, which automatically hides everything except what you really want to see. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Bringing more Google smarts to Android </b><br />\nBehind the polish on the screen is the power under the hood. Take the Phone app, which for most people hasn\u2019t really changed since the days of flip phones. Now, we\u2019re making calling easier than ever, by helping you search across your contacts, nearby places, or even Google Apps accounts (like your company\u2019s directory), directly from within the app. And with the <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/10/google-hangouts-and-photos-save-some.html\">new Hangouts app</a>, all of your SMS and MMS messages are together in the same place, alongside your other conversations and video calls, so you\u2019ll never miss a message no matter how your friends send it. This is just a small taste of KitKat\u2014learn more on our <a href=\"http://www.android.com/versions/kit-kat-4-4/\">site</a>.<br />\n<br />\nGoogle has always focused on helping users get immediate access to the information they need, and we want to bring this same convenience and power to users on Android. With the new Nexus 5 launcher, Google smarts are deeply integrated into the phone you carry around with you, so getting to the information you need is simple, easy and fast. Swipe once from the home screen to get Google Now literally at your fingertips. Put Google to work for you by saying \u201cOK, Google\u201d to launch voice search, send a text, get directions or even play a song you want to hear. And in the coming weeks, we\u2019re enhancing Now with important new card types that bring you information about contextual topics that interest you such as updates from a favorite website or blog.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Reaching the next 1 billion users</b><br />\nBuilding a platform that makes mobile phones accessible for everyone has always been at the heart of Android. Until now, some lower-end Android phones couldn't benefit from more recent Android releases due to memory constraints. With KitKat, we've slimmed down Android\u2019s memory footprint by doing things like removing unnecessary background services and reducing the memory consumption of features that you use all the time. We did this not only within Android but across Google services like Chrome and YouTube. RAM (or memory) is one of the most expensive parts of a phone, and now Android can run comfortably on the 512MB of RAM devices that are popular in much of the world, bringing the latest goodies in Android 4.4 within reach for the next billion smartphone users.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Introducing Nexus 5</b><br />\nAlong with our <a href=\"http://www.android.com/kitkat/\">sweet naming tradition</a>, we also introduce a new device with each platform release to showcase the latest Android innovations. For KitKat, we partnered with LG to develop Nexus 5 -- the slimmest and fastest Nexus phone ever made. Its design is simple and refined to showcase the 5\u201d Full HD display. Nexus 5 also keeps you connected at blazing speeds with 4G/LTE and ultra fast wifi. The advanced new lens on Nexus 5 captures more light for brighter night and sharper action shots. And with optical image stabilization, you no longer have to worry about shaky hands and blurry pictures. A new HDR+ mode automatically snaps a rapid burst of photos and combines them to give you the best possible single shot.

Guddu wandered beyond the station and Saroo fell asleep on a stationary train waiting for his brother\u2019s return. When he woke up, the train had left the station, separating Saroo from his home and family.</div><br />\nThe train Saroo boarded was in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=Berhampur%2C+Odisha%2C+India&amp;data=!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x3a3d500ef1cb60ad%3A0x5b75778874294ff!3m8!1m3!1d28433!2d76.3512036!3d21.8350454!3m2!1i1280!2i737!4f13.1!4m2!3d19.3149618!4d84.7940911\">Berhanpur, India</a>, and he ended up 1,500 kilometers away, in Calcutta. For weeks, he survived on the streets. Eventually, he was taken into an orphanage, where he was adopted by the Brierleys, an Australian family. He moved across an ocean to the town of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=hobart+australia&amp;data=!4m12!2m11!1m10!1s0xaa6e7584e52ccfed%3A0x503c94dd0de1530!3m8!1m3!1d97762!2d-105.2399774!3d40.0293099!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1\">Hobart</a> in Tasmania. At six years old, Saroo had a new family, home, country and name. Though Saroo Munshi Khan couldn\u2019t find his home, Saroo Brierley never gave up the search. <br />\n<br />\nIn 2011, using vague memories and Google Earth imagery, Saroo identified his home town. Using the ruler feature in Google Earth, he mapped out a search radius by making an educated guess about how far he traveled by train. After countless hours of scouring this area of Google Earth imagery, he came upon a proverbial needle in a haystack. Saroo spotted one vague landmark that led him to the next, helping him unlock a five-year-old child\u2019s memories. He eventually spotted a neighborhood, street and tin roof that looked familiar. <br />\n<br />\nIn Saroo's words, \"It was just like being Superman. You are able to go over and take a photo mentally and ask, 'Does this match?' And when you say, 'No,' you keep on going and going and going.\"<br />\n<br />\nIn 2012, Saroo embarked on a trip from Australia back to Khandwa, India. Once he arrived, he shared his story with locals, who helped him find his way back home to his mother and surviving brother and sister. Twenty-six years after accidentally leaving home, he finally found his way back.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wL1BwQORuKg/UlzGRm9n9BI/AAAAAAAANUI/KO6IYsKxWDY/s1600/1SUunIIJ2bRxbppAqFyEfgMzmRkDmEA1rVHBR.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"412\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wL1BwQORuKg/UlzGRm9n9BI/AAAAAAAANUI/KO6IYsKxWDY/s640/1SUunIIJ2bRxbppAqFyEfgMzmRkDmEA1rVHBR.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>The Google Earth imagery that brought Saroo home.</i></div><br />\nMaps can affect our lives in many ways, big and small\u2014but hopefully they always help us find our way.

We want to work across multiple screens\u2014often at the same time. We want the latest and greatest software and we want to be able to get to our stuff from wherever we are. Chromebooks offer all of that, making computers that are simpler, more secure and more affordable, for everyone.   <br />\n<br />\nEarlier today, <a href=\"http://h20435.www2.hp.com/t5/The-Next-Bench-Blog/HP-Chromebook11-Made-with-Google/ba-p/83539\">HP introduced</a> the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/hp-chromebook-11/\">HP Chromebook 11</a>. Designed and built in partnership with our friends at HP, it has all of the speed, simplicity and security benefits you'd expect from a Chromebook, and some unique design elements that address many of the challenges people face with computers today.   <br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X7QisoutXqw/UlP6Ay1KqrI/AAAAAAAAAEk/JegQruRExZ8/s1600/8_HP_Chromebook_11_Color_Stack.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"213\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X7QisoutXqw/UlP6Ay1KqrI/AAAAAAAAAEk/JegQruRExZ8/s320/8_HP_Chromebook_11_Color_Stack.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />\nFirst, a laptop should be light and mobile. So the new Chromebook is really thin with no extra fluff. It weighs in at just over two pounds\u2014one of the lightest laptops on the market. There are also no sharp edges so nothing digs into your wrists while you type. And when you\u2019re traveling, you don\u2019t need to throw an extra charger into your bag. The HP Chromebook 11 is powered by a micro-USB charger, which can also be used to juice up your Android phone or tablet.   <br />\n<br />\nSecond, a computer should look good\u2014something you\u2019re proud to take out at a coffee shop. So the new Chromebook has a sleek, distinctive and super simple look. The fanless design means it doesn\u2019t need any grills for venting. And it comes in a variety of colors to match your mood (or your wardrobe).   <br />\n<br />\nAnd there are a bunch of other things that we hope will make your computing experience even more awesome: <br />\n<ul><li><b>Brilliant display</b>. Often when folks gather around a screen, everyone tries to gently nudge the computer in their own direction so they can see better. No more nudging. The new Chromebook's screen has a 176-degree viewing angles so you can see even when looking at it almost completely sideways. And the super bright display brings all of your favorite photos, shows and videos to life. </li>\n<li><b>Light but sturdy</b>. We wanted the Chromebook to hold up well against everyday bumps and bruises. So it has a magnesium frame that makes it incredibly sturdy. You can hold it from a single corner without it bending or flexing. </li>\n<li><b>Finely-tuned speakers</b>. Many computers have speakers on the bottom, which is great if you have ears in your lap. Instead, the speakers on the new Chromebook are under the keyboard, which means the sound is crisp, clear and pointed up towards your ears.</li>\n<li><b>Goodies built-in</b>. And, of course, many Google apps come built-in, including 100GB of Google Drive cloud storage (free for two years) and a 60-day free trial of Google Play Music All Access.</li>\n</ul><br />\nThis Chromebook is crafted with the same obsessive attention to detail as the Chromebook Pixel. But we worked hard with HP to keep the price low: the new HP Chromebook 11 is available for just $279.   <br />\n<br />\nLook for it starting today at Best Buy, Amazon, Google Play and HP Shopping in the U.S., as well as at Currys, PC World and many other retailers in the U.K. It will be available in other countries that sell Chromebooks in time for the holidays.   <br />\n<br />\nSo if you\u2019ve been looking for a computer that makes it easier to get stuff done (and look good doing it), we hope you give the new HP Chromebook 11 a try\u2014or add it to your <a href=\"http://g.co/giveachromebook\">gift list</a> this holiday season.

Transistors <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/physics/transistor/history/\">performed a similar function electronically</a>, but generated less heat and were a fraction of the size, allowing machines to be made that were both smaller and more powerful.  <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.zemanek.at/\">Heinz</a> <a href=\"http://purl.umn.edu/107723\">Zemanek</a>, then an assistant professor at the <a href=\"http://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/\">Vienna University of Technology</a>, had long been interested in computers. In 1956, he enlisted a team of students to build one based on this new transistor technology.  <br />\n<br />\nZemanek\u2019s project didn\u2019t have university backing, so the team relied on donations. One student\u2019s work was sponsored by <a href=\"http://www.zib.de/zuse/home.php/Main/KonradZuse\">Konrad Zuse</a>, the German computer pioneer, on the understanding he would join Zuse\u2019s company after completing his doctorate. Additional money came from an Austrian bankers association, thanks to connections Zemanek had made through his role leading <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_and_Girl_Guides_of_Austria\">Austria\u2019s Boy Scouts</a>. Overall more than 35 companies contributed materials, in particular <a href=\"http://www.philips.com/about/company/history/index.page\">Philips</a>, who donated all the transistors and diodes.  The only drawback was the transistors were relatively slow, originally designed for hearing aids.<br />\n<br />\nAt the time, leading U.S. machines were named after types of wind, such as MIT\u2019s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlwind_I\">Whirlwind</a> and RCA Laboratory\u2019s <a href=\"http://blog.modernmechanix.com/navy-brain-answers-with-pictures/\">Typhoon</a>. In a gentle nod to this, Zemanek nicknamed his computer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail%C3%BCfterl\">Mail\u00fcfterl</a>, meaning \u201cMay Breeze.\u201d  <a href=\"http://invention.smithsonian.org/downloads/fa_cohc_tr_zema721212.pdf\">As he joked</a>&nbsp;(PDF): \"We are not going to produce\u2026 any of those big American storms, but we will have a very nice little Viennese spring breeze!\u201d <br />\n<br />\nOn May 27, 1958 the Mail\u00fcfterl ran its first calculation and became mainland Europe\u2019s first fully transistorized computer\u2014and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transistorized_computers\">one of the earliest in the world</a>.  It remained at the university for its first few years, financed in part by the European Research Office of the American Army.  In 1960 Zemanek signed a contract with IBM, and in September 1961 the Mail\u00fcfterl was moved to a new research laboratory in Vienna that IBM created for Zemanek and his team.  <br />\n<br />\nToday the Mail\u00fcfterl is on display at the <a href=\"http://www.technischesmuseum.at/language/en-us/home\">Technical Museum in Vienna</a>\u2014a fitting reminder of Austria\u2019s time at the vanguard of European computing. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Wolfgang Fasching-Kapfenberger, Communications &amp; Public Affairs Manager, Austria</span>", "id": "6564604319334791566", "updated": "2013-10-01T01:00:06-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["computing history", "Europe"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/6564604319334791566/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-10-01T01:00:00-07:00", "title": "An Austrian star of European computing"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/09/igniting-new-network-meet-our-tech-hub.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzgwMTI1ODE2MjQ2Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/4293183186855817302", "content": "Over the past few years, tech hubs have sprung up in cities across the globe, making it possible to start a high-growth company from almost anywhere, not just London or Silicon Valley.

But did you know that every year approximately five new constitutions are written, and 20-30 are amended or revised? Or that Africa has the youngest set of constitutions, with 19 out of the 39 constitutions written globally since 2000 from the region?  <br />\n<br />\nThe process of redesigning and drafting a new constitution can play a critical role in uniting a country, especially following periods of conflict and instability. In the past, it\u2019s been difficult to access and compare existing constitutional documents and language\u2014which is critical to drafters\u2014because the texts are locked up in libraries or on the hard drives of constitutional experts. Although the process of drafting constitutions has evolved from chisels and stone tablets to pens and modern computers, there has been little innovation in how their content is sourced and referenced. <br />\n<br />\nWith this in mind, <a href=\"http://google.com/ideas\">Google Ideas</a> supported the <a href=\"http://www.comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/\">Comparative Constitutions Project</a> to build <a href=\"https://www.constituteproject.org/#/\">Constitute</a>, a new site that digitizes and makes searchable the world\u2019s constitutions. Constitute enables people to browse and search constitutions via curated and tagged topics, as well as by country and year. The Comparative Constitutions Project cataloged and tagged nearly 350 themes, so people can easily find and compare specific constitutional material. This ranges from the fairly general, such as \u201cCitizenship\u201d and \u201cForeign Policy,\u201d to the very specific, such as \u201cSuffrage and turnouts\u201d and \u201cJudicial Autonomy and Power.\u201d <br />\n<br />\nOur aim is to arm drafters with a better tool for constitution design and writing. We also hope citizens will use Constitute to learn more about their own constitutions, and those of countries around the world.<br />\n<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/b0BsJuN0OAs\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Sara \u201cScout\u201d Sinclair Brody, Google Ideas Product Manager</span>", "id": "2244472770339663063", "updated": "2013-09-23T07:27:34-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/2244472770339663063/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-09-23T07:27:00-07:00", "title": "Explore the world\u2019s constitutions with a new online tool "}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/09/another-windy-day-in-texas-new-power.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzc5NDc3MTExNjQ0Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/5557005942245679532", "content": "As part of our quest to power our operations with 100% renewable energy, we\u2019ve agreed to purchase the entire output of the 240 MW Happy Hereford wind farm outside of Amarillo, Texas. This agreement represents our fifth long-term agreement and our largest commitment yet; we\u2019ve now contracted for more than 570 MW of wind energy, which is enough energy to power approximately 170,000 U.S. households.<br />\n<br />\nThe Happy Hereford wind farm, which is expected to start producing energy in late 2014, is being developed by <a href=\"http://chermacenergy.com/\">Chermac Energy</a>, a small, Native American-owned company based in Oklahoma.

Due to the current structure of the market, we can\u2019t consume the renewable energy produced by the wind farm directly, but the impact on our overall carbon footprint and the amount of renewable energy on the grid is the same as if we could consume it. After purchasing the renewable energy, we\u2019ll retire the renewable energy credits (RECs) and sell the energy itself to the wholesale market. We\u2019ll apply any additional RECs produced under this agreement to reduce our carbon footprint elsewhere.<br />\n<br />\nThis type of power purchase agreement represents one of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/green/energy/use/#purchasing\">several ways</a> we\u2019re working to make additional renewable energy available for both our data centers and the communities in which we operate. In Scandinavia, due to the region\u2019s unified power market and grid system, we\u2019re able to <a href=\"http://googlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/powering-our-finnish-data-center-with.html\">purchase wind energy in Sweden</a> and directly consume it at our Hamina, Finland data center.  We\u2019re also working with our local utility partners to develop new options. In 2012, we signed an agreement with GRDA, our utility partner in Oklahoma, to <a href=\"http://googlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2012/09/more-renewable-energy-for-our-data.html\">green the energy supply</a> to our Oklahoma data center with 48 MW of wind energy from the Canadian Hills Wind Project.

Hear how HALO is using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/enterprise/mapsearth/?utm_source=halo9162013&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=entblog\">Google Maps for Business</a> to fight the war against mines, clearing more than 1.4 million landmines worldwide. </i>-Ed.<br />\n<br />\nWhen conflicts end, making communities safe and livable often means removing dangerous remnants of war. \u201cGetting mines out of the ground, for good,\u201d as we say at the HALO Trust, has been our mission over the last 25 years. We work in more than a dozen countries and regions across the globe, clearing landmines and other explosives, many of which have been buried underground. While we\u2019ve been in operation for almost three decades, there is still more to be done.  <br />\n<br />\nIn Kosovo, where people are reclaiming their homeland after the conflict in 1999, we\u2019re working in close cooperation with the government and local population to collect and share information about where mines are located. It\u2019s a true community effort\u2014farmers tell us where they\u2019ve seen signs of mines and where accidents have occurred. It\u2019s our job at the HALO Trust to take this data and make it usable, accessible, and visually compelling, so clearance becomes more efficient and happens faster.<br />\n<br />\nOne of our biggest challenges is keeping our field teams safe. We need easy-to-use tools that can help us find, map and clear hazardous areas without putting our operations at risk. Over the years, we\u2019ve continuously improved our mine clearance techniques, including the deployment of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/enterprise/mapsearth/products/earthpro.html\">Google Earth Pro</a>.<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/mCl0T0PFxgk\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\n<br />\nGoogle Earth Pro makes it easier for the HALO team to do the dangerous and detailed work of finding and mapping at-risk areas. Because it\u2019s based on the same technology as Google Maps and Earth, it\u2019s easy for our teams to use and create maps without IT or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system\">GIS</a> expertise. It\u2019s a tool that is familiar to our employees and something they use in their daily lives, so we can start mapping right away.<br />\n<br />\nThe information we gather, including GPS references to landmines in the field, is imported into Earth Pro so that we can plot mine locations. We also use the incredibly detailed satellite imagery in Google Earth to identify and map hazardous areas. These high-resolution maps serve many people: from families who live near mines, to crews who clear them, and donors and other organizations that support us. When donors view the vivid interactive maps of our project areas\u2014with mines so close to schools, farms and houses\u2014they understand why the HALO Trust\u2019s work is so critical.<br />\n<br />\nAccurate maps from Google Earth Pro mean safer working conditions for our local teams, and faster progress toward our goals. In Kosovo alone, we\u2019ve removed thousands of landmines, cluster munitions and other explosives. And with the help of Google\u2019s mapping tools and our donors, we\u2019ll be able to declare the country mine-free.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Guy Willoughby, Executive Director, the HALO Trust</span>", "id": "3794038378453216470", "updated": "2014-09-23T09:43:10-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["google for work", "maps and earth"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/3794038378453216470/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-09-16T00:00:00-07:00", "title": "The HALO Trust: Helping communities reclaim the land with Google Maps for Business "}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/09/explore-galapagos-biodiversity-with.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzc5MDExODAyNjE1Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/2650961977508043133", "content": "This week marks the 178th anniversary of Darwin\u2019s first exploration of the Galapagos Islands.

Their politically charged lyrics combined with their hunger for new rhythms gave them an unparalleled ability to create music that made you think as well as dance. They embraced all genres while still sounding like themselves and redefined what a rock group could accomplish musically, politically and culturally. <br />\n<br />\nFrom the reggae-inspired social commentary of tracks like \u201cWhite Man in Hammersmith Palais,\u201d to hip-hop infused cuts like \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d and even Top 40 hits such as \u201cRock the Casbah,\u201d their <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/music/album?id=Bgkypnhu5euejjouimttlkewfma\">songs</a> gave a generation a lifelong connection not just to the Clash, but to music in general.<br />\n<br />\nFrom time to time, Google Play <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irElqdYUfZs\">teams up with iconic rockers</a> to help tell their stories. When we heard that the Clash were planning to re-release some of their greatest music, we wanted to celebrate their legacy and create something cool for their fans around the world. They handed over hours of unseen footage of the late Joe Strummer discussing the arc of the band\u2019s career. And the Google Play team interviewed the rest of the members to get their perspective on what they accomplished and how they did it. The result is \u201cAudio Ammunition,\u201d a free, five-part documentary about the Clash that walks through the writing, recording and reception of each of their classic studio albums. <br />\n<br />\nWatch part one of the documentary on <a href=\"http://play.google.com/store/music/collection/promotion_20002d7_vid_clash_doc\">Google Play</a>, and you can check out the other four parts on our YouTube channel at <a href=\"http://youtube.com/googleplay\">youtube.com/googleplay</a>. You can also buy all five of their newly released, digitally remastered albums on Google Play. And because the Clash\u2019s legacy continues to inspire musicians today, we\u2019ve produced some exclusive cover versions by contemporary artists we admire. These four tracks are available as free downloads for a limited time on Google Play.<br />\n<br />\nThe Clash explored a world of ever-expanding rhythms and possibilities and the urgency and power of their music still resonates today. As bassist Paul Simonon says. \u201cWe weren\u2019t concerned with playing just on our doorstep. It was to play on any doorstep, throughout the world.\u201d<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/16-WktpcHpI\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Tim Quirk, head of content programming for Google Play</span>", "id": "3956245276650009866", "updated": "2013-09-10T07:50:19-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["google play"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/3956245276650009866/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-09-09T23:30:00-07:00", "title": "Get that world to listen: Celebrating the Clash, an iconic band"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/09/just-reflektor-virtual-projection-with.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxNDI0MjI0ODEyMDMwCm9mZnNldDogLTI4ODAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/7212175006373548227", "content": "Since Chrome <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html\">launched</a> in 2008, we\u2019ve been <a href=\"http://www.chromeexperiments.com/\">experimenting</a> with new ways to tell stories on the web using 3D graphics, immersive sound effects and more.

Sometimes the thief will change your password so you can't get back into your own account\u2014kind of like someone stealing your keys and then changing the lock. <br />\n<br />\nIf you've lost your Google password, you need a way to get back into your Google Account\u2014and back to all of your stuff in Gmail, Maps, Google+ and YouTube. To help you, Google needs to be able to tell that you\u2019re the rightful account owner even if you don't have the right password.

It's like the \"fast lane\" for account recovery: we text a code to the phone number you've registered with us, and you're <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/183728?hl=en\">back in business</a> in no time. Your phone is more secure and reliable than other means of recovering your account.  Methods like \u201csecret\u201d questions (asking your mother\u2019s maiden name or city where you were born) may have answers that are easy to remember, but they are also possible for bad guys to uncover. And we\u2019ve consistently seen that people who register a recovery phone are faster and more successful at getting their accounts back than those recovering their accounts via email. <br />\n<br />\nYou can also get a text message if Google detects that something suspicious is going on with your account. Giving a recovery phone number to Google won\u2019t result in you being signed up for marketing lists or getting more calls from telemarketers.<br />\n<br />\n<b>3. Keep your recovery options up to date. </b>It\u2019s a good idea to check your recovery options every so often. For example, if you change your phone number after setting up your recovery options, take just a minute to update your recovery settings to match. We'll remind you of your current settings every so often to make it easier for you to keep them up to date. <br />\n<br />\nThat\u2019s it! You can either update your recovery options next time you\u2019re prompted, or you can take two minutes to do it right now on our <a href=\"http://accounts.google.com/UpdateAccountRecoveryOptions\">Account recovery options page</a>.

But my internship was special for reasons beyond the Hollywood notoriety that accompanied my arrival to Mountain View. One of those reasons was the active presence of Google\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.google.com/diversity/\">Employee Resource Groups</a> (ERGs) and how welcoming they\u2019ve been to interns. <br />\n<br />\nOpen to Googlers everywhere, ERGs are grassroots networks with shared values of supporting diversity and inclusion throughout our company and our communities. Surprised to discover that 20+ unique ERGs existed to begin with, I was relieved when I found out that interns, who are treated like full-time Googlers, could participate in them as well.<br />\n<br />\nFrom ice cream socials to BBQs and salsa dancing, ERGs gave us opportunities to get to know Googlers from different seniority levels and functions\u2014while having fun! The events I attended brought interns together with entry-level Googlers, managers, directors and senior VPs; Googlers in sales, marketing, people operations, global business, small business (SMB) services and engineering. <br />\n<br />\nWhile many ERG events are social, Googlers in these groups also have a deep impact on social issues and the company at large. In light of the DOMA decision in June, Gayglers rallied the entire office for San Francisco\u2019s Pride parade. Some of my fellow interns described the parade as a highlight. Shawn Saunders, a senior at Brown University and SMB services intern, told me \u201cthrough the Gayglers, I was able to find a community of queer and allied Googlers who really helped color my experiences at Google.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p6q2dAMxBnE/UiYlmAQz-WI/AAAAAAAANIM/sLlLxyklUtc/s1600/17o460UbSMlCRN1AluR_yNzGa3CO6RuJa3LtX.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"298\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p6q2dAMxBnE/UiYlmAQz-WI/AAAAAAAANIM/sLlLxyklUtc/s400/17o460UbSMlCRN1AluR_yNzGa3CO6RuJa3LtX.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n<span id=\"goog_1639818080\"></span><span id=\"goog_1639818081\"></span><br />\nThe Special Needs Network engaged interns in this summer\u2019s Disability Pride Parade.

You can lock your device with a pin, password, pattern (or even <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l4D2tn_-kQ\">your face</a>!) by going to Settings &gt; Personal &gt; Security &gt; Screen Lock.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JqKMEYHEfjY/UfvZcNdwbII/AAAAAAAAM2c/JDPO2Uke1LU/s1600/ScreenLock.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JqKMEYHEfjY/UfvZcNdwbII/AAAAAAAAM2c/JDPO2Uke1LU/s400/ScreenLock.png\" width=\"238\" /></a></div>\n<b>2. Protect your phone from suspicious apps. </b>We automatically scan Google Play to block and remove harmful apps. That makes Google Play the safest place to get Android apps. But Google Play can also help <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/2812853?hl=en\">protect you</a> even for apps you get elsewhere, like the web or a third-party app store. The first time you start to install an app from an unknown source, a message will pop up asking if you\u2019d like Google to scan the file to make sure it\u2019s not harmful. Tap \u201cOK\u201d to let Google help protect you from harmful apps.<br />\n<br />\n<b>3. Locate, ring and wipe a misplaced device. </b>Have you ever lost your phone in between the couch cushions or left it in a restaurant? Later this month, you will be able to use a new service called Android Device Manager, which can quickly ring your phone at maximum volume so you can find it (even if it\u2019s been silenced), or locate it on a map, in real time, using Android Device Manager. If your phone can\u2019t be recovered, or has been stolen, you can quickly and securely erase all of the data on your device to keep your data from ending up in the wrong hands. The Android Device Manager will be available for devices running Android 2.2 and above, as part of Google Play.

It works across platforms\u2014Android tablets and smartphones, iPhones, iPads, Chrome for Mac and Windows (more to come), so your personal device is also now your remote control.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Cast the web to your TV</b><br />\nIn addition to apps like Netflix, you can use Chromecast to bring a broad range of content available on the web to your big screen, thanks to a new feature in the Chrome browser that allows you to project any browser tab to your TV. From sharing your family photos to enjoying a video clip from your favorite news site, it\u2019s as simple as pressing a button. This feature is launching in beta, but we\u2019re excited for people to try it out and give us their feedback.<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/cKG5HDyTW8o\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\n<b>Google Cast SDK preview for developers</b><br />\nTo ensure a great Chromecast experience over time, we've built Google Cast, a technology that enables developers to build consistent, intuitive multi-screen experiences across mobile devices and TVs.

The first thing you\u2019ll notice is the sharpness of the screen: the 323 pixels packed into every inch of the screen makes it the world's highest-resolution 7-inch tablet. It\u2019s lighter than ever, with more than nine hours of HD video playback and 10 hours of web browsing or reading. Nexus 7 now features stereo speakers and virtual surround sound from Fraunhofer (the inventors of the MP3 format), giving you rich and immersive audio.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Android 4.3\u2014a sweeter Jelly Bean</b><br />\nNexus 7 is the first device to ship with <a href=\"http://www.android.com/about/jelly-bean/\">Android 4.3</a>, the newest version of Android. Tablets are perfect for sharing with others, so in Android 4.3, we're introducing restricted profiles, which let you limit access to apps and content. For example, restricted profiles enable parental controls, so certain family members are prevented from accessing mature content. Likewise, retail stores can use tablets to show off product information, and shops can use tablets as point of sale systems. Android 4.3 also now supports <a href=\"http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart-Devices.aspx\">Bluetooth Smart</a> technology, opening the door to mobile apps that connect to new devices like fitness sensors. Android 4.3 is rolling out to Nexus devices starting today.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Ready to Play</b><br />\nThe new <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.play.games\">Google Play Games</a> app brings your friends together with the games you love, where you can invite a friend and start challenging gamers around the world, compete for top achievements, and race to the top of the leaderboard. You can also enjoy the world\u2019s largest collection of eBooks, listen to millions of music tracks and immerse yourself in thousands of movies, TV shows, magazines and apps on Google Play. Plus, Nexus 7 comes loaded with your favorite Google apps, like Chrome, Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Now. <br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5LysTmwDan8\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\n<b>How to get Chromecast and the new Nexus 7</b><br />\nStarting today, the Chromecast device is available for $35 on Google Play, Amazon.com and BestBuy.com.

Many of these entrepreneurs refer to their start-ups as their \u201cbaby,\u201d and it\u2019s easy to understand why. Like having a newborn, a start-up is super-exciting, yet the days are hectic and the nights are... sleepless. <br />\n<br />\nWhat\u2019s really inspiring (and just a little bit crazy) is that some people do both at the same time. Take, for example, Israeli entrepreneur <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Yazamiyot/members/10613255/\">Hilla Brenner</a>, who raised $5 million for her first start-up when she was nine months pregnant. Earlier this year, I had the chance to meet Hilla and we began talking about how juggling work and kids doesn\u2019t leave much time to invest in learning and developing new skills. We also discussed how maternity leave can be one of the few times when women can stop and think about their career. We asked ourselves: what could we do to help women with young children get access to self-development and career support and, in doing so, to help more women become tech entrepreneurs? <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.google.com/entrepreneurs/initiatives/campus-tlv-moms.html\">Campus for Moms</a> is a baby-friendly start-up school for new moms, run by Google in partnership with <a href=\"http://yazamiyot.com/\">Yazamiyot</a>, a networking group for Israeli women entrepreneurs. The first course, which ended this week, included nine sessions led by successful entrepreneurs, investors, technology experts and others. The sessions covered personal success stories, finance, legal and presentation skills, and tech knowledge, like cloud computing. We arranged mattresses, bean bags and diaper-changing facilities so that the moms could take care of their young ones during the sessions. Four babies were born during the course and one new mum returned to the program less than a week after giving birth! <br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/I7QBrFShv8o\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\nAt the end of the course, participants presented their initiatives to venture capital funds and the course speakers. Their ideas are exciting\u2014including a platform for teachers to create apps for their students, a <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Fash-Tech/\">fashion-tech meet up</a> to encourage cooperation between local fashion-related start-ups, a 2G mobile ecommerce gateway for emerging markets and a bunch of other great initiatives. <br />\n<br />\nThe participants are continuing to develop their skills: two of the start-ups have joined the <a href=\"http://www.campustelaviv.com/programs/\">Campus Tel Aviv \u201cLaunch Pad\u201d</a> program, an intensive week-long bootcamp for entrepreneurs, and another will be visiting <a href=\"http://www.campuslondon.com/\">Campus London</a> to meet with U.K.-based entrepreneurs. <br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UxxculE7Lnc/UebHE2G77FI/AAAAAAAAMyw/cLEDxBNnZP0/s1600/1GXCNvboh13AIKXIWTOX_A2JE67X8u824F2Xa8A.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UxxculE7Lnc/UebHE2G77FI/AAAAAAAAMyw/cLEDxBNnZP0/s640/1GXCNvboh13AIKXIWTOX_A2JE67X8u824F2Xa8A.jpeg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\nThe first course of \u201cCampus for Moms\u201d is over, but we\u2019re gearing up for <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/1KBsWY1Qa75EreAamzQcXC1vV_yMLKQ9ijPtHhDcJcL0/viewform\">another course</a> in October.

These features will no longer be a part of the new Google Maps app, and will stop functioning in older versions by August 9.

More details about Latitude and check-in changes can be found in our <a href=\"http://support.google.com/gmm/?p=maps_android_latitude\">help center</a>. <br />\n<br />\nThe offline maps feature for Android is also no longer available. Instead we\u2019ve created a new way for you to access maps offline by simply entering \u201cOK Maps\u201d into the search box when viewing the area you want for later. Finally, My Maps functionality is not supported in this release but will return to future versions of the app. People who want to create powerful custom maps can still do so with <a href=\"http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2013/03/create-collaborate-and-share-advanced.html\">Maps Engine Lite</a> on desktop.<br />\n<br />\nHelping you find great places is what we love to do.

Knowing how to stay safe and secure online is important, which is why we created our Good to Know site with advice and tips for safe and savvy Internet use.</i> -Ed.<br />\n<br />\nSummer is here, and with kids out of school it is a great time for families to explore the web together\u2014from learning what makes fireflies glow to playing online games together. But while there is a lot of entertaining, educational content online, there are also materials I\u2019d rather not see when I\u2019m surfing the web with my family. Google has built a number of tools that parents can use to help keep content they would rather not see from popping up on the family computer. It takes less than five minutes to turn them on, so follow the steps below to help make your search results more family-friendly this summer. <br />\n<br />\n<b>1. Turn on SafeSearch in Google Search</b><br />\nTurning on <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/510?hl=en#\">SafeSearch</a> is an easy way to help you hide images, search results and videos intended just for adults. It\u2019s especially helpful if you\u2019re concerned about the content that might pop up on your family computer, and it\u2019s easy to turn on. Just visit the Google <a href=\"http://www.google.com/preferences\">Search Settings page</a>, go to the \"SafeSearch filters\" section, and check the box to filter mature content from Google Search result pages. These preferences will apply for any searches done using that browser on your computer. If you have multiple browsers on your family computer, you might want to turn SafeSearch on for each one.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j_1JZ5ZCDdE/UdwvAk8nWHI/AAAAAAAAMto/Z01kSWmfhlk/s1600/safesearch.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j_1JZ5ZCDdE/UdwvAk8nWHI/AAAAAAAAMto/Z01kSWmfhlk/s1600/safesearch.jpeg\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>You can turn SafeSearch on or off from the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/preferences\">Search Settings page</a></i></div><br />\n<b>2. Save and lock your preferences</b><br />\nOnce you\u2019ve set your preferences, make sure to click the Save button at the bottom of the page. And if you're signed in to your Google Account, you can also lock the SafeSearch filter so others can\u2019t change your preferences\u2014just click \u201cLock SafeSearch.\u201d Now the setting is protected with your Google Account password. While no filter is 100 percent perfect, with SafeSearch on you can feel more confident browsing the web with your family. <br />\n<br />\n<b>3. Turn on YouTube Safety Mode </b><br />\n<a href=\"http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=174084\">YouTube Safety Mode</a> helps you and your family avoid videos that might be OK with our <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a>, but you might not want popping up on your family computer. Turning on Safety Mode in YouTube takes just one step. Scroll down to the bottom of any YouTube page and click on the button that says \u201cSafety\u201d at the bottom of the page\u2014now you can choose your preferences for Safety Mode. <br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RYlMiqP3_-w/UdwvBPDkakI/AAAAAAAAMt4/BhUVjWf1S-M/s1600/youtube+safety.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"366\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RYlMiqP3_-w/UdwvBPDkakI/AAAAAAAAMt4/BhUVjWf1S-M/s640/youtube+safety.jpeg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Click the button that says \u201cSafety\u201d at the bottom of any YouTube page, and then choose your preferences</i></div><br />\n<b>4. Lock your Safety Mode preferences</b><br />\nJust like with Safe Search, you can also log in with your Google Account and <a href=\"http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=174084\">lock YouTube Safety Mode</a> on each one of your computer\u2019s browsers. It will filter videos with mature content, so they won\u2019t show up in video search results, related videos, playlists, shows or films. YouTube Safety Mode will also help hide objectionable comments.<br />\n<br />\n<b>5. Turn on SafeSearch on mobile</b><br />\nSafeSearch is available on your phone or other mobile device, as well as the web. You can turn on SafeSearch for Google on your mobile device by opening your phone\u2019s browser and visiting <a href=\"http://google.com/preferences\">google.com/preferences</a>. Scroll to the SafeSearch Filters section to select what level of filtering you would like to enable. Be sure to tap \u201cSave Preferences\u201d after you\u2019ve made your selection. <br />\n<br />\nTo enable SafeSearch on YouTube\u2019s mobile app, first open your settings, then press \u201cSearch.\u201d From there, select \u201cSafeSearch Filtering\u201d and select moderate or strict filtering. <br />\n<br />\nHelping your family have a positive and safe experience with Google is important to you, and it\u2019s important to us, too. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve partnered with parents and experts on free and easy to use tools and resources to help your family stay safe and secure when browsing online. If you\u2019re interested in even more of our tools and tips, please see our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/goodtoknow/\">Good to Know</a> site, and stay tuned for more security tips throughout the summer.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Matthias Heiler, Staff Software Engineer</span>", "id": "4306710749302486847", "updated": "2013-07-09T11:54:07-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["online safety", "security and safety tips"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/4306710749302486847/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-07-09T09:00:00-07:00", "title": "A few easy tools the whole family will love"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/07/a-new-way-to-experience-100th-tour-de.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzczMzA2NDA1NjE2Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/3091056078098856709", "content": "This year, the Tour de France is celebrating its 100th edition with a special route, from Corsica to Les Champs-Elys\u00e9es, giving people around the world the chance to admire beautiful sights as well as amazing athletic feats. <br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/the-100th-tour-de-france\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eYfWoW0MXF4/Udr17vkOloI/AAAAAAAAMr4/0do26RSJS_Y/s1600/1Ey7tojukAAjHsR5W0vWsgR0onYjQwpoxtoe5.gif\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>Our recent Doodle celebrating the 100th edition of the Tour de France</i></div>\n<br />\nThe Tour de France is using a variety of Google products to help you experience the race like never before, including a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/letourdefrance\">YouTube channel</a>, a <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+LeTourDeFrance/posts\">Google+ page</a> and an <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aso.tdf2012int\">Android app</a> where you can keep up with this 100th edition.

Last year, more than 1 million campers joined in, and this summer is looking even brighter. Maker Camp will officially kick off at 11 a.m. PDT / 2 p.m. EDT today in a live <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/1/events/c4ofgr2dgpjpql4t2njondc05ig\">Hangout On Air</a> from San Francisco\u2019s Exploratorium and will go on for the next six weeks.  - Ed.</i><br />\n<br />\nCamping has long been a summer tradition that calls us to explore the outdoors, engage in fun activities and make new friends. Overnight camping might involve setting up tents and gathering around a campfire, while day camps can focus on areas of interest such as chess, computers, robotics or sports (we\u2019ve worked with a lot of these at Maker Media). Yet no matter what kind of camp it is, or where it takes place, camp has to be fun and social. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/1/+MAKE/posts\">Maker Camp</a> is a whole new kind of camp: an online summer camp that is completely free and open to everyone. Maker Camp takes place wherever you are, by letting you do fun activities and share them with others through the Google+ platform. You\u2019ll make cool projects, go on epic virtual \u201cfield trips\u201d and meet awesome makers. <br />\n<br />\nThis is Maker Camp\u2019s second summer, and the format is similar: Each weekday morning, we\u2019ll post a new project or activity on our Google+ page\u201430 things to make over six weeks. Each weekday afternoon, tune in to a live Google+ Hangout On Air to meet expert makers who create amazing things. And like last year, our Field Trip Friday Hangouts will take you to new places that few of us get to see. For instance, we\u2019re excited to take you to NASA Ames Research Center next week, and this week we\u2019ll be checking out one of the world\u2019s fastest sailboats, from Oracle Team USA. <br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve added a few things to make this year's Maker Camp even better. There's a new <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/107377046073638428310\">Google+ Community for Maker Camp</a>, so it will be even easier for you to chat with other campers and see what they\u2019re working on. We also have a network of affiliate camps (we call them \u201ccampsites\u201d), so you can create and make together in your local library, youth club or makerspace. If there\u2019s a campsite near you, you\u2019ll find it <a href=\"http://makezine.com/maker-camp/affiliate-map/\">on this map</a>. We\u2019ve worked with Google to supply many of these campsites with maker equipment like soldering kits, LEDs, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/1/+raspberrypi/posts\">Raspberry Pi boards</a> (mini Linux computers), and <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/1/+Arduino/posts\">Arduino microcontrollers</a> (good for making robots and other gadgets). <br />\n<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/NkJqM4YOPRA\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\n<br />\nMaker Camp hopes to foster the DIY (do-it-yourself) spirit in young people. We want each camper to see how much there is that you can do and how much there is to explore all around you. Once you begin doing things, you\u2019ll meet others who share your interests, and you can collaborate to work on projects together. We call that DIT (do-it-together). Google+ is a platform for that kind of collaboration, and it extends to any location and any time zone. And when Maker Camp comes to an end, you\u2019ll have friendships that last beyond summer.<br />\n<br />\nMaker Camp might not be surrounded by trees or near a lake, but it has many of the wonderful features of camping. For instance, you can think of your computer as the campfire that we gather around, and with more than a million campers, our virtual campfire is pretty big! Plus, like any camp, you\u2019ll get the most out of Maker Camp by participating.

In other parts of the world, we marched in celebrations in London, Budapest, Dublin, Tel Aviv, and <a href=\"http://www.tokyorainbowweek.jp/\">Tokyo Rainbow Week 2013</a>.

Earlier this year, we worked with Creative Lab to create a grassroots employee video for TheFour.com, an organization supporting marriage equality in the four U.S. states where it was on the ballot this past year. Google also co-wrote an article to the United States Supreme Court explaining why Gay Marriage is Good for Business. We supported the citizens of France by hosting marriage ceremonies over Hangouts and we recently launched a YouTube Spotlight Channel and campaign, #ProudtoLove, dedicated to celebrating LGBT Pride. <br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re proud of all our Googlers and excited about what was accomplished this year!

Privacy and security are important topics\u2014they matter to us, and they matter to you. Building on our Good to Know site with advice for safe and savvy Internet use, we hope this information helps you understand the choices and control that you have over your online information. </i> -Ed.<br />\n<br />\nMore than a quarter of Internet users worldwide <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120404006331/en/Strategy-Analytics-Quarter-Households-Worldwide-Wireless-Home\">use WiFi at home</a> to connect to the web, but many aren't sure how to protect their home network, or why it is important to do so. The best way to think of your home WiFi network is to think of it like your front door: you want a strong lock on both to ensure your safety and security. <br />\n<br />\nWhen data is in transit over an unsecured WiFi network, the information you\u2019re sending or receiving could be intercepted by someone nearby. Your neighbors might also be able to use the network for their own Internet activities, which might slow down your connection. Securing your network can help keep your information safe when you\u2019re connecting wirelessly, and can also help protect the devices that are connected to your network. <br />\n<br />\nIf you\u2019re interested in improving your home WiFi security, the steps below can help make your home network safer.<br />\n<br />\n<b>1. Check to see what kind of home WiFi security you already have. </b><br />\nDo your friends need to enter a password to get on your network when they visit your house for the first time and ask to use your WiFi? If they don\u2019t, your network isn\u2019t as secure as it could be. Even if they do need to enter a password, there are a few different methods of securing your network, and some are better than others. Check what kind of security you have for your network at home by looking at your WiFi settings. Your network will likely either be unsecured, or secured with WEP, WPA or WPA2. WEP is the oldest wireless security protocol, and it\u2019s pretty weak. WPA is better than WEP, but WPA2 is best. <br />\n<br />\n<b>2. Change your network security settings to WPA2.</b><br />\nYour wireless router is the machine that creates the WiFi network. If you don\u2019t have your home network secured with WPA2, you\u2019ll need to access your router\u2019s settings page to make the change. You can check your router\u2019s user manual to figure out how to access this page, or look for instructions online for your specific router. Any device with a WiFi trademark sold since 2006 is required to support WPA2. If you have a router that was made before then, we suggest upgrading to a new router that does offer WPA2. It\u2019s safer and can be much faster. <br />\n<br />\n<b>3. Create a strong password for your WiFi network.</b><br />\nTo secure your network with WPA2, you\u2019ll need to create a password. It\u2019s important that you <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/helping-passwords-better-protect-you.html\">choose a unique password</a>, with a long mix of numbers, letters and symbols so others can\u2019t easily guess it. If you\u2019re in a private space such as your home, it\u2019s OK to write this password down so you can remember it, and keep it somewhere safe so you don\u2019t lose it. You might also need it handy in case your friends come to visit and want to connect to the Internet via your network. Just like you wouldn\u2019t give a stranger a key to your house, you should only give your WiFi password to people you trust. <br />\n<br />\n<b>4. Secure your router too, so nobody can change your settings.</b><br />\nYour router needs its own password, separate from the password you use to secure your network. Routers come without a password, or if they do have one, it\u2019s a simple default password that many online criminals may already know. If you don\u2019t reset your router password, criminals anywhere in the world have an easy way to launch an attack on your network, the data shared on it and the computers connected to your network. For many routers, you can reset the password from the router settings page. Keep this password to yourself, and make it different from the one you use to connect to the WiFi network (as described in step 3). If you make these passwords the same, then anyone who has the password to connect to your network will also be able to change your wireless router settings.<br />\n<br />\n<b>5. If you need help, look up the instructions.</b><br />\nIf you\u2019ve misplaced your router\u2019s manual, type the model number of your base station or router into a search engine\u2014in many cases the info is available online. Otherwise, contact the company that manufactured the router or your Internet Service Provider for assistance.<br />\n<br />\nPlease check out the video below to learn more about the simple but important steps you can take to improve the security of your Internet browsing.<br />\n<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/_WHynHcXm7c\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\n<br />\nFor more advice on how to protect yourself and your family online, visit our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/goodtoknow/\">Good to Know site</a>, and stay tuned for more posts in our security series. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by John Munoz, Technical Program Manager</span><br />\n</div>", "id": "5189439407237830191", "updated": "2016-01-27T10:56:13-08:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["privacy and security", "security and safety tips"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/5189439407237830191/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-06-27T08:01:00-07:00", "title": "Securing your WiFi network"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/only-clear-skies-on-google-maps-and.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzcyMjYyNjAyODA5Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/7586796856446818420", "content": "To celebrate the sunny days of summer (in the northern hemisphere at least), today we're launching new satellite imagery for Google\u2019s mapping products.

This was a flagship moment: the first implementation of the <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/567553/stored-program-concept\">stored program concept</a> that underpins modern computing.  <br />\n<br />\nEarlier computers had their instructions hardwired into their physical design or held externally on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_tape\">punched paper tape</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_cards\">cards</a>.  Reprogramming them to do a different task entailed internal rewiring or altering the physical storage media.  The Baby marked a new computing era, described by some as the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/birth-of-the-computer/4/87\">birth of software</a>,\u201d in which swapping programs was far simpler\u2014requiring only an update to the electronic memory.  Both instructions and data were held in the Baby\u2019s memory and the contents could be altered automatically at electronic speeds during the course of computation.  <br />\n<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/cozcXiSSkwE\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\n<br />\nDeveloped at Manchester University by <a href=\"http://www.computer50.org/mark1/williams.html\">\u201cFreddie\u201d Williams</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kilburn\">Tom Kilburn</a> and <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/baby-changed-the-world-957962\">Geoff Tootill</a>, in size the Baby was anything but: <a href=\"http://www.mosi.org.uk/media/34352414/the%20baby,%20the%20world's%20first%20stored-program%20computer.pdf\">more than 5m long and weighing a tonne</a>&nbsp;(PDF). Its moniker was due to its role as a testbed for the experimental <a href=\"http://www.computer50.org/kgill/williams/williams.html\">Williams-Kilburn tube</a>, a means of storing binary digits (\u201cbits\u201d) using a cathode ray tube. This was a big deal because up until this point, computers had no cost-effective means of storing and flexibly accessing information in electronic form.  <br />\n<br />\nIn technical terms, the Williams-Kilburn tube was the earliest form of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory\">random access memory</a>, or RAM.  The Baby\u2019s memory consisted of one of these tubes, able to store up to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_tube\">1,024 bits</a>\u2014equivalent to just 128 bytes.  In contrast, the average computer today has RAM in multiples of gigabytes, more than a billion times bigger.   <br />\n<br />\nThe Baby was only ever intended to be a proof-of-concept rather than to serve as a useful calculation tool.  So once it had shown the new memory was reliable, attention shifted to building a more powerful and practical machine using the same concepts.  This resulted in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Mark_1\">Manchester Mark 1</a>, which in turn was the model for the Ferranti Mark 1, the world\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/sale.html\">first computer to be sold commercially</a>, in February 1951. <br />\n<br />\nWhile today nothing remains of the original Baby, a <a href=\"http://www.mosi.org.uk/whats-on/meet-baby.aspx\">working replica is on display</a> at the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) in Manchester.

With free online tools, a passion for math and an initial investment of just $10 to register his domain, <a href=\"http://www.hoodamath.com/\">www.hoodamath.com</a> was born. Eventually Michael\u2019s website became popular with more than just his students. So Michael gave <a href=\"http://www.google.com/adsense/start/\">Google AdSense</a> a try as a way to earn money by placing ads next to his content. As word spread and traffic grew, the revenue generated from his site allowed Michael to devote himself full time to Hooda Math. Today, www.hoodamath.com has more than 350 educational games and has had more than 100 million unique visitors to the site. Beyond building a business for himself, Michael is helping students everywhere learn math while having fun. <br />\n<br />\nOver in New York, Roberto Gil designs and builds children\u2019s furniture\u2014loft beds, bunk beds and entire custom rooms. <a href=\"http://www.casakids.com/\">Casa Kids</a>\u2019 furniture is custom designed for the family to grow along with the child. Roberto works out of his Brooklyn workshop and doesn\u2019t sell to large furniture stores, which means the Casa Kids website is an essential tool for him to connect with potential customers. To grow even further, Roberto began using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/ads/compare/?utm_source=awx&amp;utm_medium=ot&amp;utm_campaign=us-en-ot-awx-q213-smbweek_blog\">AdWords</a> in 2010. In the first few months traffic to his site went up 30 percent. Today, two-thirds of his new customers come from Google.

According to a <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/internet_matters\">McKinsey study</a>, small businesses that make use of the web are growing twice as fast as those that aren\u2019t on the web.  That\u2019s because the web is where we go for information and inspiration\u2014from math games to practice over the summer to someone to design and build that perfect bunk bed for your kids. Ninety-seven percent of American Internet users look online for local products and services. Whether we\u2019re on our smartphones, tablets or computers, the web helps us find what we\u2019re looking for.<br />\n<br />\nHere at Google, we see firsthand how the web is helping American businesses grow and thrive. Through our search and advertising programs, businesses like Casa Kids find customers, publishers like Hooda Math earn money from their content, and nonprofits solicit donations and volunteers. These tools are how we make money, and they\u2019re how millions of other U.S. businesses do, too.  <br />\n<br />\nIn 2012, Google's search and advertising tools helped provide <a href=\"http://google.com/economicimpact\">$94 billion of economic activity for more than 1.9 million American businesses</a>\u2014advertisers, publishers and nonprofits. This represents a 17 percent increase from 2011. Check out the impact made in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/economicimpact\">each state</a>, along with stories of local businesses using the web to grow. <br />\n<br />\nWhether it\u2019s building skills or building furniture, Google helps to build businesses. We\u2019re thrilled to be part of such a vibrant industry and are committed to continuing to help make the web work for people and businesses everywhere.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Allan Thygesen, Vice President, Global SMB Sales</span>", "id": "7428360203077489079", "updated": "2013-06-20T10:00:48-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["ads", "small business"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/7428360203077489079/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-06-20T09:00:00-07:00", "title": "America\u2019s businesses are growing.

Chromebooks\u2014a fast, simple, secure laptop that won't break the bank\u2014will now be carried in over 3 times more stores than before, or more than 6,600 stores around the world.  <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RcZbfEqEpDI/Ub9VKRW9JvI/AAAAAAAAMkI/L7uez64cZrE/s1600/walmart.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"50\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RcZbfEqEpDI/Ub9VKRW9JvI/AAAAAAAAMkI/L7uez64cZrE/s200/walmart.png\" width=\"200\" /></a>In addition to Best Buy and Amazon.com, we\u2019re excited to welcome several new retailers to the family. Starting today, Walmart will be making the newest <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/acer-c7-chromebook.html\">Acer Chromebook</a>, which has a 16GB Solid State Drive (SSD), available in approximately 2,800 stores across the U.S., for just $199. Look for Chromebooks coming to the laptop sections of a Walmart near you this summer.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Dw5yWP_ftZQ/Ub9VKRMwabI/AAAAAAAAMkM/6bZuTLhw2qo/s1600/staples.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Dw5yWP_ftZQ/Ub9VKRMwabI/AAAAAAAAMkM/6bZuTLhw2qo/s175/staples.jpeg\" width=\"175\" /></a>And beginning this weekend, Staples will bring a mix of Chromebooks from Acer, HP and Samsung to every store in the U.S.\u2014more than 1,500 in total. You can also purchase via Staples <a href=\"http://www.staples.com/Google-Chromebooks/cat_CL167985\">online</a>, while businesses can purchase through the Staples Advantage B2B program. In the coming months select Office Depot, OfficeMax, and regional chains Fry\u2019s and TigerDirect locations will begin selling Chromebooks.<br />\n<br />\nIn the 10 other markets worldwide where Chromebooks are sold, availability in national retailers continues to expand. In addition to Dixons in the UK, now 116 Tesco stores are selling Chromebooks, as well as all Media Markt and Saturn stores in the Netherlands, FNAC stores in France and Elgiganten stores in Sweden. In Australia, all JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman stores will be carrying Chromebooks for their customers as well. We\u2019re working hard to bring Chromebooks to even more countries later this year.<br />\n<br />\nChromebooks make great computers for everyone in the family\u2014and now you shouldn\u2019t have to look very far to find one.

But like the physical world, there are dark corners on the web where criminal behavior exists.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2011, the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children\u2019s (NCMEC\u2019s) <a href=\"http://www.missingkids.com/cybertipline/\">Cybertipline</a> Child Victim Identification Program reviewed 17.3 million images and videos of suspected child sexual abuse. This is four times more than what their Exploited Children's Division (ECD) saw in 2007. And the number is still growing. Behind these images are real, vulnerable kids who are sexually victimized and victimized further through the distribution of their images.  <br />\n<br />\nIt is critical that we take action as a community\u2014as concerned parents, guardians, teachers and companies\u2014to help combat this problem.<br />\n<br />\nChild sexual exploitation is a global problem that needs a global solution. More than half of the images and videos sent to NCMEC for analysis are found to have been uploaded to U.S. servers from outside the country. With this in mind, we need to sustain and encourage borderless communication between organizations fighting this problem on the ground. For example, NCMEC\u2019s CyberTipline is able to refer reports regarding online child sexual exploitation to 66 countries, helping local law enforcement agencies effectively execute their investigations. <br />\n<br />\nGoogle has been working on fighting child exploitation since as early as 2006 when we joined the <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/coalition-against-child-pornography.html\">Technology Coalition</a>, teaming up with other tech industry companies to develop technical solutions.  Since then, we\u2019ve been providing software and hardware to helping organizations all around the world to fight child abuse images on the web and help locate missing children.  <br />\n<br />\nThere is much more that can be done, and Google is taking our commitment another step further through a $5 million effort to eradicate child abuse imagery online.  Part of this commitment will go to global child protection partners like the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children and the Internet Watch Foundation.  We\u2019re providing additional support to similar heroic organizations in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia and Latin America.  <br />\n<br />\nSince 2008, we\u2019ve used \u201chashing\u201d technology to tag known child sexual abuse images, allowing us to identify duplicate images which may exist elsewhere. Each offending image in effect gets a unique ID that our computers can recognize without humans having to view them again. Recently, we\u2019ve started working to incorporate encrypted \u201cfingerprints\u201d of child sexual abuse images into a cross-industry database.  This will enable companies, law enforcement and charities to better collaborate on detecting and removing these images, and to take action against the criminals. Today we\u2019ve also announced a $2 million Child Protection Technology Fund to encourage the development of ever more effective tools. <br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re in the business of making information widely available, but there\u2019s certain \u201cinformation\u201d that should never be created or found. We can do a lot to ensure it\u2019s not available online\u2014and that when people try to share this disgusting content they are caught and prosecuted.  <br />\n<br />\n<i><b>Update</b> June 17: </i>Clarified language around NCMEC's Child Victim Identification Program and CyberTipline.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Jacquelline Fuller, Director, Google Giving</span>", "id": "1525567116229664339", "updated": "2013-06-17T16:49:52-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/1525567116229664339/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-06-15T22:48:00-07:00", "title": "Our continued commitment to combating child exploitation online"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/introducing-project-loon.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzcxMjY2MjE0Mzc3Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/8808737415648973312", "content": "The Internet is one of the most transformative technologies of our lifetimes.  But for 2 out of every 3 people on earth, a fast, affordable Internet connection is still out of reach.  And this is far from being a solved problem. <br />\n<p>There are many terrestrial challenges to Internet connectivity\u2014jungles, archipelagos, mountains. There are also major cost challenges. Right now, for example, in most of the countries in the southern hemisphere, the cost of an Internet connection is more than a month\u2019s income. <br />\n<p>Solving these problems isn\u2019t simply a question of time: it requires looking at the problem of access from new angles. So today we\u2019re unveiling our latest <a href=\"https://www.solveforx.com/about/whatisamoonshot/\">moonshot</a> from Google[x]: balloon-powered Internet access.  <br />\n<p><iframe width=\"650\" height=\"366\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/m96tYpEk1Ao\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />\n<p>We believe that it might actually be possible to build a ring of balloons, flying around the globe on the stratospheric winds, that provides Internet access to the earth below.  It\u2019s very early days, but we\u2019ve built a system that uses balloons, carried by the wind at altitudes twice as high as commercial planes, to beam Internet access to the ground at speeds similar to today\u2019s 3G networks or faster. As a result, we hope balloons could become an option for connecting rural, remote, and underserved areas, and for helping with communications after natural disasters.  The idea may sound a bit crazy\u2014and that\u2019s part of the reason we\u2019re calling it <a href=\"http://www.google.com/loon\">Project Loon</a>\u2014but there\u2019s solid science behind it.<br />\n<p><iframe width=\"650\" height=\"366\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mcw6j-QWGMo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />\n<p>Balloons, with all their effortless elegance, present some challenges. Many projects have looked at high-altitude platforms to provide Internet access to fixed areas on the ground, but trying to stay in one place like this requires a system with major cost and complexity.  So the idea we pursued was based on freeing the balloons and letting them sail freely on the winds.  All we had to do was figure out how to control their path through the sky. We\u2019ve now found a way to do that, using just wind and solar power: we can move the balloons up or down to catch the winds we want them to travel in. That solution then led us to a new problem: how to manage a fleet of balloons sailing around the world so that each balloon is in the area you want it right when you need it. We\u2019re solving this with some complex algorithms and lots of computing power. <br />\n<p>Now we need some help\u2014this experiment is going to take way more than our team alone.  This week we started a pilot program in the <a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Canterbury,+New+Zealand&hl=en&ll=-43.735383,171.702576&spn=1.232403,2.897644&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=43.037246,92.724609&oq=canterbury+n&hnear=Canterbury,+New+Zealand&t=m&z=9\">Canterbury area of New Zealand</a> with 50 testers trying to connect to our balloons.  This is the first time we\u2019ve launched this many balloons (30 this week, in fact) and tried to connect to this many receivers on the ground, and we\u2019re going to learn a lot that will help us improve our technology and balloon design.  <br />\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-11QvZgzOsnc/UbuwCEWYa2I/AAAAAAAAMj0/_HZ1d4IW8jM/s1600/Loon-mission-control.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-11QvZgzOsnc/UbuwCEWYa2I/AAAAAAAAMj0/_HZ1d4IW8jM/s640/Loon-mission-control.png\" /></a></div><p>Over time, we\u2019d like to set up pilots in countries at the same latitude as New Zealand.

Shields, obstacles, and gravity fields change with every new level, and you can unlock power-ups including fireballs, lasers, multi-balls, mirrored controls, bulletproof shields, fog, ghost balls, time bombs, resized paddles, extra lives and death balls\u2013\u2013though you might want to avoid the death balls. If none of your friends are online, you can always play against Bob the Bear and see what level you can reach.

And not just any kiss, but <i>your</i> kiss.<br />\n<br />\nTo get started, simply visit <a href=\"http://kisses.burberry.com/\">kisses.burberry.com</a> and pucker up in front of your webcam (this works best on Chrome). Using unique kiss-detection technology, the site will detect the outline of your actual lips, which you can choose to dress up with a Burberry lipstick color. If you\u2019re using your touch screen mobile or tablet, you can <i>actually</i> kiss your screen (you might want to wipe it off first) and your lip outline will be taken from there. After that, write a short message and send it to someone from your Google+ friends list or via email. Then sit back and see the envelope with your message fly from your city to the receiver\u2019s destination across a 3D landscape. The receiver gets an email, from which they can see the same journey, read your message and hopefully respond with a kiss of their own. <br />\n<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/LRiZMVEIhas\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\n<br />\nFor an example, see <a href=\"http://kisses.burberry.com/kiss/zM67ZgAC\">this message I sent to my mom this morning</a>.

Read the full text below. </i>-Ed.<br />\n<br />\nDear Attorney General Holder and Director Mueller<br />\n<br />\nGoogle has worked tremendously hard over the past fifteen years to earn our users\u2019 trust.  For example, we offer encryption across our services; we have hired some of the best security engineers in the world; and we have consistently pushed back on overly broad government requests for our users\u2019 data.  <br />\n<br />\nWe have always made clear that we comply with valid legal requests.  And last week, the Director of National Intelligence acknowledged that service providers have received Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests.  <br />\n<br />\nAssertions in the press that our compliance with these requests gives the U.S. government unfettered access to our users\u2019 data are simply untrue.  However, government nondisclosure obligations regarding the number of FISA national security requests that Google receives, as well as the number of accounts covered by those requests, fuel that speculation.<br />\n<br />\nWe therefore ask you to help make it possible for Google to publish in our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/US/\">Transparency Report</a> aggregate numbers of national security requests, including FISA disclosures\u2014in terms of both the number we receive and their scope.  Google\u2019s numbers would clearly show that our compliance with these requests falls far short of the claims being made.  Google has nothing to hide. <br />\n<br />\nGoogle appreciates that you authorized the <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/transparency-report-shedding-more-light.html\">recent disclosure</a> of general numbers for national security letters. There have been no adverse consequences arising from their publication, and in fact more companies are receiving your approval to do so as a result of Google\u2019s initiative.  Transparency here will likewise serve the public interest without harming national security.<br />\n<br />\nWe will be making this letter public and await your response. <br />\n<br />\nDavid Drummond <br />\nChief Legal Officer ", "id": "5811003024209978407", "updated": "2013-06-11T11:37:22-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/5811003024209978407/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-06-11T10:32:00-07:00", "title": "Asking the U.S. government to allow Google to publish more national security request data"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/ninety-ideas-to-change-world-announcing.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzc0MTgyOTc5ODI0Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/9091341629052732005", "content": "Many <a href=\"https://www.googlesciencefair.com/en/2013/science-heroes?bookmark=science-heroes-matrix-3\">great scientists</a> developed their curiosity for science at an early age and in January we called on the brightest young minds from around the world to send us <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/google-science-fair-looking-for-next.html\">their ideas to change the world</a>.

An illustrious committee was set up to consider Pekeris\u2019s request and initially opinion was divided.  In particular, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=hGOnMJ2gc-8C&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=einstein+against+weizac&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=82KyUae0KMrJrgHgqoH4CQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=einstein%20against%20weizac&amp;f=false\">Albert Einstein was skeptical</a> a computer in Israel would receive sufficient use and queried whether the skilled resources to build it were available.  It took much convincing by another committee member, mathematician and computing luminary <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann#Computer_science\">John Von Neumann</a>, before the project got the go-ahead.  <br />\n<br />\nConstruction of the WEIZAC (\u201cWeizmann Automatic Calculator\u201d) got underway in late 1953 under the leadership of Professor Pekeris and <a href=\"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/obituary-gerald-estrin-90-ucla-231609.aspx\">Jerry Estrin</a>.  A protege of Von Neumann, Estrin arrived in Israel armed with <a href=\"http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/birth-of-the-computer/4/92\">design drawings based on the computer at the Institute of Advanced Study</a> in Princeton.  After advertising for recruits, a small team of engineers and technicians was assembled, among them Aviezri Fraenkel.  <br />\n<br />\nIt took the team a lot of <a href=\"http://www.jta.org/2004/11/17/life-religion/features/remembering-israels-first-computer\">ingenuity to source the necessary materials</a>.  Some were imported, but others were clever adaptations, such as the thin copper strips that came from a small local bicycle-part shop!  Despite such hurdles, <a href=\"http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki6/index.php/Milestones:WEIZAC_Computer,_1955\">progress was steady</a>, and the major components were in place by the time Estrin returned to the U.S. 15 months later.   <br />\n<br />\nThe WEIZAC <a href=\"http://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/first-computer#.UadSVCt4ZWZ\">performed its first calculation in October 1955</a> and was soon much in demand by Israeli scientists.  It remained operational until the end of 1963\u201450 years ago this year.  Nowadays it resides in the Weizmann Institute\u2019s Ziskind Building as a fitting memorial to where computing in Israel began.  <br />\n<br />\nI have fond memories of passing by the WEIZAC every day when I studied at the Weizmann Institute, where I also had the privilege to attend a class by Professor Fraenkel.

Indeed, the U.S. government does not have direct access or a \u201cback door\u201d to the information stored in our data centers.  We had not heard of a program called PRISM until yesterday.<br />\n<br />\nSecond, we provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law.  Our legal team reviews each and every request, and frequently pushes back when requests are overly broad or don\u2019t follow the correct process.   Press reports that suggest that Google is providing open-ended access to our users\u2019 data are false, period.  Until this week\u2019s reports, we had never heard of the broad type of order that Verizon received\u2014an order that appears to have required them to hand over millions of users\u2019 call records.  We were very surprised to learn that such broad orders exist.  Any suggestion that Google is disclosing information about our users\u2019 Internet activity on such a scale is completely false. <br />\n<br />\nFinally, this episode confirms what we have long believed\u2014there needs to be a more transparent approach.  Google has worked hard, within the confines of the current laws, to be open about the data requests we receive.  We post this information on our <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/US/\">Transparency Report</a> whenever possible.  We were the first company to do this.  And, of course, we understand that the U.S. and other governments need to take action to protect their citizens\u2019 safety\u2014including sometimes by using surveillance.

Regardless of role, level or location, g2g's community-based approach makes it possible for all Googlers to take advantage of a variety of learning opportunities. </i>- Ed.<br />\n<br />\nEight years ago, I loaded five boxes into my pickup truck, said goodbye to a career of crunching numbers in hotel management, and started my own massage practice in Washington state.<br />\n<br />\nSoon thereafter, I started at Google as an <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/jobs/students/lifeatgoogle/benefitsperks/\">onsite massage therapist</a> at the Kirkland and Seattle offices, and I was ready for the challenge. But after a few years of massage work, I started to ponder alternatives to massage to further help my fellow Googlers relax and de-stress. Being able to take a moment out of one\u2019s day to relax and decompress is not only beneficial for one\u2019s health, but also may help people be <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2225634/Is-worlds-happiest-man-Brain-scans-reveal-French-monk-abnormally-large-capacity-joy-meditation.html\">happier</a> and more <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2012/10/if-youre-too-busy-to-meditate.html\">productive</a> in their day to day lives. So in 2011, I helped launch \u201cMindBody Awareness,\u201d a guided meditation class, as part of the Googler-to-Googler (g2g)  program. <br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s no secret that meditation can be an excellent way to relax your body and focus the mind. A plethora of <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2008914,00.html\">studies</a> have supported that point. That said, one of the hardest parts of meditation is simply giving it a try. For an activity based in calmness and openness, it\u2019s ironic how meditation can, for some, engender feelings of intimidation and even embarrassment at the outset. So we specifically designed \u201cMindBody Awareness\u201d for all levels so anyone can walk through the door and dive right in. Having a friendly, informal meditation class taught onsite by a fellow Googler allows for community building, and immediately relaxes participants whether they\u2019re new to the practice or veterans. <br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zqdaoji5tU8/Ua4Yhp6OAXI/AAAAAAAAMgE/c-lyvXO3nxE/s1600/leading+a+class.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zqdaoji5tU8/Ua4Yhp6OAXI/AAAAAAAAMgE/c-lyvXO3nxE/s320/leading+a+class.png\" width=\"240\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>Leading a MindBody Awareness class at our Kirkland, Wash. office </i></div>\n<br />\nWe begin each 30-minute class by going through a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong\">Qigong</a> series that consists of 12 different positions held for 30 seconds each. This is how we begin bringing awareness of one\u2019s body and mind into play, shedding the distractions from the outside and becoming more in tune with one\u2019s self. The second portion of the class is a seated meditation, which incorporates changing hand positions, where chimes go off every minute to signal a change in pose. This integrates the mind and the body instead of just one or the other. The chimes help the mind stay focused, and acts as an anchor helping people return to a quiet mind if they happen to get lost in distraction. An engineer who takes my class told me \u201cbeing aware of what my physical body needs while my brain is busy coding has helped me significantly reduce stress, not get so worn out, and enjoy my job.\u201d Another Googler noted to me that he feels \u201chaving a regular chance to slow down, collect [himself] and connect mind and body contributes to a more mindful, lower stress outlook throughout the week.\u201d <br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JPHsGpMYgKk/Ua4YiOxinfI/AAAAAAAAMgM/DPkER7yczlA/s1600/mindbodyawarenessclass.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"250\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JPHsGpMYgKk/Ua4YiOxinfI/AAAAAAAAMgM/DPkER7yczlA/s320/mindbodyawarenessclass.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>Taking a few minutes a day to sync your mind and body can help you relax and stay focused throughout the work day</i></div>\n<br />\nThrough g2g, we\u2019ve made MindBody Awareness and other meditation classes available in 16 different cities, providing an alternative method of stress relief for Googlers around the world. To make it even easier for Googlers to access meditation classes, we offer global meditative Google Hangouts. Googlers can video conference into a meditation hangout for 30 or 60 minutes to practice meditation as a group.<br />\n<br />\nMeditation class offered through the g2g program has also fostered a unique way to build a sense of community. The class has brought Googlers from varying departments together to meet new people by taking a break for 30 minutes to re-charge.

We\u2019ve committed to buying the entire output of that wind farm for 10 years so that we can power our Finnish data center with renewable energy.  That agreement has helped O2 to secure 100% financing for the construction of the wind farm from the investment arm of German insurance company Allianz, which will assume ownership when the wind farm becomes operational in early 2015.<br />\n<br />\nThis arrangement is possible thanks to Scandinavia\u2019s integrated electricity market and grid system, Nord Pool. It enables us to buy the wind farm\u2019s output in Sweden with Guarantee of Origin certification and consume an equivalent amount of power at our data center in Finland. We then \u201cretire\u201d the Guarantee of Origin certificates to show that we\u2019ve actually used the energy.<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i7OUrs99qqs/Ua0ddhD12dI/AAAAAAAAMfo/dgC6Lmh2AJk/s1600/1.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i7OUrs99qqs/Ua0ddhD12dI/AAAAAAAAMfo/dgC6Lmh2AJk/s550/1.jpg\" width=\"550\" /></a></div><br />\nAs a carbon neutral company, our goal is to use as much renewable energy as possible\u2014and by doing so, stimulate further production.

That\u2019s why, in addition to protecting ourselves against future increases in power prices through long-term purchasing for our operations, we also invest in new renewable energy projects that will deliver a return for our money.

Starting today, we'll also be posting regularly with privacy and security tips. We hope this information helps you understand the choices and control that you have over your online information.</i> -Ed.<br />\n<br />\nIt could be your Gmail, your photos or your documents\u2014whatever you have in your Google Account, we work hard to make sure it\u2019s protected from would-be identity thieves, other bad guys, or any illegitimate attempts to access your information. <br />\n<br />\nBut you can also help keep your information safe. Think of how upset you would be if someone else got access to your Google Account without your permission, and then take five minutes to follow the steps below and help make it more secure. Let\u2019s start with the key to unlocking your account\u2014your password:<br />\n<br />\n<b>1.  Use a different password for each important service</b><br />\nMake sure you have a different password for every important online account you have. Bad guys will steal your username and password from one site, and then use them to try to log into lots of other sites where you might have an account. Even large, reputable sites sometimes have their password databases stolen. If you use the same password across many different sites, there\u2019s a greater chance it might end up on a list of stolen passwords. And the more accounts you have that use that password, the more data you might lose if that password is stolen. <br />\n<br />\nGiving an account its own, strong password helps protect you and your information in that account. Start today by making sure your Google Account has a unique password.<br />\n<br />\n<b>2. Make your password hard to guess </b><br />\n\u201cpassword.\u201d \u201c123456.\u201d \u201cMy name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!\u201d These examples are terrible passwords because everyone knows them\u2014including potential attackers. Making your passwords longer or more complicated makes them harder to guess for both bad guys and people who know you. We know it\u2019s hard: the average password is shorter than 8 characters, and many just contain letters. In a database of 32 million real passwords that were made public in 2009, <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jcb82/doc/B12-IEEESP-analyzing_70M_anonymized_passwords.pdf\">analysis showed</a>&nbsp;(PDF) only 54 percent included numbers, and only 3.7 percent had special characters like &amp; or $.<br />\n<br />\nOne way to build a strong password is to think of a phrase or sentence that other people wouldn\u2019t know and then use that to build your password. For example, for your email you could think of a personal message like \u201cI want to get better at responding to emails quickly and concisely\u201d and then build your password from numbers, symbols, and the first letters of each word\u2014\u201ciw2gb@r2eq&amp;c\u201d. Don\u2019t use popular phrases or lyrics to build your password\u2014<a href=\"http://usablesecurity.com/?p=75\">research suggests</a> that people gravitate to the same phrases, and you want your password to be something only you know.<br />\n<br />\nGoogle doesn\u2019t restrict password length, so go wild! <br />\n<br />\n<b>3. Keep your password somewhere safe</b><br />\n<a href=\"http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2006/proceedings/p44_gaw.pdf\">Research shows</a>&nbsp;(PDF) that worrying about remembering too many passwords is the chief reason people reuse certain passwords across multiple services. But don\u2019t worry\u2014if you\u2019ve created so many passwords that it\u2019s hard to remember them, it\u2019s OK to make a list and write them down. Just make sure you keep your list in a safe place, where you won\u2019t lose it and others won\u2019t be able to find it. If you\u2019d prefer to manage your passwords digitally, a trusted password manager might be a good option. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95606?hl=en\">Chrome</a> and many web browsers have free password managers built into them, and there are many independent options as well\u2014take a few minutes to read through reviews and see what would be best for your needs. <br />\n<b><br />\n4. Set a recovery option</b><br />\nHave you ever forgotten your password? Has one of your friends ever been locked out of their account? <a href=\"http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=183723&amp;ctx=cbo&amp;cbid=423539972&amp;cbrank=2\">Setting a recovery option</a>, like an alternate email address or a telephone number, helps give the service provider another way to contact you if you are ever locked out of your account. Having an up-to-date recovery phone or email address is the best thing you can do to make sure you can get back into your account fast if there is ever a problem.<br />\n<br />\nIf you haven\u2019t set a recovery option for your Google Account, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/183723?hl=en\">add one now</a>. If you have, just take a second to make sure it\u2019s up to date.<br />\n<br />\nWe have more tips on how to pick a good password on our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32040?hl=en\">Help Center</a>, and in the video below:<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/0RCsHJfHL_4\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />\nYour online safety and privacy is important to you, and it\u2019s important to us, too. We\u2019ve made a <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/02/an-update-on-our-war-against-account.html\">huge amount of progress</a> to help protect your Google Account from people who want to break into it, but for the time being, creating a unique, strong password is still an important way to protect your online accounts. Please take five minutes today to reset your important passwords using the tips above, and stay tuned for more security tips throughout the summer.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Diana Smetters, Software Engineer</span>", "id": "6789578941045183226", "updated": "2013-06-26T17:15:31-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["privacy and security", "security", "security and safety tips"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/6789578941045183226/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-05-30T10:00:00-07:00", "title": "Helping passwords better protect you "}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/investing-in-south-african-solar-project.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzY5OTMwMjMwNzAzCm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/6650156310272650133", "content": "As we search for investments that can help speed up the adoption of renewable energy, we\u2019ve been looking beyond the U.S. and Europe to parts of the world where our investments can have an even greater impact.

First, we only pursue investments that we believe make financial sense. South Africa\u2019s strong resources and supportive policies for renewable energy make it an attractive place to invest\u2014which is why it had the highest growth in clean energy investment in the world last year. Second, we look for projects that have transformative potential\u2014that is, projects that will bolster the growth of the renewable energy industry and move the world closer to a clean energy future. The Jasper Power Project is one of those transformative opportunities. To explain why, perhaps some background would be helpful.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<br /></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\nBack in 2008, South Africa experienced a severe energy shortage, which resulted in blackouts throughout the country and slowed down economic growth. Since then the South African government has been actively supporting the growth of new sources of electricity to power the nation. While today South Africa is primarily dependent on fossil fuels, there\u2019s lots of potential for renewable energy\u2014it\u2019s a country blessed with abundant wind and solar resources\u2014and the government has set an ambitious goal of generating 18 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy by 2030 (as a comparison, the entire South African grid is currently <a href=\"http://www.reegle.info/countries/south-africa-energy-profile/ZA\">44 GW</a>).</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<br /></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\nTo meet this goal, the South African government has established the <a href=\"http://www.ipprenewables.co.za/\">Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program</a> (REIPPPP).  Through the program, renewable energy projects compete on the basis of cost and contribution to the local economy to be awarded a contract with Eskom, South Africa\u2019s state-owned energy utility. Jasper and the other projects being developed through the REIPPPP have the potential to transform the South African energy grid.  And given South Africa\u2019s position as an economic powerhouse in Africa, a greener grid in South Africa can set an example for the whole continent.</div>\n</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PXF8IuuaUuk/Uad3LB6lWKI/AAAAAAAAMb8/ggWyLFaJHYA/s1600/solarpanelsjasper.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"356\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PXF8IuuaUuk/Uad3LB6lWKI/AAAAAAAAMb8/ggWyLFaJHYA/s640/solarpanelsjasper.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>Once constructed, the project will use solar panels like these. </i></div>\n<br />\nJust as compelling are the economic and social benefits that the project will bring to the local community. Jasper will create approximately 300 construction and 50 permanent jobs in a region experiencing high rates of <a href=\"http://www.statssa.gov.za/keyindicators/keyindicators.asp\">unemployment</a>, as well as providing rural development and education programs and setting aside a portion of total project revenues\u2014amounting to approximately $26 million over the life of the project\u2014for enterprise and socio-economic development. We appreciate how forward-thinking the South African government has been in designing the REIPPPP to encourage these kinds of local economic benefits.<br />\n<br />\nGoogle has committed more than $1 billion to renewable energy investments and we continue to search for new opportunities.  Our search has brought us from the U.S. to Europe and now to Africa. We\u2019re excited to see where else it might lead.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Rick Needham, Director, Energy &amp; Sustainability</span>", "id": "6650156310272650133", "updated": "2013-05-30T09:10:30-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["energy", "green"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/6650156310272650133/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-05-30T09:04:00-07:00", "title": "Investing in a South African solar project"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-new-inbox-that-puts-you-back-in.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzY5ODQ2NDQ5MTgwCm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/1464820145674181061", "content": "We get a lot of different types of email: messages from friends, social notifications, deals and offers, confirmations and receipts, and more.

This imagery will be used by Catlin Seaview Survey to create a visual and scientific baseline record of the marine environment surrounding the islands, allowing for any future changes to be measured and evaluated by scientists around the world. <br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WSC_FjtKmdA/UZ2W0k9RbKI/AAAAAAAAMbY/pS0SZ2UlkXg/s1600/1+SVII+with+Sealions1%C2%A9+Catlin+Seaview+Survey.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"422\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WSC_FjtKmdA/UZ2W0k9RbKI/AAAAAAAAMbY/pS0SZ2UlkXg/s640/1+SVII+with+Sealions1%C2%A9+Catlin+Seaview+Survey.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<i><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">Christophe Bailhache navigates the SVII camera through a large group of Sea Lions at Champion Island in Galapagos.

To check them out, go to Google Trends and click \"Top Charts\" on the left-hand side.

Over the next three days, we\u2019ll be hosting technical sessions, hands-on code labs, and demonstrations of Google's products and partners' technology.<br />\n<br />\nWe believe computing is going through one of the most exciting moments in its history: people are increasingly adopting phones, tablets and newer type of devices. And this spread of technology has the potential to make a positive impact in the lives of people around the world\u2014whether it's simply helping you in your daily commute, or connecting you to information that was previously inaccessible.<br />\n<br />\nThis is why we focus so much on our two open platforms: Android and Chrome. They enable developers to innovate and reach as many people as possible with their apps and services across multiple devices. Android started as a simple idea to advance open standards on mobile; today it is the world\u2019s leading mobile platform and growing rapidly. Similarly, Chrome launched less than five years ago from an open source project; today it\u2019s the world\u2019s most popular browser. <br />\n<br />\nIn line with that vision, we made several announcements today designed to give developers even more tools to build great apps on Android and Chrome. We also shared new innovations from across Google meant to help make life just a little easier for you, including improvements in search, communications, photos, and maps. <br />\n<br />\nHere\u2019s a quick look at some of the announcements we made at I/O:<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n<li><b><a href=\"http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2013/05/androidio-just-press-play.html\">Android &amp; Google Play</a>:</b> In addition to new developer tools, we unveiled Google Play Music All Access, a monthly music subscription service with access to millions of songs that joins our music store and locker; and the Google Play game services with real-time multiplayer and leaderboards. Also, coming next month to Google Play is a special Samsung Galaxy S4, which brings together cutting edge hardware from Samsung with Google\u2019s latest software and services\u2014including the user experience that ships with our popular Nexus devices.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+chrome\">Chrome</a>:</b> With over 750 million active users on Chrome, we\u2019re now focused on bringing to mobile the speed, simplicity and security improvements that we\u2019ve seen on the desktop. To that end, today we previewed next-generation video codec <a href=\"http://blog.webmproject.org/2013/05/vp9-codec-nears-completion.html\">VP9</a> for faster video-streaming performance; the <a href=\"http://www.chromium.org/developers/using-requestautocomplete\">requestAutocomplete API</a> for faster payments; and Chrome Experiments such as \"<a href=\"http://www.thehobbit.com/middle-earth\">A Journey Through Middle Earth</a>\" and <a href=\"http://g.co/racer\">Racer</a> to demonstrate the ability to create immersive mobile experiences not possible in years past.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"http://googleplusproject.blogspot.com/2013/05/new-google-stream-hangouts-and-photos.html\">Google+</a>: </b>We unveiled the newly designed Google+, which helps you easily explore content as well dramatically improve your online photo experience to give you crisp, beautiful photos\u2014without the work! We also upgraded Google+ Hangouts\u2014our popular group video application\u2014to help bring all of your real-life conversations online, across any device or platform, and with groups of up to 10 friends.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-multi-screen-and-conversational.html\">Search</a>:</b> Search has evolved considerably in recent years: it can now have a real conversation with you, and even make your day a bit smoother by predicting information you might need. Today we added the ability to set reminders by voice and we previewed \u201cspoken answers\u201d on laptops and desktops in Chrome\u2014meaning you can ask Google a question and it will speak the answer back to you.</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2013/05/meet-new-google-maps-map-for-every.html\">Maps</a>:</b> Today we previewed the next generation of Google Maps, which gets rid of any clutter in order to put your individual experience and exploration front and center. Each time you click or search, our technology draws you a tailored map that highlights the information you need. From design to directions, the new Google Maps is smarter and more useful.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nTechnology can have a profound, positive impact on the daily lives of billions of people. But we can\u2019t do this alone\u2014developers play a crucial role.

Working with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), NASA and TIME, we're releasing more than a quarter-century of images of Earth taken from space, compiled for the first time into an interactive time-lapse experience. We believe this is the most comprehensive picture of our changing planet ever made available to the public. <br />\n<br />\nBuilt from millions of satellite images and trillions of pixels, you can explore this global, zoomable time-lapse map as part of TIME's new <a href=\"http://www.time.com/timelapse\">Timelapse</a> project.

Their satellites have been observing earth from space since the 1970s\u2014with all of the images sent back to Earth and archived on USGS tape drives that look something like this <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lEjeqRDEFmU/UYsrpLYPmYI/AAAAAAAAMRs/NOH7ZofjBNY/s1600/USGS+imagery+tape+vault+in+Sioux+Falls+South+Dakota+-+3c.jpg\">example</a>&nbsp;(courtesy of the USGS).<br />\n<br />\nWe started working with the USGS in 2009 to make this historic archive of earth imagery available online. Using <a href=\"http://earthengine.google.org/\">Google Earth Engine</a> technology, we sifted through 2,068,467 images\u2014a total of 909 terabytes of data\u2014to find the highest-quality pixels (e.g., those without clouds), for every year since 1984 and for every spot on Earth. We then compiled these into enormous planetary images, 1.78 terapixels each, one for each year. <br />\n<br />\nAs the final step, we worked with the CREATE Lab at Carnegie Mellon University, recipients of a <a href=\"http://research.google.com/university/relations/focused_research_awards.html\">Google Focused Research Award</a>, to convert these annual Earth images into a seamless, browsable HTML5 animation. Check it out on Google\u2019s <a href=\"http://earthengine.google.org/timelapse\">Timelapse</a> website.<br />\n<br />\nMuch like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble\">iconic image of Earth from the Apollo 17 mission</a>\u2014which had a profound effect on many of us\u2014this time-lapse map is not only fascinating to explore, but we also hope it can inform the global community\u2019s thinking about how we live on our planet and the policies that will guide us in the future.

But dancing isn\u2019t just limited to holidays. Since 2003, <a href=\"http://www.wherethehellismatt.com/about\">Matt Harding</a> has famously been dancing his way across the globe with people from all walks of life and sharing to millions on his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/mattharding2718?feature=watch\">YouTube channel</a>. His mission is simple: Dance. Dance with everyone. Dance everywhere. Dance to spread joy.<br />\n<br />\nMatt\u2019s journey began with a serendipitous, <a href=\"http://www.wherethehellismatt.com/maps/2003-travel\">single dance step</a> in Hanoi. While traveling through Southeast Asia, his friend encouraged him to dance for the camera\u2014and he just kept dancing. At first, he was amused by the idea of capturing himself dancing in front of famous landmarks and in famous cities around the world. Since then, Matt\u2019s videos have evolved beyond a single man dancing; his videos now focus on individuals that gather together to share in the fun of dance, as you can see in his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwe-pA6TaZk\">2012 YouTube film</a>.<br />\n<br />\nThe joy that goes into Matt\u2019s work is apparent\u2014and well documented. However, there\u2019s also a fair amount of planning involved to choreograph his efforts. Matt relies on <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/helloworld\">Google Maps</a> for comprehensive, accurate and useful tools to execute and track his steps. <br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/VI52ZgaPe_E?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\n</div><br />\nBefore he sets off on each adventure, Matt uses Google Maps to scout various locations. Using <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/streetview\">Street View</a> and photos in Google Maps, he finds landmarks and points of interest around the globe that are prefect dance spots. For instance, he came across Piazza del Popolo while exploring Rome with Street View. These tools come in handy to help Matt choose a backdrop to highlight his assembly of exuberant, local dancers. <br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"350\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?daddr=Piazza+del+Popolo,+00187+Rome,+Italy&amp;gl=us&amp;panel=1&amp;fb=1&amp;dirflg=d&amp;geocode=0,41.910685,12.476305&amp;cid=0,0,652705663488327139&amp;hq=Piazza+del+Popolo&amp;t=m&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=41.910384,12.476908&amp;panoid=dysttSfjPEK03Y43TDQAiA&amp;cbp=12,312.82,,1,-10&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=41.909719,12.477593&amp;spn=0.010843,0.022724&amp;source=embed&amp;output=svembed\" width=\"425\"></iframe><br />\n</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><small><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><i>Piazza del Popolo in Rome -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?daddr=Piazza+del+Popolo,+00187+Rome,+Italy&amp;gl=us&amp;panel=1&amp;fb=1&amp;dirflg=d&amp;geocode=0,41.910685,12.476305&amp;cid=0,0,652705663488327139&amp;hq=Piazza+del+Popolo&amp;t=m&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=41.910384,12.476908&amp;panoid=dysttSfjPEK03Y43TDQAiA&amp;cbp=12,312.82,,1,-10&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=41.909719,12.477593&amp;spn=0.010843,0.022724&amp;source=embed\" style=\"color: blue; text-align: left;\">View Larger Map</a></i></span></small></div><br />\nScouting is only part of the process.

At a time when too many governments deny their citizens the right to dissent, we\u2019ll ask if the Internet is reaching its promise of empowering people around the world.

Today, for the seventh time, we\u2019re releasing new numbers showing <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/\">requests from governments to remove content</a> from our services. From July to December 2012, we received 2,285 government requests to remove 24,179 pieces of content\u2014an increase from the 1,811 requests to remove 18,070 pieces of content that we received during the first half of 2012.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1SQIQxtu4OQ/UXlHVlGHNsI/AAAAAAAAMJ4/zwyDcGBE1RQ/s1600/13D7z7UpZ_1RSX1tDHDo_tyuxUwVmhzHYjarTjw.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"317\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1SQIQxtu4OQ/UXlHVlGHNsI/AAAAAAAAMJ4/zwyDcGBE1RQ/s400/13D7z7UpZ_1RSX1tDHDo_tyuxUwVmhzHYjarTjw.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />\nAs we\u2019ve gathered and released more data over time, it\u2019s become increasingly clear that the scope of government attempts to censor content on Google services has grown. In more places than ever, we\u2019ve been asked by governments to remove political content that people post on our services. In this particular time period, we received court orders in several countries to remove blog posts criticizing government officials or their associates. <br />\n<br />\nYou can read more about these requests by looking at the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/notes/?by=period\">annotations</a> section of the Transparency Report. Of particular note were three occurrences that took place in the second half of 2012:<br />\n<br />\n<ul><li>There was a sharp increase in requests from <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/BR/\">Brazil</a>, where we received 697 requests to remove content from our platforms (of which 640 were court orders\u2014meaning we received an average of 3.5 court orders per day during this time period), up from 191 during the first half of the year. The big reason for the spike was the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_municipal_elections,_2012\">municipal elections</a>, which took place last fall. Nearly half of the total requests\u2014316 to be exact\u2014called for the removal of 756 pieces of content related to alleged violations of the <a href=\"http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/l4737.htm\">Brazilian Electoral Code</a>, which forbids defamation and commentary that offends candidates. We\u2019re appealing many of these cases, on the basis that the content is protected by freedom of expression under the Brazilian Constitution.<br />\n</li>\n<li>Another place where we saw an increase was from <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/RU/\">Russia</a>, where a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20096274\">new law took effect</a> last fall. In the first half of 2012, we received six requests, the most we had ever received in any given six-month period from Russia. But in the second half of the year, we received 114 requests to remove content\u2014107 of them citing this new law.<br />\n</li>\n<li>During this period, we received inquiries from 20 countries regarding YouTube videos containing clips of the movie \u201cInnocence of Muslims.\u201d While the videos were within our <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines\">Community Guidelines</a>, we restricted videos from view in several countries in accordance with local law after receiving formal legal complaints. We also temporarily restricted videos from view in Egypt and Libya due to the particularly difficult circumstances there.</li>\n</ul><br />\nWe\u2019ve also made a couple of improvements to the Transparency Report since our last update:<br />\n<br />\n<ul><li>We\u2019re now breaking down government requests about YouTube videos to clarify whether we removed videos in response to government requests for violating Community Guidelines, or whether we restricted videos from view due to local laws.

We look forward to continuing to support the development of the STEM Teacher Corps and doing our part to ensure that every student has access to truly great STEM teachers.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Jordan Lloyd Bookey, Head of K-12 Education Outreach and Nancy Lee, Director of People Operations</span>", "id": "5363797742662391913", "updated": "2013-04-22T11:46:47-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["education and research"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/5363797742662391913/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-04-22T11:00:00-07:00", "title": "In support of a national STEM Teacher Corps"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/following-lead-of-natures-engineers.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzY2NjM4OTk4NzA5Cm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/5546094047582066100", "content": "It\u2019s no surprise that Google appreciates engineers.

The most straightforward way to do this is for utilities to offer a renewable power option for companies that request it\u2014something that\u2019s not currently offered by most utilities. We\u2019ve just published a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/green/pdf/renewable-energy-options.pdf\">white paper</a>&nbsp;(PDF) laying out our thoughts on how and why such programs might work.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re also announcing our first effort to put this idea into practice.

Because the service is made available to a wide range of customers, companies that don\u2019t have the ability or resources to pursue alternative approaches can participate. And by tapping utilities\u2019 strengths in power generation and delivery, it makes it easier for companies to buy renewable energy on a larger scale. Of course, the approach is not without its challenges: utilities will need to work out the mechanics of the service within their local regulatory structure, and in many cases state utility commissions will need to approve the programs. There\u2019s also the challenge of finding cost-effective renewable projects. <br />\n<br />\nWe'll continue to find creative ways to supply our facilities with renewable energy, but we think this solution can provide an important new way to increase the use of renewable energy nationwide.

And it lets them sit next to and work with established entrepreneurs and peers who\u2019ve experienced the exact same challenges they face.  <br />\n<br />\nActive in a number of cities now, Startup Weekend NEXT will expand globally over the course of 2013.  Using Google+ Hangouts, NEXT experts will train local instructors from Reykjavik to Ramallah, enabling entrepreneurs all over the world to launch and build their businesses.  <br />\n<br />\nWe were excited to officially launch this partnership at <a href=\"http://www.campuslondon.com/\">Campus London</a>, with Steve Blank joining us live over Google+ Hangout to kick things off.  Campus opened a year ago this month and now has 10,000 members, is home to more than 100 young businesses and has hosted more than 800 entrepreneurship events.  <br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve been energized by the incredible momentum and connections that are happening within Campus\u2019 walls and through our partners\u2019 programs\u2014including Startup Weekend\u2019s, which runs its European operations from Campus London. Together, we look forward to equipping entrepreneurs with the skills they need to start and scale great companies. <br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by John Lyman, Google for Entrepreneurs</span>", "id": "4513776146410632065", "updated": "2013-04-18T17:00:14-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["entrepreneurship"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/4513776146410632065/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-04-17T09:00:00-07:00", "title": "Helping entrepreneurs take the \u201cNEXT\u201d step"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/secretary-of-state-john-kerry-kicks-off.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzgwMDQ4NzI1ODcwCm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/4596134626434151949", "content": "Over the past year, Google+ has been used across the globe to connect people and enable free expression\u2014from <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107256283824559335723/posts\">Syria Deeply</a>, an independent news site which regularly uses Google+ and Hangouts to report about the crisis in Syria to <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/102473617999979724437/posts\">Tom Fletcher</a>, the British Ambassador to Lebanon, who issues dispatches from one country to another via Hangout.<br />\n<br />\nToday, the U.S. Department of State is building on this trend by announcing a new series of discussions called \u201cHangouts at State.\u201d Each month, these conversations will bring people together across global boundaries to discuss the most pressing U.S. foreign policy issues, like democracy promotion, human rights, counterterrorism efforts, economic development, climate change and drug interdiction.   <br />\n<br />\nThe series kicks off on Friday, April 19 with a <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+StateDept/posts\">Hangout</a> with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, entitled \u201cThe U.S. in the World: What\u2019s In It for Us\u201d and moderated by NBC\u2019s Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell.

In honour of this and all our partners, large and small, traditional and modern, let\u2019s take a quick look at how people are interacting with art online.  <br />\n<br />\nThe Internet brings paintings to life and it seems that <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/moma-the-museum-of-modern-art/artwork/the-starry-night-vincent-van-gogh/320268/\">The Starry Night</a> by van Gogh is the one that visitors to Art Project admire the most. In the past six months, this was the most viewed painting in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/artworks/?filter.primary_asset_is_gigapixel=True\">gigapixel</a>\u2014an extremely high resolution painting which allows viewers to zoom in to brushstroke level. While nothing beats seeing a painting in real life, the ability to examine a work of art in this level of detail seems to be encouraging viewers to linger. One minute is the average time spent looking at any given painting on the Art Project website, compared to under 20 seconds (according to several studies) in a museum. <br />\n<br />\nThe Starry Night is also the most frequently included painting in <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/galleries/\">user galleries</a>, where individuals create and share their own virtual art collections. We have 40,000 works of art on the platform but some remain perennial favourites. The other most popular inclusions in user galleries (in order) are :<br />\n<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Botticelli: <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/uffizi-gallery/artwork/the-birth-of-venus-botticelli-sandro-botticelli/331474/\">The Birth of Venus</a></li>\n<li>Rembrandt: <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/the-art-institute-of-chicago/artwork/self-portrait-drawing-at-a-window-rembrandt-harmenszoon-van-rijn/450235/\">Self Portrait Drawing at a Window</a></li>\n<li>van Gogh: <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/van-gogh-museum/artwork/the-bedroom-vincent-van-gogh/330267/\">The Bedroom</a></li>\n<li>Manet: <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/alte-nationalgalerie-staatliche-museen-zu-berlin/artwork/in-the-conservatory-edouard-manet/326376/\">In the Conservatory</a></li>\n<li>Bruegel (the Elder): <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art/artwork/the-harvesters-pieter-bruegel-the-elder-netherlandish-breda-ca-15251569-brussels/653014/\">The Harvesters</a></li>\n<li>van Gogh: <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/van-gogh-museum/artwork/sunflowers-vincent-van-gogh/326270/\">Sunflowers</a></li>\n<li>Holbein (the Younger): <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/the-national-gallery-london/artwork/the-ambassadors-hans-holbein-the-younger/328434/\">The Ambassadors</a></li>\n<li>van Gogh: <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/van-gogh-museum/artwork/field-with-flowers-near-arles-vincent-van-gogh/326271/\">Field with Flowers near Arles</a></li>\n<li>B\u00f6cklin: <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/alte-nationalgalerie-staatliche-museen-zu-berlin/artwork/the-isle-of-the-dead-arnold-bocklin/320391/\">The Isle of the Dead</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xfsqLLNSC1o/UWg9hljYD9I/AAAAAAAAMFg/sudUXrDpfHQ/s1600/Van+Gogh+-+The+Starry+Night.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"218\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xfsqLLNSC1o/UWg9hljYD9I/AAAAAAAAMFg/sudUXrDpfHQ/s400/Van+Gogh+-+The+Starry+Night.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>The Starry Night on Art Project</i></div>\n<br />\nViewings of user galleries were in fact higher than any individual artist or painting. To date, 360,000 galleries have been created, 14,000 of which are public on the web. To mark World Art Day, we asked some of our <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/collections/\">partners</a> to curate user galleries of their own. Take a look through the selections of eight museum directors <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/galleries/\">here</a>.<br />\n<br />\nGiven the list above, it\u2019s clear the classics remain popular with viewers, but there is increasing interest in modern art as well, with <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/artist/salvador-dal%C3%AD/4132134/\">Dali</a> and <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/artist/gustav-klimt/4127340/\">Klimt</a> featuring among the most searched for artists. The Internet has also allowed users to explore multiple genres in a single destination. More than 30 different mediums co-exist on Art Project with oil on canvas next to over 5,000 objects including <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/collection/the-museum-of-islamic-art-qatar/artwork/silk-velvet-textile-unknown-iran-17th-century/808548/\">silk textiles</a>, <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/galleries/24058347/24046349/\">sculptures</a> and <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/galleries/24156475/24196192/\">furniture</a>. There can't be many places where you can find <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/collection/sao-paulo-street-art/\">Brazilian street art</a> alongside <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/artist/sandro-botticelli/4128053/\">Botticelli</a>.<br />\n<br />\nMany partners who have contributed an art collection have also opted to put their museums on Street View. On average, visitors spend around two minutes exploring the interior of the buildings and viewing the paintings on display. The most-visited Street View destination on Art Project is <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/collection/the-white-house/museumview/\">The White House</a>. As the majority of us will never get the opportunity to go inside, the Internet allows a rare glimpse into a global institution that also houses an extensive art <a href=\"http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/collection/the-white-house/\">collection</a>.<br />\n<br />\nWith over 200 partners from 43 countries, we continue our quest to open up access to art to millions of professionals, students, beginners and amateur enthusiasts.

By connecting technologists and experts with those who understand and have lived through trafficking situations, our discussion centered around a fundamental question: What if local, national, and regional anti-trafficking helplines across the globe were all connected in a data-driven network that helped disrupt the web of human trafficking?<br />\n<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/kdQrLMEF-Eg\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\n<br />\nSince the summit, we\u2019ve worked with Polaris Project, Liberty Asia and La Strada International to make this concept a reality. These organizations exist to provide vital help to victims in need across the United States, the Mekong Delta region and Europe. Now, working across borders, this new Global Human Trafficking Hotline Network will collect data from local hotline efforts, share promising practices and create anti-trafficking strategies that build on common patterns and focus on eradication, prevention and victim protection. To enhance the participating organizations' ability to better share, analyze and act upon their data in real time, <a href=\"http://www.palantir.com/2013/04/collaborating-with-googles-global-impact-award-winners-to-fight-human-trafficking/\">Palantir Technologies</a> will expand on its existing relationship with Polaris Project by donating its data integration and analytics platform for this project. In addition, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.salesforce.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAMJGO7L2drck6VpHN4y3uYNmnLQ\">Salesforce.com</a> supports Polaris Project's hotline center and is helping scale their call tracking infrastructure internationally.<br />\n<br />\nTogether, these partners will not only be able to help more trafficking survivors, but will also move the global conversation forward by dramatically increasing the amount of useful data being shared. Appropriate data can tell the anti-trafficking community which campaigns are most effective at reducing slavery, what sectors are undergoing global spikes in slavery, or if the reduction of slavery in one country coincides with an increase right across the border.<br />\n<br />\nIn the U.S., Polaris Project has collected data from over 72,000 hotline calls, helping local and national anti-trafficking communities better understand the dynamics of the crime. No such actionable hotline database has existed globally \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t need to be that way. Clear international strategies, increased cooperation, and appropriate data sharing amongst anti-trafficking organizations will help victims, prevention efforts, and sound policymaking. Slavery can be stopped. Let's get to it.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Jared Cohen, Director of Google Ideas and Jacquelline Fuller, Director of Google Giving</span>", "id": "629287318376674273", "updated": "2013-04-18T17:00:16-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/629287318376674273/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-04-09T11:36:00-07:00", "title": "Fighting human trafficking"}, {"author": {"id": "g112374322230920073195", "displayName": "Google Blogs", "url": "https://www.blogger.com/profile/08434147677241700960", "image": {"url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SMZmHeOVbFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAR7c/esUAZEvmr9M/s35-c/photo.jpg"}}, "url": "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/google-fibers-next-stop-austin-texas.html", "blog": {"id": "10861780"}, "etag": "\"GtyIIQmNmmUjEA0nwhSqMElCJ1g/dGltZXN0YW1wOiAxMzY2MzI5NjE3MTAyCm9mZnNldDogLTI1MjAwMDAwCg\"", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/8026140658478549318", "content": "We know that your time is valuable and so we\u2019ve always focused on speed \u2014 from search to Gmail, Chrome to Android. Two years ago, we announced that we\u2019d be bringing Google Fiber to Kansas City to show what\u2019s possible with super fast Internet access, and since November we\u2019ve been connecting homes there to gigabit Internet that\u2019s 100 times faster than today\u2019s average broadband performance.<br />\n<br />\nToday, we\u2019re pleased to announce with Mayor Lee Leffingwell that Austin, Texas is becoming a Google Fiber city. It\u2019s a mecca for creativity and entrepreneurialism, with thriving artistic and tech communities, as well as the University of Texas and its new medical research hospital. We\u2019re sure these folks will do amazing things with gigabit access, and we feel very privileged to have been welcomed to their community.<br />\n<br />\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lALafkdBLTA\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />\n<br />\nOur goal is to start connecting homes in Austin by mid-2014. Customers there will have a similar <a href=\"https://fiber.google.com/about/\">choice of products</a> as our customers in Kansas City: Gigabit Internet or Gigabit Internet plus our Google Fiber TV service with nearly 200 HD TV channels. We\u2019re still working out pricing details, but we expect them to be roughly similar to Kansas City. Also, as in Kansas City, we\u2019re going to offer customers a free Internet connection at 5 mbps for 7 years, provided they pay a one-time construction fee. We\u2019re also planning to connect many public institutions as we build in Austin\u2014 schools, hospitals, community centers, etc. \u2014 at a gigabit for no charge. If you live in Austin and want to sign up for more information, please visit our website.<br />\n<br />\nThe Internet is still in its early days and has so much more potential to improve our lives. The web helps students and families access essential resources, from information about jobs and healthcare to banking and educational services. Communities that are connected to the Internet grow stronger because there\u2019s greater potential to create jobs, drive economic growth, and help businesses succeed. We believe the Internet\u2019s next chapter will be built on gigabit speeds, and we hope this new Google Fiber city will inspire communities across America to think about what ultrafast connectivity could mean for them.

We\u2019re often asked to present in front of a group, so good presentation skills are really important. Fear of public speaking is often <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2012/10/09/five-reasons-why-the-fear-of-public-speaking-is-great-for-you/\">ranked</a> higher than fear of spiders, flying and heights. While spiders can make me jumpy, I not only <i>enjoy</i> public speaking, I also teach it. <br />\n<br />\nIn addition to my core role as Google Toronto\u2019s agency team lead (helping to nurture relationships with some of the largest ad agencies in Canada), I help my colleagues amp up their public speaking skills as a g2g (Googler-to-Googler) facilitator for two classes, \u201cPresenting with Confidence\u201d and \u201cPresenting with Charisma.\u201d These two classes help my fellow Googlers erase anxiety and self-doubt and focus on the goal\u2014communicating your message. I am actually a mechanical engineer by trade who, at one point, entered graduate school to study robotics. Not exactly the type that comes to mind when you think of great orators. But I\u2019ve learned along the way, as an engineer turned \u201csales guy,\u201d that a confident demeanor and a little charm can turn a snooze-fest into an engaging, lively meeting.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rlet9s8aK38/UVxmqKkBFRI/AAAAAAAAMEY/n8TAEY5Atng/s1600/1N7B9kg6xFrFArdzXq_W-LrPDrtS_2xK2WeVE.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rlet9s8aK38/UVxmqKkBFRI/AAAAAAAAMEY/n8TAEY5Atng/s400/1N7B9kg6xFrFArdzXq_W-LrPDrtS_2xK2WeVE.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>Here I am teaching one of our Presenting with Confidence classes in our New York City office.&nbsp;</i></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>Photo by Jane Hu.</i></div>\n<br />\n\u201cPresenting with Confidence\u201d goes beyond the \u201cpicture the audience in their underwear\u201d adage. First, students are tasked with making brief presentations about themselves, whether it be about their most recent vacation or how they play in a jazz band. We videotape the students giving their presentations on their phones to review later as a part of the exercise and to keep for their own reference. This, as it turns out, is one of the most effective, eye-opening exercises in the class. Before we roll the tape, the participant comments on an area he/she believes will be pointed out by others, such as, \u201cI always fidget with my hands\u201d or, \u201cI blush as red as a tomato.\u201d The reality is often completely different, and provides an immediate boost of confidence, allowing the student to focus on the content of their presentation. Part of the confidence boost also stems from being surrounded by peers who are in the same boat, so there\u2019s no judgment. <br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4QWkxPNa6zo/UVxmzm42J2I/AAAAAAAAMEg/rWAqy7_E2q8/s1600/1Y-oDDSIboq_YuwvsCjVwoED7po9AScSolXqyRw.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4QWkxPNa6zo/UVxmzm42J2I/AAAAAAAAMEg/rWAqy7_E2q8/s400/1Y-oDDSIboq_YuwvsCjVwoED7po9AScSolXqyRw.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>Sharing honest feedback with your peers is an important part of the learning process.&nbsp;</i></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<i>Photo by Jane Hu.</i></div>\n<br />\n\u201cPresenting with Charisma\u201d focuses on adding charm and magnetism to your speech. The more the audience wants to hear from a speaker, the more information they\u2019ll absorb. In this class, Googlers nail down the right mix of tone, body language and delivery to better captivate their audience. We role play to learn how to conquer inevitable yet potentially disastrous moments, like when your technology demo crashes. <br />\n<br />\nI experienced one such moment myself when I covered a presentation for a fellow Googler at the last minute. When I started getting asked questions that were beyond my ability to handle, I followed the advice I give my own students, which is to remain calm, upbeat and easy-going\u2014no matter what. I decided to play off the audience\u2019s own knowledge so that the Q&amp;A became more of a dialogue rather than the spotlight shining solely on me.<br />\n<br />\nSolid communication skills anchor any job function. Whether you are an engineer presenting new findings to your manager or a salesperson pitching a new business strategy to a client, a few tips and a lot of practice can make a significant impact on your presentations. If you\u2019re one of the many, <i>many</i> professionals who feels uneasy about getting up in front of a room full of people, try the following tried-and-true techniques to start mastering the art of public speaking.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Tips and tricks to boost your public speaking confidence and charisma:</b><br />\n<br />\n<b>1) Pace yourself.</b> To slow down and build momentum, try reciting a sentence then walking to the other side of the room. Pause, then walk back to the other side and deliver your next sentence. <br />\n<br />\n<b>2) Unfreeze.</b> What to do if you totally freeze during your presentation? Look at your slide or notes and just describe what you see on the slide or page in front of you. The words will start flowing and come back to you.<br />\n<br />\n<b>3) Fidget and fiddle no more.</b> Displacement tactic: if you find yourself always fiddling with your hands or keeping your hands in your pockets, try standing behind a chair or a podium and planting your hands on the podium so you appear confident. (Even <a href=\"http://app1.kuhf.org/_images/jfk_moon/JFK_podium-tn.jpg\">political leaders</a> use this trick.)<br />\n<br />\n<b>4) Get physical.</b> Use the room to your advantage and keep your audience alert. Walk across the room or even among the audience to get people involved in your presentation. <br />\n<br />\n<b>5) Stop saying \u201cUm.\u201d</b> To rid yourself of \u201cumm\u201d-ing your way through a presentation, use this physical displacement tactic: Every time you are transitioning from one point to another, do something small but physical, like moving your pen. Making a conscious effort to move the pen will turn your brain off from using a verbal filler instead.<br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Adam Green, Agency Lead and G2G Instructor</span>", "id": "4066166962784307352", "updated": "2013-06-04T09:44:35-07:00", "kind": "blogger#post", "labels": ["g2g", "googlers and culture"], "replies": {"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/10861780/posts/4066166962784307352/comments", "totalItems": "0"}, "published": "2013-04-04T09:31:00-07:00", "title": "Become a public speaking pro: learning how to present the next great idea"}], "kind": "blogger#postList"}
