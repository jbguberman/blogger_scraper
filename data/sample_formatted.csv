<br />
It’s been said solitaire’s roots are in fortune telling. If that’s true, today your fate rests on your quick wit and the luck of the draw. When you search for “<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=solitaire&amp;oq=solitaire&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61l3j69i59j0.251j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"">solitaire</a>” on Google, the familiar patience game may test yours!<br />

In this game of naughts and crosses, you can select your level of difficulty or even go head to head against a friend. Xs and Os to the winner (hugs and kisses, that is!).<br />

<br />
These are just a sample of the delightful surprises that await you on Google. After all, Search is for so much more than research and practical matters -- it’s for fun, too!<br />

The molten rock around the (very) active Kīlauea Volcano appears to swirl and move — and sometimes it really does! At Bryce Canyon, one of the darkest places in North America, you can see the massive Milky Way glittering across the night sky. <br />
<br />
The U.S. National Parks are full of wonders, but most people don’t get the chance to visit in person. While nothing beats the real thing, for this month’s 100th anniversary of the National Parks Service, we wanted to see if we could use Google’s technology to help share the parks with everyone.<br />
Starting today anyone can take a virtual tour of some of our most breathtaking National Parks, no matter where you are, with Google’s <a href=""https://artsandculture.withgoogle.com/nationalparks?utm_source=ogb-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-pr&amp;utm_campaign=National-parks"">The Hidden Worlds of the National Parks</a>.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sn_g80FXA-0"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
This Google Arts &amp; Culture exhibit and interactive documentary in honor of this month’s NPS Centennial is available on the web and in the Google Arts &amp; Culture App on <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/arts-culture/id1050970557"">iOS</a>/<a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.cultural"">Android</a>. You can immerse yourself in 360-degree video tours through some of the most remote and breathtaking places in five different National Parks. And if you want to learn more about what you’re seeing, you can <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/project/national-park-service"">browse the fascinating archive of artifacts</a> from the National Parks’ many museums.<br />
<br />
At each park, a local ranger guides you through places most people never get to go — spelunking through ancient caves at Carlsbad Caverns, flying above active volcanoes in Hawai’i, and swimming through the coral reefs of the Dry Tortugas in Florida. <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5w5PyKUBLHw"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
We’ve also created the <a href=""https://www.google.com/edu/expeditions/"">Hidden Worlds Expedition</a> for educators to help open up new learning opportunities and share these experiences with even more people. The Expedition can be accessed on the Expeditions App (available on Google Play in the U.S.).<br />

<div><i>Today's Doodle celebrating U.S. National Parks &amp; monuments. More info at <a href=""http://google.com/doodles"">google.com/doodles</a>.</i></div><br />
The National Parks are American treasures, and everyone should see what they have to offer. We hope that by making it easy for people to get a taste of the wilderness, we can encourage a new generation of parks goers to head out and explore in person. Get ready for an adventure!<br />

387480663780155253,,Google Blogs,2016-08-15T21:01:00-07:00,"Meet Google Duo, a simple 1-to-1 video calling app for everyone","Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person, but too often it can be a frustrating or complicated experience. You shouldn’t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are. It’s no wonder that nearly half of us never make video calls on mobile*. <br />
<br />
Today, we’re releasing <a href=""http://duo.google.com/"">Google Duo</a> — a simple 1-to-1 video calling app available for Android and iOS. Duo takes the complexity out of video calling, so that you can be together in the moment wherever you are.  <br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uEvNhN5pfv4/V7IPJ8l8GRI/AAAAAAAASyk/NORZTMUFpHYMa5byPHZB7nCTJZvdnTCdQCLcB/s1600/duo-PR-launch-screens_0003_screen-4.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""572"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uEvNhN5pfv4/V7IPJ8l8GRI/AAAAAAAASyk/NORZTMUFpHYMa5byPHZB7nCTJZvdnTCdQCLcB/s640/duo-PR-launch-screens_0003_screen-4.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div>
<i>Google Duo works across Android and iOS — all you need is a phone number</i><br />
<b><br />
Simple interface</b><br />
Duo is simple from start to finish. To get started, all you need is your phone number and you’ll be able to reach people in your phone’s contacts list. No separate account is required, so you can sign up in just a few steps. From there, you can instantly begin a video call with a single tap.<br />
<br />
<b>Fast and reliable</b><br />
We all know how it feels when a call fails to connect or when video gets choppy. We’ve built Duo to be fast and reliable, so that video calls connect quickly and work well even on slower networks. Call quality adjusts to changing network conditions to keep you connected — when bandwidth is limited, Duo will gracefully reduce the resolution to keep the call going smoothly. For video calls on the go, Duo will switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call. You can start your call at home, and continue seamlessly even when you head out the door.<br />
<br />
<b>Human design</b><br />
We designed Duo to feel warm and inviting, focused on just you and the person you’re calling. To make calls feel more like an invitation rather than an interruption, we created a feature in Duo called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIeMysX76pM"">Knock Knock</a> which lets you see live video of your caller before you answer, giving you a sense of what they’re up to and why they want to chat. Knock Knock makes video calling more spontaneous and welcoming, helping you connect with the person before you even pick up.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

<i>Knock Knock in Duo lets you see who’s calling before you pick up</i><br />
<br />
Finally, we built Duo with an emphasis on privacy and security, and all Duo calls are end-to-end encrypted.<br />
<br />
Give your friends a wave with Duo! We’re beginning to roll out Duo for <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tachyon"">Android</a> and <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1096918571?mt=8"">iOS</a> today, and it will be live worldwide in the next few days.<br />

Now, thanks to the wonders of technology, you can now explore the ""Marvelous City"" and its rich cultural heritage even if you can't make the trip. We partnered with eight of Rio's top cultural institutions to create an <a href=""http://g.co/riodejaneiro"">interactive online collection</a> of some of the city’s most famous art exhibits and landmarks, including some inspiring real-life stories from the city's favelas, all available&nbsp;on <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/u/0/"">Google Arts &amp; Culture</a>.

<b>Mapping the whole city</b><br />
A huge part of Rio’s history and culture resides in the hillside favelas that dot the landscape. In fact, one in five Rio residents live in favelas, but only 0.001 percent of the city's favelas appear on the map. That means 1.4 million people have no addresses to list on job applications or bank accounts, and aren’t able to access many economic opportunities, essential services, even basic rights as citizens. So we teamed up with local NGO Grupo Cultural AfroReggae to map the favelas. Two years later, streets and 10,000+ local businesses in 26 favelas now appear on Google Maps, thanks to ""<a href=""http://www.tanomapa.org/"">Tá no Mapa</a>,"" our ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1bGwRcyVNk"">On the Map</a>"" project.<br />

Beyond the Map</b><br />
Along the way, we met some amazing people with remarkable stories, so we decided it was time to go ""<a href=""http://g.co/beyondthemap"">Beyond the Map</a>"" and shine a spotlight on an often overlooked side of Rio. With AfroReggae's help, we brought Street View and 360° technology to favelas for the first time, creating an immersive experience that lets you go beyond GPS coordinates and get to know the people and culture of communities that many people otherwise wouldn't get the chance to visit. You can even experience what it feels like to zip through the narrow streets of a favela on a motorcycle taxi!<br />

Whether it’s making the BLUE STEEL face from <i>Zoolander</i>, swapping tips on playing <i>Monument Valley</i>, or reading <i>Dragons Love Tacos</i> to the kids at bedtime, these shared moments bring us closer together.<br />
<br />
For families like mine, who bond over shared entertainment, we’re introducing <a href=""http://g.co/FamilyLibrary"">Family Library</a>, a way for up to six family members to share purchases on <a href=""http://play.google.com"">Google Play</a>. When you buy an eligible app, game, movie, TV show, or book in the Play Store, you can now share it with your family—across devices—with no additional sign-up fee.<br />
<br />

<b>Share across your family’s devices</b><br />
Today’s families have a lot of devices, and it should be easy to share content no matter where we are or what we’re doing. Everyone in my family loves the <i>Star Wars</i> movies and we all want to be able to watch them, on our phones, tablets, laptops, or TV.  All purchases added to Family Library are available across Android devices, and movies, TV shows, and books can be enjoyed on iOS devices and the web.<br />
<br />
<b>Easily manage sharing and family purchases</b><br />
As with most family matters, flexibility and choice is important. With Family Library, you can choose which items you want to share and which to keep to yourself—for example, I’ll probably keep my collection of comic books in my personal library. Flexibility is also built into your purchasing options. When you sign up, you’ll select a credit card to share as your family payment method, but your family members will always have the option of buying stuff with their personal credit cards or gift cards. And for your younger family members, you’ll have the option to approve each of their purchases.<br />
<br />
<b>Share a Music subscription with your family</b><br />
Finally, if your family loves music, you can also subscribe to the <a href=""https://play.google.com/music/listen?signup=1&coupon=FAMILYSTANDARD&coupontype=VANITY"">Google Play Music family plan</a>. On this plan, up to six family members can stream millions of songs on demand for $14.99 a month. We <a href=""https://android.googleblog.com/2015/12/google-play-music-now-playing-for-your.html"">launched</a> the family plan late last year, and today we’re expanding it to Ireland, Italy, Mexico, and New Zealand. And you can now sign up on the web, in addition to your Android device.<br />
<br />
Starting today, Family Library will be rolling out over the next few days and will be available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. To get started, <a href=""http://g.co/FamilyLibrary"">sign up</a> in Google Play, invite your family members, and start sharing what you love!<br />

6120145066092587209,,Google Blogs,2016-07-19T21:00:00-07:00,The art of collaboration: from Sheets to the streets,"Warhol &amp; Basquiat. Buñuel &amp; Dalí. Rauschenberg &amp; Johns. There are countless examples of artists collaborating to bring a shared creative vision to life. So we wondered: Could technology help bring together two artists who might not otherwise meet? What would they create…if their canvas were a spreadsheet? And how could we celebrate and share their work of art with the world?<br />
<br />
In partnership with <a href=""http://refinery29.com/"">Refinery29</a>, a lifestyle digital media company, we linked up with renowned illustrators <a href=""http://marinaesmeraldo.com/"">Marina Esmeraldo</a> in Barcelona, and <a href=""https://mallory-heyer.squarespace.com/"">Mallory Heyer</a> in NYC. We gave them a simple creative assignment—to “break the grid”—which literally can mean pushing the “grid” of <a href=""http://google.com/sheets/about"">Google Sheets</a> to its limits, but also taps into the idea of supporting and celebrating women globally who break free of confined roles and ways of thinking, which is core to Refinery29's mission.<br />
<br />
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/eTjjhLi0Xtk"" width=""560""></iframe></div>
<br />
Marina and Mallory connected a handful of times on Google Hangouts to plan and sketch out ideas, and creatively “hack” Sheets in order to make art: resizing cells into thousands of pixel-like squares, merging cells to create color blocks, creating vibrant color gradients with <a href=""https://support.google.com/docs/answer/78413?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en"">conditional formatting</a> and cell values, and other cool things we had no idea you could do with Sheets.<br />
<br />
The <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SqtrsRgUKRcAL1UX4X78VYe02moZck-SXTzhYzXbg_M/edit?usp=sharing"">result</a> was a bright, beautiful design that celebrates the diversity and strength of women, and we wanted to share their finished project in a BIG way.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ilBEKj-tNAs/V46Ia5PH5UI/AAAAAAAAcIc/2CBGHviRwEglJ1eA8CIB2sYjrwQ2mfsxwCEw/s1600/final_art%2B%25281%2529.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""262"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ilBEKj-tNAs/V46Ia5PH5UI/AAAAAAAAcIc/2CBGHviRwEglJ1eA8CIB2sYjrwQ2mfsxwCEw/s640/final_art%2B%25281%2529.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div>
The final step was to convert Marina and Mallory’s final piece from the cells of a spreadsheet to the bricks of a giant wall—to go from Sheets to the streets. So, we turned to <a href=""http://colossalmedia.com/"">Colossal Media</a>, a Brooklyn-based company that hand-paints murals all over the world.<br />
<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/NRoj8SAWHXA"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
After hand-mixing each of the colors and prepping the artwork for large-scale painting, Colossal spent five days painting each cell, letter, and gradient by hand, to create a 13’ x 34’ mural of the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SqtrsRgUKRcAL1UX4X78VYe02moZck-SXTzhYzXbg_M/edit?usp=sharing"">spreadsheet</a>. <br />
<br />
And that’s how art was #madewithGoogleSheets.<br />
<br />
To see it for yourself, check out Marina &amp; Mallory’s spreadsheet or head to <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bogart+St+%26+Thames+St,+Brooklyn,+NY+11206/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c25c00dfea51e3:0x338a49ce42a22961?sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7qoDY6eTNAhVMgx4KHRUdD0IQ8gEIGzAA"">Bogart &amp; Thames</a> in Brooklyn to visit the wall in person (until August 14). We're delighted by the creativity and imagination brought about by artistic collaboration, and proud to be associated with the work’s inspirational message supporting strong women everywhere.<br />

We’re sure you’ll want to see some of the artworks in real life too—and the Google Arts &amp; Culture app is there to help. Click “Visit” on a museum’s page to get opening times, find out what’s on that day and navigate there in one click. We’ve also been experimenting with a new feature. The Art Recognizer is now available in London’s <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/partner/dulwich-picture-gallery"">Dulwich Picture Gallery</a>, Sydney’s <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/partner/art-gallery-of-new-south-wales"">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a> and the <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/partner/national-gallery-of-art-washington-dc"">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington DC. Just pull up the app, point your phone’s camera to a painting on display and find all the information you want to know about the artwork. We’re planning to roll this out to museums around the world—so stay tuned.<br />

5706194207748994329,,Google Blogs,2016-07-15T09:59:00-07:00,A voice for everyone in 2016,"Every election matters and every vote counts. The American democracy relies on everyone’s participation in the political process. This November, Americans all across the country will line up at the polls to cast their ballots for the President of the United States. With states’ varied deadlines and methods, the voter registration process can be tricky. So starting on Monday, we're introducing a new tool in Search to simplify the voter registration process to make it easier for you to have your voice heard.<br />
<br />
Now when you search for “register to vote” or similar queries, Google will display a detailed state-by-state guide providing information on how to register, general requirements, and deadlines. <br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4dukmFT2xf4/V4kVgD1bKHI/AAAAAAAASr8/044Dc1KzJsw2HNbGp6q4ebBSbfxcsl0YACLcB/s1600/register.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4dukmFT2xf4/V4kVgD1bKHI/AAAAAAAASr8/044Dc1KzJsw2HNbGp6q4ebBSbfxcsl0YACLcB/s640/register.gif"" width=""299"" height=""640"" /></a></div><br />
No matter which state you’re in or how you plan to cast your ballot, you can find the step-by-step information you need to register correctly and on time—right at the top of your Search page and in the Google app. <br />
<br />
And for the kickoff of the <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=rnc"">Republican National Convention</a> next week (and coming in time for the Democratic National Convention the following week), when you search for these events on the Google app, you’ll find a summary of the event, nominees and the lineup of speakers. You’ll also find a livestream video from YouTube, and relevant social media posts, so you can stay up-to-date with both the political parties and the public. <br />
<br />
We hope these new features in Search will help keep you informed this election season and make it easier for you to make it to the ballot box in November.<br />

<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zV4br6UJqbY/V4cLatyojtI/AAAAAAAASqY/hJ4-qs6zV6QoQErAQtoicCNRG0u_SSIUQCLcB/s1600/6emoji1.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""171"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zV4br6UJqbY/V4cLatyojtI/AAAAAAAASqY/hJ4-qs6zV6QoQErAQtoicCNRG0u_SSIUQCLcB/s640/6emoji1.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></div>but with options like these for women:<br />

So we've been working to make things better.<br />
<br />
In May, we <a href=""http://unicode.org/L2/L2016/16160-emoji-professions.pdf"">proposed</a> a set of new emoji to the Unicode Technical Committee that represent a wider range of professions for women (as well as men), and reflect the pivotal roles that women play in the world. Since then, we've worked closely with members of the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee to bring the proposal to life.<br />
<br />
Today, the <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16181-gender-zwj-sequences.pdf"">Unicode Emoji Subcommittee has agreed</a> to add 11 new professional emoji, in both male and female options and with all the skin tones. That’s more than 100 new emoji to choose from!<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yGGIugBckBI/V4cKZZV91xI/AAAAAAAASqE/YWBR0qZlc8oChw8Eob5BKpyN5RV5rJanQCLcB/s1600/skintones_b.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""480"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yGGIugBckBI/V4cKZZV91xI/AAAAAAAASqE/YWBR0qZlc8oChw8Eob5BKpyN5RV5rJanQCLcB/s640/skintones_b.gif"" width=""640"" /></a></div><br />
Unicode is also adding male and female versions to 33 existing emoji. For example, you'll be able to pick both a female runner emoji and a male runner emoji, or a man or woman getting a haircut:<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tMxfavd49nw/V4cKiakuS3I/AAAAAAAASqI/jtzxN_By9xgcgp1NkY-JoGqwq1QZo64OQCLcB/s1600/gender.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""480"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tMxfavd49nw/V4cKiakuS3I/AAAAAAAASqI/jtzxN_By9xgcgp1NkY-JoGqwq1QZo64OQCLcB/s640/gender.gif"" width=""640"" /></a></div>These additions can be included in future versions of Android and other platforms—because Unicode helps make sure that people with different phones can send and receive the same emoji.<br />
<br />
These new emoji are one of <a href=""http://google.com/diversity"">several efforts</a> we’re making to better represent women in technology, and to connect girls with the education and resources they need to pursue careers in STEM. One such effort is Made with Code, which helps girls pursue and express their passions using computer science. Ahead of World Emoji Day this weekend, <a href=""https://www.madewithcode.com/"">Made with Code</a> is releasing a <a href=""https://www.madewithcode.com/projects/emoji"">new project</a> that teaches coding skills through the creation of emoji-inspired stickers.<br />

2246143276113583058,,Google Blogs,2016-06-30T14:17:00-07:00,Focusing on diversity,"It’s been two years since we first shared our workforce demographics and helped spark a conversation about the need to improve <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/05/05/google-raises-stakes-diversity-spending/26868359/"">diversity at Google</a> and across the tech industry. Today we’re updating <a href=""http://www.google.com/diversity/"">google.com/diversity</a> with our 2015 demographics, and sharing some areas where we’ve seen progress in building a more diverse and inclusive Google.<br />
<br />
<b>More women in technical and leadership roles </b><br />
Women now comprise 31 percent of all Googlers, and we’ve seen strong growth of women in technical and leadership roles. Similar to last year, one in five of our technical hires in 2015 were women, helping bring the total number of women in technical roles from 18 to 19 percent. Additionally, women now hold 24 percent of leadership roles across Google—up from 22 percent.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-azaloQ-3oEQ/V3WGbwc8-pI/AAAAAAAASn4/ZSz2d9gbJzwuWKyQwg31LNoNYPZdqWUqQCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-04-22%2Bat%2B9.40.24%2BAM.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-azaloQ-3oEQ/V3WGbwc8-pI/AAAAAAAASn4/ZSz2d9gbJzwuWKyQwg31LNoNYPZdqWUqQCLcB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-04-22%2Bat%2B9.40.24%2BAM.png"" /></a></div><br />
<b>Overall hiring progress</b><br />
For the first time this year, we’re sharing the percentage of our hires who are Black and Hispanic. In 2015, our hiring for Black, Hispanic, and female Googlers grew faster than our current demographic representation for each of these groups. And our Hispanic Googlers in technical roles increased from 2 to 3 percent.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sp5kLlhtGTc/V3WGhnUMhCI/AAAAAAAASoA/9JRc9sEPCggK-_VSxJ5LNlq38rJ0deRJQCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-04-22%2Bat%2B9.57.58%2BAM.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sp5kLlhtGTc/V3WGhnUMhCI/AAAAAAAASoA/9JRc9sEPCggK-_VSxJ5LNlq38rJ0deRJQCLcB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-04-22%2Bat%2B9.57.58%2BAM.png"" /></a></div><i>This data reflects the gender composition of Google’s global technical workforce and the race & ethnicity composition of Google’s U.S. workforce as of January 1, 2016. For more stats, visit google.com/diversity.</i><br />
<br />
<b>Building an Inclusive Culture</b><br />
Hiring is important, but it’s equally important to make workplaces inclusive, fair and supportive for all employees. We’re continuing to build a culture where Googlers can grow, thrive and want to stay. We want to build a place where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas and opinions—and empowered to grow their careers.<br />
<br />
We check and recheck processes like promotion and performance reviews to make sure they’re producing equitable outcomes, and address any gaps we find. For example, Googlers in engineering or product management roles are able to nominate themselves for promotion, and in 2010 we discovered that women in technical roles were less likely than men to self-nominate. We found that with a <a href=""http://www.wnyc.org/story/google-test-case-gender-bias/"">small nudge</a>—emailing these findings to all technical Googlers—the rate of women self-nominating went up and now the gap between men and women has closed.<br />
<br />
Compensation is another example. We’ve long had <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2016/04/29/how-the-whats-your-current-salary-question-hurts-the-gender-pay-gap/"">gender pay equity in our workforce</a>, and we recently shared <a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/pay-equity/steps/introduction/"">our approach to compensation</a> with the hope that other companies will adopt similar fair pay practices. <br />
<br />
We also continue <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/05/12/google-unconscious-bias-diversity/27055485/"">to invest in our unconscious bias trainings</a>. Over 65 percent of Googlers have participated in our unbiasing workshops, and all new Googlers take the workshop as part of their orientation. We’ve shared these materials and research on our platform <a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/unbiasing/"">re:Work with Google</a> so anyone from any industry can create unbiasing trainings for their team. <br />
<br />
We saw encouraging signs of progress in 2015, but we’re still far from where we need to be. To learn more about our diversity and inclusion efforts, hear from leaders across Google:<br />

692856713502869623,,Google Blogs,2016-06-29T09:00:00-07:00,Supporting Bay Area nonprofits focused on homelessness,"“How many homeless people are in San Francisco?” “How do people become homeless?” “How can I help homeless people?”<br />
<br />
These are just some of the questions people ask Google about homelessness in San Francisco, according to <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_t62vdFUBAABNWM_en"">Google Trends</a>. Many of these questions don’t have simple answers, and <a href=""http://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/letters-from-the-mayors/"">decades of efforts</a> have not significantly moved the needle. There are more than 6,600 homeless people in the city, many of whom are children. People who experience homelessness often struggle from chronic stress, trauma, and frequent moves, and are unable to take advantage of many educational or economic opportunities.<br />
<br />
We want to do our part in tackling this complex issue. Since 2014, Google.org has invested more than $5 million in Bay Area nonprofits who are working to combat homelessness, and today we’re committing an additional $1.2 million for these efforts. The Google News Lab is also <a href=""http://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/"">joining the San Francisco Chronicle and 70+ news outlets</a> across the country to help raise awareness as part of the Beyond Homelessness initiative, launching today. <br />
<br />

In San Francisco and across the Bay area, these 10 organizations provide a range of services and programs focused on rapid re-housing and prevention, basic services, job training and more. Our newest grantee, <a href=""http://destinationhomescc.org/"">Destination: Home</a>, plans to use their $1 million grant to build a rapid re-housing system for homeless families in Mountain View and Sunnyvale in the form of security deposits, motel stays, time-limited rental assistance, move-in assistance, and a support system to make sure individuals and families find stable housing. <br />
<br />
<a href=""https://handup.org/"">HandUp</a> has helped both homeless and low-income individuals and families overcome poverty via a giving platform that connects donors directly with neighbors who are struggling to meet basic needs. <a href=""http://streetsteam.org/"">The Downtown Streets Team</a> provides a work experience program for homeless men and women through beautification projects in San Francisco’s Civic Center/Mid-Market neighborhoods. And <a href=""http://lavamae.org/"">Lava Mae</a> is expanding their mobile showers for the homeless to Los Angeles with an additional $200K in Google.org grant funding. <br />

One in 25 kids in San Francisco Unified School District are homeless, and many families face at least a nine-month wait list for temporary shelter. In 2015, we supported the <a href=""https://hamiltonfamilycenter.org/"">Hamilton Family Center</a> (HFC) with a $1 million grant aimed to reduce the homeless family wait list for shelter by creating direct lines of communication with SFUSD teachers and staff to report and respond to new and potential cases of homelessness.  HFC has already seen a 25 percent reduction in the family wait list, and hopes to continue that momentum. <br />
Homelessness in our cities is a challenge decades in the making—and will require continued innovation and dedication to solve. We’re committed to helping, through financial support, volunteering and raising awareness. Find out more about this issue on <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_t62vdFUBAABNWM_en"">our Google Trends site</a> and join us in finding solutions by visiting <a href=""http://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/"">Beyond Homelessness</a> or contributing to any of our grantee organizations.<br />

Follow along on their <a href=""http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/"">blog</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleForEdu"">Twitter</a> for the latest news and updates. -Ed.</i></div><br />
Great teachers inspire us, listen to us and learn from us; they bring the most mundane subjects to life. Technology can help great teachers do what they do best—stimulating minds and fostering skills in the next generation—and make learning even more rewarding for students. So we’re excited by the <a href=""http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2016/06/updates-from-iste-4-new-tools-to-help.html"">updates and improvements to our tools for the classroom</a> we’re announcing this week at the <a href=""https://conference.iste.org/2016/"">ISTE conference</a>, one of the largest education technology gatherings in the world.<br />
<br />
<b>Expeditions for all</b><br />
Since we launched the Expeditions Pioneer Program last September, more than a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MQ9yG_QfDA"">million students</a> from 11 countries have taken one of our 200+ virtual reality trips—from the Great Barrier Reef, to the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu. Today, we’re making Expeditions available to everyone. To get started, all teachers need to do is download the <a href=""http://www.google.com/edu/expeditions"">Expeditions app</a> onto a set of devices and choose where in the world they want to take their class. The app is <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.vr.expeditions"">available today for Android</a> and will be available for iPhones and iPads soon. <br />
<br />
While Expeditions can be used with many of the devices schools or students already have, <a href=""http://www.bestbuy.com/GoogleExpeditions"">Best Buy Education</a> will also be making Expeditions kits available for schools to purchase. These kits will contain everything teachers need to bring their classes on amazing Expeditions: a tablet, virtual reality viewers and a router to connect them all. <br />

Sharing information on the classroom’s big screen helps students learn from one another. But today, students have to physically connect their computers to the projector to share their screens with the class. To open classroom collaboration and bring projecting into the 21st century, we’re announcing <a href=""http://g.co/castforedu"">Google Cast for Education</a>, a free Chrome app that lets students and teachers share their screens wirelessly from everywhere in the classroom, no new hardware required. Cast for Education carries video and audio across complex school networks, has built-in controls for teachers, and is integrated with <a href=""http://www.google.com/edu/classroom"">Google Classroom</a>.<br />

<b>Quizzes in Google Forms</b><br />
Getting feedback helps students learn and teachers teach. But grading tests and quizzes is time-consuming; teachers often have to take time away from other tasks to do it, and if it’s not done promptly, everyone misses out on the opportunity to learn from the things students got wrong. Starting today, <a href=""https://goo.gl/ZfwK68"">Quizzes in Google Forms</a> will grade multiple choice and checkbox questions automatically—so teachers can spend less time grading work and more time teaching. <br />
<br />
Teachers can set correct answers in Forms and even add review materials in the form of explanations, supplemental websites, or review videos—so students can get quick, informative feedback on how to improve. Plus, teachers can get an instant snapshot on what their students understand, so they know which lessons need more explanation or what to teach next.<br />

Teachers tell us educational apps on Chromebooks help them improve skills like problem-solving, teamwork, communication and creativity. In collaboration with teachers at EdTechTeacher, we’re announcing a collection of creative apps on Chromebooks that schools can now purchase at a discount: <a href=""http://explaineverything.com/chromebooks/"">Explain Everything</a>, <a href=""https://www.soundtrap.com/edu/"">Soundtrap</a>, and <a href=""https://www.wevideo.com/education"">WeVideo</a>. These apps let students demonstrate their understanding of curriculum in their own way by creating unique animations, music, and videos.<br />

As technology becomes an integral component of our classrooms, we also want it to be so easy to use that it fades into background, allowing teachers to spend their time doing what they love: engaging and inspiring students. <br />

3248683752467544031,,Google Blogs,2016-06-23T16:30:00-07:00,Be who you are. Love who you love. #prideforeveryone,"Everyone has the fundamental right to express who they are, yet all too often we bear witness to hatred and violence directed at people who peacefully and lovingly pursue happiness. The mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, earlier this month is a horrifying example.<br />
<br />
Google’s mission has always been to make information universally accessible. And within that mission lies the belief that the more knowledge we have, the more tolerant, inclusive and respectful the world ultimately will be. <br />
<br />
Pride is a time when those who have access to vibrant LGBTQ communities take to the streets to celebrate the freedom to live and love. Yet there are still multitudes of lesbian, gay, bi, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people in the U.S. and around the world who are lonely and ostracized—who cannot participate in Pride due to strict anti-LGBTQ laws or social stigma.<br />
<br />
To bridge this gap, we've created <a href=""http://google.com/prideforeveryone"">#prideforeveryone</a>—a virtual reality Pride experience that anyone can access. For the past several weeks, Googlers from 25 countries have been marching in their local Pride parades to document the truly global face of the LGBTQ community in 360 degrees. This VR montage, available via YouTube 360 and Google Cardboard, is the result.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/6oDLqmM2BPw"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
Google has a long track record of leadership in LGBTQ rights, including taking a stand <a href=""http://www.google.com/doodles/2014-winter-olympics"">against discrimination in sports</a> at the Sochi Olympic games, becoming <a href=""http://www.advocate.com/business/2011/11/22/google-transgender-gold-standard"">one of the first companies to provide full coverage of transgender employee healthcare</a>, and <a href=""http://www.advocate.com/business/2011/11/22/google-transgender-gold-standard"">standing up for same-sex and domestic partner rights</a> and benefits in places around the world where they may not otherwise exist. <br />
<br />
Even in the U.S., where we’ve achieved greater levels of equality, only <a href=""http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/06/13/a-survey-of-lgbt-americans/"">52 percent of the LGBTQ population</a> have ever participated in a parade. Transgender people face legislation that effectively dehumanizes them. In Orlando, the LGBTQ community bore the brunt of the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. This is simply wrong.<br />
<br />
With #prideforeveryone, we stand prouder than ever in our embrace of the LGBTQ community. As always, we invite others to stand with us.<br />

In London, Josh Babarinde created <a href=""http://crackedit.org/"">Cracked It</a>, a social enterprise that trains at-risk youth to repair cracked smartphone screens, giving them an alternative to crime. In Seoul, Yeram Kwon is transforming the CPR training experience with improved, smarter manikins through <a href=""http://www.heartisense.com/"">HeartiSense</a>. And in Israel, Oded Ben-Dov created <a href=""https://sesame-enable.com/"">Sesame Enable</a>, the first touch-free smartphone designed for people who have limited or no use of their hands due to disabilities.<br />
<br />
As a company created by two graduate students in a garage, we know just how powerful an entrepreneur with an idea can be. We also know there’s more that companies, governments, and communities can do to help those entrepreneurs succeed. That’s why we <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/09/celebrating-spirit-of-entrepreneurship.html"">created</a> <a href=""https://www.googleforentrepreneurs.com/"">Google for Entrepreneurs</a> nearly four years ago—to support startup communities around the world and connect entrepreneurs to resources and to each other. <br />
<br />
This week, we’re excited to participate in and sponsor the <a href=""http://www.ges2016.org/"">Global Entrepreneurship Summit</a>, hosted by President Barack Obama and the U.S. government, building upon summits previously hosted by the governments of Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Morocco, and Kenya. The summit showcases entrepreneurs and investors from around the world who are creating new opportunities for investment, partnership, and collaboration. Our CEO Sundar Pichai is speaking at Friday’s closing session, and a number of other Google leaders will be there to discuss the state of entrepreneurship around the world and ways that we can all support startups and encourage innovation. <br />
<br />
Helping entrepreneurs succeed also means building and investing resources in the communities where they live and work. That’s why Google for Entrepreneurs partners with more than 50 organizations worldwide, and runs six <a href=""https://www.campus.co/"">Campus</a> spaces—in London, Tel Aviv, Seoul, Madrid, Warsaw, and São Paulo—where local entrepreneurs can work and learn. Altogether, we work with entrepreneurs in 125 countries, who have raised more than $1 billion in funding and created 5,000+ new jobs.<br />
<br />
Our support of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit is another way we hope to help entrepreneurs build and create the technology that will shape our future. To the 1,500 attendees joining from around the world, we warmly welcome you to Silicon Valley and hope to meet you! If you’re attending the Summit, please stop by the Google for Entrepreneurs lounge, where you can sign up for 1:1 mentorship from dozens of Googlers and industry experts, explore product demos, and more. We’re also hosting an interactive portal experience to connect attendees from the event to entrepreneurs around the world at Campus London, Campus Seoul, <a href=""http://centraal.com/"">Centraal</a> in Mexico, and in Iraq and Afghanistan. And for those that can’t join us in person, you can catch the action via <a href=""http://youtube.com/Ges2016"">live stream</a>. <br />

8724854581499994099,,Google Blogs,2016-06-20T09:00:00-07:00,I’m Feeling Yucky :(  Searching for symptoms on Google,"Picture this: you woke up today with a headache. It’s been getting worse all day, and you aren’t sure if you should be worried or not. So you open <a href=""http://g.co/googleapp"">the Google app</a> and start searching for your symptoms. After 20 minutes digging through health forums, chances are you're overwhelmed by all the complicated medical terms and breaking out in a sweat—whether that’s related to the headache or the overdose of info is unclear!<br />
<br />
You’re not alone. Roughly 1 percent of searches on Google (think: <i>millions!</i>) are symptom-related. But health content on the web can be difficult to navigate, and tends to lead people from mild symptoms to scary and unlikely conditions, which can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress.<br />
<br />
So starting in the coming days, when you ask Google about symptoms like “<a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&amp;q=headache+on+one+side"">headache on one side</a>,” we’ll show you a list of related conditions (“headache,” “migraine,” “tension headache,” “cluster headache,” “sinusitis,” and “common cold”). For individual symptoms like “<a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&amp;q=headache"">headache</a>,” we’ll also give you an overview description along with information on self-treatment options and what might warrant a doctor’s visit. By doing this, our goal is to help you to navigate and explore health conditions related to your symptoms, and quickly get to the point where you can do more in-depth research on the web or talk to a health professional. <br />
<br />
We create the list of symptoms by looking for health conditions mentioned in web results, and then checking them against high-quality medical information we’ve collected from doctors for our <a href=""http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html"">Knowledge Graph</a>. We worked with a team of medical doctors to carefully review the individual symptom information, and experts at Harvard Medical School and Mayo Clinic evaluated related conditions for a representative sample of searches to help improve the lists we show.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U5XJ9tHtkac/V2XImfC9WFI/AAAAAAAASkU/S-wT_db8KRIGEN-eVIeBEoz5PbZ-PXTSACLcB/s1600/Symptoms%2BSearch.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""427"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U5XJ9tHtkac/V2XImfC9WFI/AAAAAAAASkU/S-wT_db8KRIGEN-eVIeBEoz5PbZ-PXTSACLcB/s640/Symptoms%2BSearch.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><br />
That said, symptom search (like all medical information on Google) is intended for informational purposes only, and you should always consult a doctor for medical advice. We rely on search results, and we reflect what’s on the web. Because of this, your feedback is especially important to us; we’ll use it to keep improving the results we show. You’ll notice in the weeks following launch that when we show symptom search we’ll automatically ask you if the results are helpful. <br />
<br />
We’re rolling this update out on mobile over the next few days, in English in the U.S. to start. Over time, we hope to cover more symptoms, and we also want to extend this to other languages and internationally. So the next time you’re worried about your “<a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&amp;q=child+with+knee+pain"">child with knee pain</a>” (even though it’s probably just growing pains), or have some symptoms you’re too embarrassed to run by your roommate, a Google search will be a helpful place to start.<br />

5710726961866771652,,Google Blogs,2016-06-20T00:00:00-07:00,Showing support on World Refugee Day,"When Walaa posted a picture on social media that spoke out against violence in his hometown of Jairoud, Syria, it earned him three months of violent detention. He fled the country with his family through Turkey and into Greece, where they now live in a refugee camp near the Macedonian border.<br />
<br />
Though the Internet played a role in his flight from Syria, connectivity has played a crucial role in helping him rebuild his life in Greece. While living in Greek refugee camps, Walaa used YouTube to learn English, and his language skills are now so good that he’s served as a community advocate and translator. He says he’s far from done: next, he hopes to learn Greek.<br />
<br />
As refugees across Europe adapt to new contexts, access to information and education are crucial to help them develop the skills they need. Last fall we encouraged you to donate to a public matching campaign to help refugees access not only basic humanitarian aid, but also resources to create a bridge to their new communities. Since then we’ve helped the <a href=""http://www.rescue.org/"">International Rescue Committee</a> build an <a href=""https://refugeeinfo.eu/?language=en"">online information hub</a> for refugees, <a href=""https://www.mercycorps.org.uk/"">Mercy Corps</a> develop <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mercycorps.translationcards&amp;hl=en_GB"">Translation Cards</a> to allow field workers to communicate across languages more easily, partner with <a href=""http://nethope.org/"">NetHope</a> to install low-cost WiFi in refugee camps, and support refugee education through <a href=""https://kiron.ngo/"">Kiron</a>, a nonprofit providing refugee-tailored university courses available both online and offline. <br />
<br />
In addition to Walaa, we’ve heard from other refugees who are finding ways to adjust thanks to Internet and education access. For example, Ahmed is an Iraqi computer scientist now living in Berlin. While waiting for his residence permit, he began teaching coding classes at refugee welcome centers as part of <a href=""http://reconnect.nethope.org/"">Project Reconnect</a>, an initiative we launched with NetHope to equip NGOs with Chromebooks. Kashif, who traveled through seven countries from a small Pakistani town to Berlin, is studying online with Kiron and dreams of working as an engineer at NASA.<br />

We also want to thank everyone across the globe who <a href=""https://onetoday.google.com/page/refugeerelief/"">donated</a> last year, and encourage you to continue to support our partners in their critical work.

8600956972671986258,,Google Blogs,2016-06-17T09:02:00-07:00,Digital Love Letters for fathers who are incarcerated,"This past Mother's Day, we shared <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/love-letters-children-of-incarcerated.html"">#LoveLetters</a>, a partnership among nonprofits to give the children of incarcerated parents a chance to have their voices heard. Today, in celebration of Father’s Day, you can watch Love Letters for incarcerated fathers. This work is part of our continued commitment to <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/02/strengthening-our-commitment-to-racial.html"">raising awareness about racial injustice</a>, and to <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/02/26/bryan-stevenson-technology-industry-silicon-valley-diversity-google/80986922/"">bearing witness</a> to the human costs of mass incarceration. <br />
<br />
The costs of mass incarceration have disproportionately affected the lives of Black men. From 1980 to 2007, about <a href=""http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/03/02/us-drug-arrests-skewed-race"">one in three</a> of the 25.4 million adults arrested for drugs was African-American. And if that current trend continues, one in three Black boys born today can expect to spend time in prison during his lifetime. All in all, we’re now at a point where there are <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/antonio-moore/black-mass-incarceration-statistics_b_6682564.html"">more African-American men incarcerated</a> in the U.S. than the total prison populations of India, Argentina, Canada, Lebanon, Germany, Finland, Israel and England combined.<br />
<br />
<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/51Aw_eKKAzw"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<i>Children share digital “Love Letters” for their fathers who are incarcerated</i><br />
<br />
Many of these men are also fathers—and their children have suffered greatly. The loss of a father to incarceration <a href=""http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/02/25/parents-incarceration-takes-toll-on-children-studies.html"">adversely</a> affects children’s educational, social and emotional well-being, even decades later. <a href=""http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2014/incarcerated-parents-and-childrens-health.aspx"">Children with an incarcerated parent</a> are three times more likely to have behavioral problems or depression, and at least twice as likely to suffer from learning disabilities, ADD/ADHD, and anxiety. <br />
<br />
This is what Love Letters conveys: the hurt of the children left behind—and the enduring bond between a child and a parent despite the barrier of prison walls. So for Father's Day, we worked with the NGOs <a href=""http://popstheclub.com/"">Pops the Club</a> and <a href=""http://www.theplace4grace.org/"">Place4Grace</a> to encourage children and youth in California to share their love letters to their fathers behind bars. We're also working with the California Department of Corrections to share the video with fathers behind bars throughout the state.<br />
<br />
To learn about criminal justice reform legislation now going through Congress, visit <a href=""http://www.sentencingproject.org/"">sentencingproject.org</a>, <a href=""http://www.vera.org/"">vera.org</a>, or <a href=""http://www.brennancenter.org/"">brennancenter.org</a>. As David Drummond, Alphabet’s vice president of corporate development, said at an event this week: “We like disruption, and if there’s a system worth disrupting, it’s the criminal justice system.” We hope that by raising awareness about the impact of mass incarceration on children and families, we can help to change it. Please join us in this effort—watch the video and share with #LoveLetters on social media.<br />

6534096914125372305,,Google Blogs,2016-06-09T11:30:00-07:00,Tango: See more with a new kind of phone,"Your phone can help you navigate from one side of the country to the other, help you share memories with friends, or even identify the song that's playing right now. But it can’t answer basic (and important) questions like, “Where’s the nearest building exit?” or “Will this couch actually fit in my apartment?” That’s because while your phone may know where you are in the world, it doesn’t know where you are in the room. <br />
<br />
But, for the past three years, the Project Tango team has been working to help devices understand physical space and motion more like people do. Today we’re taking the next step with the first Tango-enabled phone (Lenovo’s <a href=""http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/tango/index.html?ipromoID=LEN264337"">PHAB2 Pro</a>). We’re also graduating the effort from Project Tango to, simply, Tango.<br />
<br />
<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/iHN4c7FYXYs"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<br />
Tango helps you answer a new set of questions about your world through specialized hardware and apps. Some of the coolest apps that work with Tango are the ones that overlay digital objects on top of your surroundings. For example if you’re shopping for a new bed, Tango lets you view your bedroom through your phone and visualize different options—even walk around the virtual furniture like it’s actually there.<br />
<br />
<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmXVMIRwuJQ"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<br />
With a Tango-enabled phone, you also have a toy box, a solar system, and a pet shop in your pocket.  You can play with a huge set of dominoes, explore the planets, defend yourself from invading aliens, or feed your virtual dog—all through your phone. The best part is that you don’t have to clean up afterwards. <br />
<br />
<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxTLOXzhqzA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<br />
In the future, we hope Tango can help you navigate a mall, museum or place you’ve never been. Tango can overlay directions to your destination, then provide more info once you arrive. We've already started to work on this—we previewed it in February with the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J45EpCuD3Pw"">National Art Museum of Catalunya</a>, and we plan to bring select locations online later this year.<br />
<br />
Whether you’re shopping, playing, or just finding your way around, Tango helps you explore the world in a new way. There are already lots of <a href=""https://get.google.com/tango/apps/"">great apps</a> exploring these new capabilities, and as Tango finds its way into more devices, there will be more to come. If you’d like to learn more, visit the <a href=""http://get.google.com/tango/"">Tango website</a>, or tune in to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spO3ugXq6Po"">Nat and Lo</a> for a behind-the-scenes look at Tango.<br />

5501102093201564387,,Google Blogs,2016-06-01T07:00:00-07:00,Celebrating My Account's first birthday with improvements and new controls,"<a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/06/privacy-security-tools-improvements.html"">A year ago today</a>, we launched <a href=""http://myaccount.google.com?utm_source=ogb-blog&utm_medium=blog-pr&utm_campaign=anniversary"">My Account</a>, a hub that gives you quick access to controls for safeguarding your data and protecting your privacy on Google. My Account puts privacy and security tools in one place, including long-standing features like Ads Settings and newer ones like the <a href=""https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup?utm_source=ogb-blog&utm_medium=blog-pr&utm_campaign=anniversary"">Privacy</a> and <a href=""https://security.google.com/settings/security/secureaccount?utm_source=ogb-blog&utm_medium=blog-pr&utm_campaign=anniversary"">Security</a> Checkups. Collectively, these tools make it easy for you to control your privacy and security from any device.<br />
<br />
In the past year, more than one billion people around the world have used My Account. Now, on the first anniversary of its launch, we're excited to introduce three new features to easily access your controls and protect your data.<br />
<br />
<b>A helping hand when you lose your phone</b><br />
We entrust our phones with some of our most personal data: texts from loved ones, family photos, work emails, bank account information, and more. In the wrong hands, that data could cause trouble. Unfortunately, <a href=""http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/06/smartphone-thefts-on-the-decline/index.htm"">millions of phones</a> are stolen every year in the U.S. alone, and countless more are lost in taxis, cafes, and couch cushions around the world. But when your phone goes missing, it’s not always easy to figure out where to start, who to call, or how to keep your information safe. <br />
<br />
<a href=""http://myaccount.google.com/find-your-phone?utm_source=ogb-blog&utm_medium=blog-pr&utm_campaign=anniversary"">Find your phone</a> is a new feature that will help you if your phone is ever lost or stolen. In a few simple steps, you can not only locate your phone, but also lock and call it, secure your account, leave a callback number on the screen, and more. The feature can be used to find lost Android and iOS devices, and soon, you’ll also be able to access it by searching Google for “I lost my phone.”<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3DLURs6CjkU/V05qzjDeFOI/AAAAAAAASao/dlzzPNUT1uU-6Ru2Tf2ErBZL5vJ4A-aPACLcB/s1600/findyourphone.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3DLURs6CjkU/V05qzjDeFOI/AAAAAAAASao/dlzzPNUT1uU-6Ru2Tf2ErBZL5vJ4A-aPACLcB/s640/findyourphone.png"" /></a></div><b>New ways to access My Account</b><br />
People are increasingly using their voices to navigate apps and services—for example, mobile voice searches on Google have tripled in the past two years. So, we’re making it easier to get to My Account just by using your voice. In the latest Google app you can simply say, “Ok Google, show me my Google account,” and we’ll take you right there. This is available today in English, with other languages coming soon.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0HdF3qXkw2I/V05q95KAntI/AAAAAAAASas/OELQ64M9LW8vEumjHWAXEyEtm_yQpOgxgCLcB/s1600/voice-search.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0HdF3qXkw2I/V05q95KAntI/AAAAAAAASas/OELQ64M9LW8vEumjHWAXEyEtm_yQpOgxgCLcB/s640/voice-search.png"" /></a></div>We’re also making it easier than ever to find My Account by searching Google.  Coming soon, you’ll be able to simply search for your own name, and if you’re signed in, you’ll see a shortcut to My Account.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tWrdJRsCucw/V05rGetEdvI/AAAAAAAASaw/RjefUGZuH7wUJEvsPNnEHncZNKQPzZXBwCLcB/s1600/my-account.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tWrdJRsCucw/V05rGetEdvI/AAAAAAAASaw/RjefUGZuH7wUJEvsPNnEHncZNKQPzZXBwCLcB/s640/my-account.png"" /></a></div>When you entrust your data to Google, you should expect powerful security and privacy controls. These features are just the latest in our ongoing efforts to protect you and your personal information. We'll continue to make updates based on your feedback.<br />

6612545538759418640,,Google Blogs,2016-05-27T12:00:00-07:00,"Google Photos: One year, 200 million users, and a whole lot of selfies","A year ago, <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/picture-this-fresh-approach-to-photos.html"">we introduced</a> Google Photos with one mission: To be a home for all your photos and videos, organized and brought to life, so that you can share and save what matters. <br />
<br />
Now 200 million of you are using Google Photos each month. We’ve delivered more than 1.6 billion animations, collages and movies, among other things. You’ve collectively freed up <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+GooglePhotos/posts/iuY2uPQWD17"">13.7 petabytes</a> of storage on your devices—it would take 424 years to swipe through that many photos! We’ve also applied 2 trillion labels, and 24 billion of those have been for ... selfies. <br />
<br />
To celebrate our first birthday, we’ve gathered a few of the team's favorite tips and updates we’ve made in the past year, so you can keep all that good stuff going... <br />
<br />
1. To fly through Google Photos on the web at photos.google.com, press Shift-? to see a list of keyboard shortcuts.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-85PAMBt3ATo/V0iXNXfXkgI/AAAAAAAASZI/pEsrqkmR_p82HQ-LkOZVGQpCdUd0f29twCLcB/s1600/Keyboard%2BShortcuts.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-85PAMBt3ATo/V0iXNXfXkgI/AAAAAAAASZI/pEsrqkmR_p82HQ-LkOZVGQpCdUd0f29twCLcB/s640/Keyboard%2BShortcuts.png"" /></a></div><br />
2. Narrow down your search results by searching for more than one thing at a time. Search for two people: “Mom and Dad,” or a person and a place: “Mom Yosemite,” a place and a thing: “Yosemite bear,” or a person and a thing: “Mom bear” to find that photo of your mama bear with the real bear.  <br />
<br />
3. Running out of Google storage? On photos.google.com, under settings, you can choose to convert all of your uploaded content from “Original quality” to the free “High quality” size to recover lots of space.<br />
<br />
4. Enter your favorite emoji (😎 🍂 💗 🎂 ) into search to pull up your corresponding photos. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQtGFBbwKEk"">Not joking</a>.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kuhNXZY7Ito/V0iVzMSCn_I/AAAAAAAASYk/6f9bjZraO1kgtCEOnONWyT8wULFdbYXNgCLcB/s1600/Emoji.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kuhNXZY7Ito/V0iVzMSCn_I/AAAAAAAASYk/6f9bjZraO1kgtCEOnONWyT8wULFdbYXNgCLcB/s400/Emoji.png"" /></a></div><br />
5. On photos.google.com, easily find the photos you recently uploaded by going to search, then choosing ""Show More” and then “Recently Added.” <br />
<br />
6. Tap into your device folders from the top of the albums page on Android, and see which folders are being backed up. Double-check that all those screenshots are safe!<br />
<br />
7. Create a shared album for your family. Every time someone adds a new photo, everyone will get a notification so they can see your latest photo or video.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IkmexYxLRtc/V0iXtw51Y0I/AAAAAAAASZY/ROODR7FEbRMGQ_ggKEjNO4NyXBnFqw6mACLcB/s1600/Shared%2BAlbums%2Bfamily.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IkmexYxLRtc/V0iXtw51Y0I/AAAAAAAASZY/ROODR7FEbRMGQ_ggKEjNO4NyXBnFqw6mACLcB/s640/Shared%2BAlbums%2Bfamily.png"" /></a></div><br />
8. Have you spied the easter egg in the photo editor on Android? Hint...It’s out of this world.<br />
<br />
9. Occasionally photos can appear out of order in your gallery—perhaps because the date was incorrectly set on your phone or camera when you took them. On photos.google.com, you can edit both the time and time zone of a photo or group of photos to put them in the right order in your library. Change one and they all get adjusted.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TRa9_3je6RM/V0iXYnlYVfI/AAAAAAAASZQ/AQXAzRc4rwIbuohN8FlFV26prO6EN06jQCLcB/s1600/Batch%2BEdit.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TRa9_3je6RM/V0iXYnlYVfI/AAAAAAAASZQ/AQXAzRc4rwIbuohN8FlFV26prO6EN06jQCLcB/s640/Batch%2BEdit.png"" /></a></div><br />
10. At the top of the albums page on mobile, scroll the carousel to the right and tap on the videos tile to get a view of all the videos in your library (on photos.google.com, you’ll see videos at the top of the album page).<br />
<br />
Thanks for a wonderful first year—keep it up; all those selfies aren’t going to take themselves!<br />

<b>Leonika Sari says:</b> I’m a developer and founder of the startup <a href=""http://reblood.com/"">Reblood</a>, which aims to awareness and promote blood donation in Indonesia. But in my downtime, I help people regain access to their Gmail accounts. Imagine not being able to access your Gmail or finding out your account was hijacked—it’s quite scary! I like helping people get back into their accounts so they can continue living their life.<br />
<br />
Answering posts in the Google Product Help Forums has also taught me a lot about how to run my startup. It’s shown me the importance of listening and replying to users. Google treats every piece of user feedback as a useful resource to improve the product—which inspires me to pay more attention to feedback about my own product and quickly turn that into product improvements. I also see parallels between the community of volunteers in the Top Contributor program and my own company Reblood’s community of donors. It makes me happy that I can help people, even those I’ve never met.<br />

<b>José says:</b> ​I work in the Systems and Education Innovation Department for Colegio Alameda de Osuna in Madrid. My son, Jorge, is studying psychology at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. We’re both passionate about helping and are members of the Top Contributor Program. I’m a TC and Jorge is a Rising Star, the entry level into the Top Contributor program.<br />
<br />
I was the first one to discover Google Product Help Forums. Helping people in the forums is very similar to teaching. It allows me to do something I like—teach—while enabling me to reach a much larger number of people than I would in the classroom. Plus, I get to learn more about tools I use in my job on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
<b>Jorge says:</b> My dad told me about the forums last summer when I was off from school. I thought I’d give it a try and now I’m hooked. I like it because helping others makes me feel good. When I was first starting, my dad would help me by suggesting solutions or showing me other ways of answering a question. Now that I’m back in school and busy with classes, the Top Contributor program helps us stay in touch. In fact, I think it improves our relationship.<br />
<br />
The Top Contributor program has brought us many great connections. The forums bring you closer to people, whether it’s through the questions you answer or the motivation to help that all the TCs share. And those bonds are something I wouldn’t change for anything.<br />

Read part two&nbsp;<a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/meet-more-of-our-top-contributors.html"">here</a>. - Ed.</i></div><br />
If you’ve ever asked a question about a Google product in the <a href=""https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!home;lang=en"">Google Product Help Forums</a> or on <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ghelp"">Twitter</a>, chances are you’ve encountered a <a href=""https://topcontributor.withgoogle.com/"">Top Contributor</a>—passionate Google product experts who enjoy sharing their knowledge with their fellow users. Last year, Top Contributors helped more than 55 million people with 30 different Google products, answering questions and providing tips. <br />
<br />
The super users in the Top Contributor program come from 60+ different countries. Their passion for our products and willingness to help others make them a community. To showcase the faces and stories behind this group of helpful users, we asked a few Top Contributors to share a bit about themselves. This is the first of two posts—come back tomorrow to learn more.<br />

<b>Jo says:</b> As a writer, editor, and all-around book enthusiast, I spend a lot of time using word-processing programs. I first discovered Google Docs when I saw a Chromebook ad on TV. I was intrigued by the idea of working in the cloud and not needing an external hard drive to backup my work.<br />
<br />
I use Docs for both my professional and personal writing and have completed works of nonfiction as well as novels in it. As senior editorial director at <a href=""https://www.bookpubco.com/"">Book Publishing Co.</a>, I use Docs for reviewing and editing manuscripts, writing copy, and communicating with authors and colleagues. My authors and colleagues are fascinated when we're in a document at the same time and they see me making changes. It looks like magic to them!<br />
<br />
Helping others navigate Docs might seem like an unusual hobby, but I love it. I like exercising my brain by exploring all that an app can do. It’s rewarding to answer users’ questions and help them solve conundrums, especially knowing that my reply could potentially reach hundreds or even thousands of others users who visit the forum with a similar issue. The occasional “thank you” or “you saved the day” is icing on the cake.<br />
<br />

<b>Kojo says:</b> I grew up in a small town in the central region of Ghana, the oldest of five children—which meant I learned how to work hard. Being the oldest meant I had to set a positive example for my siblings and cousins. I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in chemistry with honors from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, where I’m now a teaching and research assistant.<br />
<br />
I first got involved with Google products as a <a href=""https://www.google.com/edu/resources/programs/student-ambassador-program/"">Google Student Ambassador</a>, a program that gives students the opportunity to be a liaison between their university and Google. During that time, I gave tutorials to anyone from first year students to senior faculty in my department, teaching them how to incorporate Google apps like Drive, Docs, Sheets and Slides into their day-to-day. <br />
<br />
When I became a teaching and research assistant, I started using Google Forms to create short quizzes and Google Groups to send assignments and notes to the students in my lab experiment groups. Those experiences inspired me to start helping out in the forums, where I specialize in Nexus and Photos—products I don’t often get to use in the classroom. <br />
<br />
I love troubleshooting issues with products because it challenges me to pinpoint issues given very little information. It not only teaches me to solve problems, but it also shows me how I can interrelate things when teaching in order to help students. My experience there inspires me to take on more challenges elsewhere. Next up: grad school.<br />
<br />
<b>Get involved with the Top Contributor Program</b> <br />
We’re always looking for people around the world who have strong Google product knowledge, a friendly attitude, and enjoy helping others. If you’re interested in becoming a Top Contributor, start participating in a <a href=""https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!home;lang=en"">Google Product Forum</a> or on <a href=""http://goo.gl/helponsocial"">social media</a>, and <a href=""https://services.google.com/fb/forms/topcontributor/"">let us know you’re interested</a>. Once you’re helping people on a regular basis, you may be invited to become a Rising Star, the first level in the Top Contributor program. <br />

6680831578284626519,,Google Blogs,2016-05-24T11:35:00-07:00,10 things you may have missed at Google I/O,"Last week thousands of developers joined us at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, CA, at Google I/O, our annual developer conference, for three days of talks, sandboxes, and some festival fun. Here’s a look at I/O beyond the keynote:<br />
<br />
<b>1. It’s not just for grown-ups.</b><br />
A day before Google I/O officially began, we hosted <a href=""http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2016/05/inspiring-tomorrows-coders.html"">I/O Youth</a>. Over the course of the day, 120 students from Bay Area-based schools engaged in four hands-on activities focused on storytelling, designing, and coding. They heard from inspiring speakers that bring creative solutions to their jobs like Brent Bushnell, CEO of the entertainment company <a href=""http://twobitcircus.com/"">Two Bit Circus</a>, and Pavni Diwanji, who leads our Google-wide efforts to create a better experience for kids online. Check out 11-year-old Cindy Zhou’s <a href=""http://www.timeforkids.com/news/monster-magic/426121"">coverage of I/O Youth for <i>Time for Kids</i></a>.<br />

<b>2. Machine learning is already making products smarter.</b><br />
As Sundar said during his keynote, machine learning and artificial intelligence are changing computing in incredible ways. One of the biggest uncracked nuts in A.I. is understanding natural language. But we’re making progress, and we can see people are eager for it—on the Google app on Android, over 20 percent of the searches we get in the U.S. are now by voice. Ok Google!<br />
<br />
<b>3. ATAP is bridging the physical and the digital. </b><br />
On Friday, ATAP took the stage to share a glimpse of what’s going on in the ATAP garage. In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqCH4DNQBUA&amp;feature=youtu.be"">“Pearl,” an interactive 360 story</a> made for mobile by Academy award-winning director Patrick Osborne, a girl and her dad crisscross the country in their beloved hatchback. Project Jacquard introduced a twist on the iconic denim jacket—the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ-lcdMfziw&amp;feature=youtu.be"">Levi’s® Commuter™ Trucker Jacket</a>, with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grKHwQIaiaA"">Jacquard’s interactive fabrics</a> woven in. With the LG Electronics Inc. smartwatch and JBL by Harman speaker prototypes Project Soli demonstrated, you don’t have to touch a screen to view a message or change a song. And Ara showed off a developer version of their modular phone and provided a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWW5mQadZAY"">peek</a> into a future where phones can be customized for function and style. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tUVmGCDPXHU/V0SbkwCF1aI/AAAAAAAASVc/oCZbN7D5fK85PnXFROfbolstmSoIaTp2ACLcB/s1600/atap.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tUVmGCDPXHU/V0SbkwCF1aI/AAAAAAAASVc/oCZbN7D5fK85PnXFROfbolstmSoIaTp2ACLcB/s640/atap.gif"" width=""640"" /></a></div>
<i>The Soli smartwatch prototype (developed in collaboration with LG Electronics Inc.) is controlled without touching the screen</i><br />
<i><br />
</i> <b>4. We're working to make I/O more inclusive for everyone.</b><br />
As in past years, we made an effort to make I/O a diverse and welcoming conference for women and minorities who are underrepresented in technology. Women at I/O made up 23 percent of our 7,000+ attendees (at last year’s conference, women made up a similar percentage of our 5,000 attendees). We partnered with 13 community groups for women in technology, and offered travel grants to attendees making the trip. On Tuesday night, we hosted a <a href=""http://womentechmakers.com/"">Women Techmakers</a> dinner for 1,000 women.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a6xxyTQJAqs/V0SblNa6F_I/AAAAAAAASVg/g7nZZk-AssIUiUswNBRWtIo1E5-9TInywCLcB/s1600/womentechmakers.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""427"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a6xxyTQJAqs/V0SblNa6F_I/AAAAAAAASVg/g7nZZk-AssIUiUswNBRWtIo1E5-9TInywCLcB/s640/womentechmakers.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div>

<br />
We also want I/O to be more accessible for people with disabilities. To that end, we worked with Googlers and attendees with disabilities to provide things like real-time captioning for all breakout sessions at the conference.<br />
<br />
Finally, this was also the <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/05/16/google-io-works-to-close-the-race-and-gender-gap/84457548/"">first year we released ethnicity and race information</a> for a Google conference.<br />
<br />
<b>5. We’ve made custom hardware for machine learning.</b><br />
We designed and built a chip (of the silicon variety) that’s specifically made for machine learning. We call it a&nbsp;<a href=""https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html"">Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)</a> because it's tailored for TensorFlow, our machine learning software that’s openly available to all. A TPU is an order of magnitude (10x) more power efficient than a traditional computer chip—and TPUs were also the secret hardware sauce for AlphaGo, our <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/03/what-we-learned-in-seoul-with-alphago.html"">machine learning system that played and won 4 of 5 matches</a> with Lee Sedol in Korea.<br />
<br />
<b>6. The Google Play Music experience blended Google smarts with musical discovery.</b><br />
Not far from the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BFmgvgJwr0E/?taken-by=google"">dancing paint robot</a>, I/O’s Google Play Music room brought Google Search and Google Play Music together in perfect harmony. On the Play Connections Wall, you could explore connections between different artists, albums, and songs, powered by the Knowledge Graph. Nearby, a display with 3,000+ earphone jacks let you listen to songs from Google Play Music’s many different playlists, complete with LED lights that matched the mood of each song. The audio cables powering the display added up to 18,000 feet (3.4 miles)—almost as tall as Mount Kilimanjaro.<br />

<b>7. Android Pay is powering commutes in the U.K. and ATMs in the U.S.</b><br />
Last week we announced the first countries outside of the U.S. to get Android Pay, <a href=""http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2016/05/android-pay-now-in-uk-new-countries-on.html"">starting with the U.K.</a>&nbsp;Londoners will also be able to use Android Pay across the Transport for London network, including on the tube, bus, and rail. That’s 13 million journeys where you can now just tap and pay. In the U.S., Bank of America customers will be able to start using their phones to withdraw money in ATMs across the country starting in June. <br />
<br />
<b>8. Your favorite Google apps are coming to Daydream.</b><br />
As part of our <a href=""https://developers.googleblog.com/2016/05/vr-at-google-jump-expeditions-and.html"">effort to make VR even more accessible and immersive</a>, we’re planning to bring some of your favorite Google apps to Daydream, including Play Movies, Street View, Google Photos, and YouTube. The <a href=""https://youtube.googleblog.com/2016/05/a-youtube-experience-like-nothing-youve.html"">YouTube VR app</a> will provide an easier, more immersive way to find and experience virtual reality content on YouTube. Look out for it sometime later this year. <br />

<b>9. Android apps are coming to a Chromebook near you.</b><br />
Chromebooks are now the&nbsp;<a href=""https://chrome.googleblog.com/2016/05/the-google-play-store-coming-to.html"">#2 most popular PC operating system in the U.S.</a>, and soon you’ll be able to do even more with them. We’re <a href=""https://chrome.googleblog.com/2016/05/the-google-play-store-coming-to.html"">bringing the Google Play Store to Chromebooks</a>, so you can download and use all your favorite Android apps, right on your Chromebook. <br />
<br />
<b>10. It was full of festival fun.</b><br />
Bringing I/O to Shoreline Amphitheatre meant a conference with a festival feel. Interactive experiments let people from around the world send paper planes and splashes of virtual paint zooming onto the keynote stage. That night, Charli XCX and Kygo performed for a crowd lit up with glow sticks. And at After Hours, acrobats mingled alongside a karaoke rickshaw, DJs spun from the tops of art cars, and domes that held tech talks during the day were converted into underwater discos and a planetarium. <br />

5028430669502018663,,Google Blogs,2016-05-18T11:00:00-07:00,I/O: Building the next evolution of Google,"This morning in our Mountain View, CA backyard, we kicked off Google I/O, our annual developer conference. Much has changed since our first developer event 10 years ago, and even more since Google started 17 years ago. Back then, there were 300 million people online, connecting through desktop machines; today that number is over 3 billion, with the majority using mobile devices as their primary way to get information, organize their day, get from point A to point B, and stay in touch. In a world in which the mobile phone has become the remote control for our daily lives, Google’s mission “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful” is truer and more important than ever before. <br />
<br />
<b>The Google assistant</b><br />
When we think of the Google search experience today—a rich panel of information on [Zika virus], or an alert telling you your flight is delayed—it’s striking to see how far things have come from the early days of 10 blue links. Many of these advances have been thanks to machine learning and artificial intelligence—specifically, areas like natural language processing, voice recognition and translation—and they have helped us build an increasingly useful and assistive experience for users. They are the ingredients that make Google speech recognition the most accurate in the world, and that let you take a picture of a sign in Chinese and see it translated into English. <br />
<br />
Progress in all of these areas is accelerating, and we believe we are at a seminal moment. People are increasingly interacting naturally with Google, and aren’t just looking for the world’s information but actually expecting Google to help them with their daily tasks.  <br />
<br />
Which is why we’re pleased to introduce...the Google assistant.<br />
<br />
The assistant is conversational—an ongoing two-way dialogue between you and Google that understands your world and helps you get things done. It makes it easy to buy movie tickets while on the go, to find that perfect restaurant for your family to grab a quick bite before the movie starts, and then help you navigate to the theater. It’s a Google for you, by you.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3UuL0Dlv9RQ/Vzx1HvHCTEI/AAAAAAAASUQ/uZfManQSGX8VWNn8Jw-P_8FDV3L0UU46QCLcB/s1600/OPA_Social_v04_JRS_2016-05-17.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""320"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3UuL0Dlv9RQ/Vzx1HvHCTEI/AAAAAAAASUQ/uZfManQSGX8VWNn8Jw-P_8FDV3L0UU46QCLcB/s640/OPA_Social_v04_JRS_2016-05-17.gif"" width=""640"" /></a></div>The assistant is an ambient experience that will work seamlessly across devices and contexts. So you can summon Google’s help no matter where you are or what the context. It builds on all our years of investment in deeply understanding users' questions.<br />
<br />
Today we gave a preview of two new products where you’ll soon be able to draw on the Google assistant.  <br />
<br />
<b>Google Home</b><br />
Google Home is a voice-activated product that brings the Google assistant to any room in your house. It lets you enjoy entertainment, manage everyday tasks, and get answers from Google—all using conversational speech. With a simple voice command, you can ask Google Home to play a song, set a timer for the oven, check your flight, or turn on your lights. It’s designed to fit your home with customizable bases in different colors and materials. Google Home will be released later this year. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nilr6F7t1AU/Vzx1LP1d1SI/AAAAAAAASUc/rkjvgsCCl3kH3k331gHAWxMC05MZWxNiwCLcB/s1600/GH_Livingroom.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""458"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nilr6F7t1AU/Vzx1LP1d1SI/AAAAAAAASUc/rkjvgsCCl3kH3k331gHAWxMC05MZWxNiwCLcB/s640/GH_Livingroom.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></div><b>Allo and Duo</b><br />
Allo is a new messaging app that also comes complete with the Google assistant, so you can interact with it directly in your chats, either one-on-one or with friends. Because the assistant understands your world, you can ask for things like your agenda for the day or photos from your last trip. If you’re planning a dinner with friends, you can ask the assistant to suggest restaurants nearby, all in one thread. <br />

There’s also an Incognito mode that provides end-to-end encryption, discreet notifications, and message expiration.<br />
<br />
In addition to Allo, we’re introducing Duo, a companion app for one-to-one video calling. With Duo, our goal is to make video calling faster and more reliable, even on slower network speeds. We also introduced a feature called Knock Knock, which gives you a live video of the other caller before you answer. <br />
<br />
Best of all, both Allo and Duo are based on your phone number, so you can communicate with anyone regardless of whether they’re on Android or iOS. Both apps will be available this summer.

</b> <b>Tackling global challenges with smarter tools </b><br />
Machine learning and AI are changing not only computing, but also the way in which we tackle problems we’ve never been able to solve before. The opportunities are even greater when we harness the powers of <a href=""http://tensorflow.org/"">open-source tools</a> to make them available to the broader developer and researcher community. Imagine what we could do if we work together and use these technologies to tackle challenges in climate change, health care or education. As our machine learning and AI capabilities get smarter and more versatile, these possibilities are starting to appear on the horizon. These are very exciting times indeed.<br />

3575178364144787818,,Google Blogs,2016-05-18T10:54:00-07:00,Saying 👋 to Allo and Duo: new apps for smart messaging and video calling ,"Whether it’s welcoming a new baby, celebrating the winning shot in overtime, or discovering the best taco stand ever—we all want to share these moments with friends and family the instant they happen. Most of the time, this means picking up our phones and sending a message or starting a call. Today we’re sharing a preview of two new apps that take a fresh look at how people connect. <br />
<b><br />
</b> <b>Allo, a smart messaging app</b><br />
Allo is a smart messaging app that makes your conversations easier and more expressive. It’s based on your phone number, so you can get in touch with anyone in your phonebook. And with deeply integrated machine learning, Allo has smart features to keep your conversations flowing and help you get things done.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vq9CkOc8UnE/Vzx3gVOFk8I/AAAAAAAASUw/nQgWUgsLBKoz2aDDEMWKUJ8KJKiM266PQCLcB/s1600/1-Expressiveness_animation_v4-GIF_abbrev.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""640"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vq9CkOc8UnE/Vzx3gVOFk8I/AAAAAAAASUw/nQgWUgsLBKoz2aDDEMWKUJ8KJKiM266PQCLcB/s640/1-Expressiveness_animation_v4-GIF_abbrev.gif"" width=""314"" /></a></div><i>Emojis, stickers, Ink, and our Whisper Shout feature in Allo</i><br />
<br />
Allo has Smart Reply built in (similar to <a href=""https://gmail.googleblog.com/2015/11/computer-respond-to-this-email.html"">Inbox</a>), so you can respond to messages without typing a single word. Smart Reply learns over time and will show suggestions that are in your style. For example, it will learn whether you’re more of a “haha” vs. “lol” kind of person. The more you use Allo the more “you” the suggestions will become. Smart Reply also works with photos, providing intelligent suggestions related to the content of the photo. If your friend sends you a photo of tacos, for example, you may see Smart Reply suggestions like “yummy” or “I love tacos.”<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yZ11M5aHNfQ/Vzx3gXewCgI/AAAAAAAASUs/j3cX6seCApg0rfi3VElf503zGeKbfk_zACLcB/s1600/2-Smart-Replies_animation_v6-GIF_abbrev.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""640"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yZ11M5aHNfQ/Vzx3gXewCgI/AAAAAAAASUs/j3cX6seCApg0rfi3VElf503zGeKbfk_zACLcB/s640/2-Smart-Replies_animation_v6-GIF_abbrev.gif"" width=""313"" /></a></div><i>Smart Reply suggestions in Allo</i><br />
<br />
Allo also features the Google assistant, bringing the richness of Google directly into your chats—helping you find information, get things done, and have fun. You can chat one-on-one with the assistant, or call on Google in a group chat with friends. Either way, you no longer have to jump between apps to do things like book a dinner reservation with friends, get up-to-date sports scores, settle a bet, or play a game. The assistant in Allo lets you bring things like Search, Maps, YouTube and Translate to all your conversations, so that you and your friends can use Google together. <br />
<br />
The Google assistant in Allo understands your world, so you can ask for things like your agenda for the day, details of your flight and hotel, or photos from your last trip. And since it understands natural language patterns, you can just chat like yourself and it’ll understand what you’re saying. For example, ""Is my flight delayed?"" will return information about your flight status.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ROYrLax6ggg/Vzx3fKq_mjI/AAAAAAAASUo/M5hptuwxzqYuhcyB1jcYcbwSA0nHiiN0wCLcB/s1600/3-Gbot_animation_v4-GIF_abbrev%2B%25281%2529.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""640"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ROYrLax6ggg/Vzx3fKq_mjI/AAAAAAAASUo/M5hptuwxzqYuhcyB1jcYcbwSA0nHiiN0wCLcB/s640/3-Gbot_animation_v4-GIF_abbrev%2B%25281%2529.gif"" width=""314"" /></a></div><i>Google assistant in Allo</i><br />
<br />
Privacy and security are important in messaging, so following in the footsteps of Chrome, we created Incognito mode in Allo. Chats in Incognito mode will have end-to-end encryption and discreet notifications, and we’ll continue to add new features to this mode. <br />
<br />
<b>Duo, a video calling app for everyone</b><br />
Duo is a simple, fast one-to-one video calling app for everyone—whether you’re on Android or iOS, a fast or slow connection, in New York or New Delhi. Like Allo, Duo is based on your phone number, allowing you to reach anyone in your phonebook. And its simple interface fades away when you’re in a call, so it’s just the two of you.<br />
<a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iAtJJsbnTng/Vzx4hDSuXHI/AAAAAAAASU4/1_y7oZf4ntoJsqoRLOdWFCvKLZIX4MqUQCLcB/s1600/social-2.png"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iAtJJsbnTng/Vzx4hDSuXHI/AAAAAAAASU4/1_y7oZf4ntoJsqoRLOdWFCvKLZIX4MqUQCLcB/s640/social-2.png"" width=""640"" /></a><br />
<div><i>Video call in Duo</i></div><br />
One of our favorite features of Duo is Knock Knock, which shows you a live video preview of the caller before you pick up. Knock Knock invites you into the moment, making calls feel spontaneous and fun. Once you answer, Duo seamlessly transitions you right into the call. <br />
<br />
Duo calls are in crisp HD video (up to 720p) and audio. We’ve optimized Duo to work well even on spotty networks, so if bandwidth is limited it gracefully adjusts quality so you’re still able to connect. We also seamlessly transition calls between cellular and Wi-Fi, so you don’t need to worry about what network you’re on. Finally, we built Duo with privacy and security in mind and all calls on Duo are end-to-end encrypted.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/CIeMysX76pM"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
Both apps will be available this summer on Android and iOS. Head over to Google Play and register to be notified when&nbsp;<a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fireball"">Allo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tachyon"">Duo</a>&nbsp;are available. We can't wait for you to try them.<br />

8749921427049996564,,Google Blogs,2016-05-17T06:00:00-07:00,"An eye for detail: Zoom through 1,000 artworks thanks to the new Art Camera from the Google Cultural Institute ","So much of the beauty and power of art lives in the details. You can only fully appreciate the genius of artists like Monet or Van Gogh when you stand so close to a masterpiece that your nose almost touches it. As you step back from the brush strokes, you wonder how it all comes together. At the Google Cultural Institute, we know that people love experiencing art in close detail. Millions of people spend time exploring our ultra-high resolution “gigapixel” images, inch by inch—spotting something new every time, like a <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/the-gods-of-the-olympus/XwFDbQC5UuACCA?ms=%7B%22x%22%3A0.6067738638398309%2C%22y%22%3A0.644676407394092%2C%22z%22%3A12.079563859553183%2C%22size%22%3A%7B%22width%22%3A0.08003103489631716%2C%22height%22%3A0.22248817032094279%7D%7D"">hidden signature</a> or the <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/the-port-of-rotterdam/XAFcyRe5y7Mo7Q?ms=%7B%22x%22%3A0.6440979063197267%2C%22y%22%3A0.7190202766766446%2C%22z%22%3A13.530874811694657%2C%22size%22%3A%7B%22width%22%3A0.028144807397305734%2C%22height%22%3A0.05763905975744561%7D%7D"">individual dabs of paint</a> that give the impression of shimmering, turbulent waters. <br />
<br />
Zooming into these images is the closest thing to walking up to the real thing with a magnifying glass. This is why we’re so excited about our new Art Camera—a custom-built camera ready to travel around the world to bring people more of these ultra-high-resolution images than ever possible before. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HZXoLojEa6M/VzsTzdAJyYI/AAAAAAAASTc/adx81q44QhQUdfqGJvehonczOxo2k26pACLcB/s1600/port%2Bof%2Brotterdam.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""492"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HZXoLojEa6M/VzsTzdAJyYI/AAAAAAAASTc/adx81q44QhQUdfqGJvehonczOxo2k26pACLcB/s640/port%2Bof%2Brotterdam.gif"" width=""640"" /></a></div><i><a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/the-port-of-rotterdam/XAFcyRe5y7Mo7Q?projectId=art-camera"">The Port of Rotterdam by Paul Signac, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen</a> </i><br />
<br />
A gigapixel image is made of over one billion pixels, and can bring out details invisible to the naked eye.  So creating digital images in such high resolution is a complex technical challenge. You need time, highly specialized and expensive equipment, and only a few people in the world can do the job. In the first five years of the Google Cultural Institute, we’ve been able to share about 200 gigapixel images. But we want to do much more. That’s why we developed the Art Camera. <br />
<br />
The Art Camera is a robotic camera, custom-built to create gigapixel images faster and more easily. A robotic system steers the camera automatically from detail to detail, taking hundreds of high resolution close-ups of the painting. To make sure the focus is right on each brush stroke, it’s equipped with a laser and a sonar that—much like a bat—uses high frequency sound to measure the distance of the artwork. Once each detail is captured, our software takes the thousands of close-up shots and, like a jigsaw, stitches the pieces together into one single image.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/dOrJesw5ET8"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
Many of the works of our greatest artists are fragile and sensitive to light and humidity. With the Art Camera, museums can share these priceless works with the global public while ensuring they're preserved for future generations. We want to give museums the tools they need to do this important work, so we're sending a fleet of these cameras from museum to museum around the world—for free. <br />
<br />
The Art Camera will dramatically increase the scale and depth at which museums are able to provide access to our shared cultural heritage to anyone around the world. For example, if you wanted to see Van Gogh’s six famous portraits of the Roulin family up close, you’d need to travel across the Netherlands then over to LA and New York. Now the Art Camera can travel for you. It’s already captured the <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/portrait-of-armand-roulin/3wF7xOZU-dKdrg"">Portrait of Armand Roulin</a>, which you can explore alongside <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/browse/roulin"">the rest of the family</a>, all in one place. <br />
<br />
Today, we’re sharing the first thousand ultra-high resolution images of artworks from artists including <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/apple-harvest/GgEtbnL6cNOmjg?projectId=art-camera"">Pissarro</a>, <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/rotterdam-the-steams/DgEEOeCaNUMUdQ"">Signac</a>, <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/titus-at-his-desk/KwEx0M8TF4uCTg?projectId=art-camera"">Rembrandt</a>, <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/vase-with-red-and-white-flowers/gQGHbLBk4GDk3g?projectId=art-camera"">Van Gogh</a>, <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/champ-de-coquelicots/HQHTJy6eBzNayQ?projectId=art-camera"">Monet</a> and many more from museums across Australia, India, the Netherlands, Brazil and everywhere in between. As we prepare to celebrate <a href=""http://network.icom.museum/international-museum-day"">International Museum Day</a> and welcome more than 25 new museums on the Google Cultural Institute, we want to thank everyone who worked with us to test the new camera in the recent months. Thanks to their work, today you can start zooming and <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/project/art-camera"">explore more art in the details than ever before</a>!  <br />

3424380567815829791,,Google Blogs,2016-05-16T07:40:00-07:00,"Introducing Spaces, a tool for small group sharing","Group sharing isn’t easy. From book clubs to house hunts to weekend trips and more, getting friends into the same app can be challenging. Sharing things typically involves hopping between apps to copy and paste links. Group conversations often don’t stay on topic, and things get lost in endless threads that you can’t easily get back to when you need them.<br />
<br />
We wanted to build a better group sharing experience, so we made a new app called <a href=""http://spaces.google.com/"">Spaces</a> that lets people get people together instantly to share around any topic.<br />
<br />
With Spaces, it’s simple to find and share articles, videos and images without leaving the app, since Google Search, YouTube, and Chrome come built in.<br />

You can create a space with just one tap for any topic and invite anyone via messaging, email, a social network, or whatever way you like.<br />
<br />
We’ll also be experimenting with Spaces this week at Google I/O. We’ve created a space for each session so that developers can connect with each other and Googlers around topics at I/O, and we've got a few surprises too. If you’re joining us in person at I/O, make sure you install Spaces on Android or iOS before you arrive!<br />
<br />
<a href=""http://spaces.google.com/"">Spaces</a> is rolling out today on <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.social.spaces"">Android</a>, <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spaces-small-group-sharing/id1025159334?ls=1&amp;mt=8"">iOS</a>, desktop, and mobile web for all Gmail addresses.

In Mayes County, Oklahoma, digital artist <a href=""https://datacentermurals.withgoogle.com/mayescounty"">Jenny Odell</a>’s mural is made up of Google Maps satellite imagery. Her mural artwork focuses on types of infrastructure that enable the flow of goods, power and information—not unlike data centers themselves.<br />
<br />
Belgium local street artist <a href=""https://datacentermurals.withgoogle.com/stghislain"">Oli-B</a> took inspiration from “the cloud” for his colorful mural on the outside of our St. Ghislain data center. He’s painted clouds that include elements specific to the region, the data center and the people who run it—including the sheep that roam the data center grounds and a balloon from the annual festival L'Ascension à Saint-Ghislain.<br />
<br />
Soon, we’ll add murals at two more data centers, and eventually we hope to bring the project to more locations around the world. Check out photos, videos and more at <a href=""http://g.co/datacentermurals"">g.co/datacentermurals</a>.<br />

Say you’re texting with a friend about tomorrow’s lunch plans. They ask you for the address. Until now it’s worked like this: You leave your texting app. Open Search. Find the restaurant. Copy the address. Switch back to your texts. Paste the address into a message. And finally, hit send. <br />
<br />
Searching and sending stuff on your phone shouldn’t be that difficult. With Gboard, you can search and send all kinds of things—restaurant info, flight times, news articles—right from your keyboard. Anything you’d search on Google, you can search with Gboard. Results appear as cards with the key information front and center, such as the phone number, ratings and hours. With one tap, you can send it to your friend and you keep the conversation going.<br />

<br />
First, say hello to&nbsp;<b>Tap to Translate</b> on Android. We know millions of you painstakingly copy-paste text between Google Translate and other apps. Now, you can just copy the text of a chat, comment, song lyric, etc. in whichever app you’re using, and a translation will pop up right there—no need to switch apps:<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xtEp55MKRE"">Watch the video</a> to learn more. Tap to Translate works for <a href=""https://translate.google.com/about/intl/en_ALL/languages.html"">all 103 of Google Translate’s languages</a> on any Android phone running Jellybean (4.2) and above.<br />
<br />
Next,&nbsp;<b>Offline Mode&nbsp;</b>now works on iOS, and joins Android in using small offline packages. We know that many of you found the previous packages too big to download on unreliable data connections or to keep on your phone’s limited storage. That’s why we shrunk them by 90 percent, to a much more manageable 25 MB each.<br />
<br />
Offline Mode is easy to set up: Just tap the arrow next to the language name to download the package for that language, and then you’ll be ready to do text translations whether you’re online or not—and it works with Tap to Translate too. We’ve just added a Filipino language pack, bringing our <a href=""http://translate.google.com/about/intl/en_ALL/languages/"">total number of offline languages </a>to 52.<br />

1533664757129915367,,Google Blogs,2016-05-07T09:00:00-07:00,Digital #LoveLetters from children of the incarcerated ,"Back in February, <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/02/strengthening-our-commitment-to-racial.htmlhttps://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/02/strengthening-our-commitment-to-racial.html"">we announced</a> a new effort from Google.org focused on racial justice, including support for organizations working to end mass incarceration. This is a critical issue in the United States, <a href=""http://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-sheet"">which represents 5 percent of the world’s population, but 25 percent of the world’s prison population</a>. And <a href=""http://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-sheet"">Blacks are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of whites</a>—in fact, the United States imprisons a larger percentage of its Black population than <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/10/mapping-the-new-jim-crow/381617/"">South Africa did at the height of apartheid</a>. <br />
<br />
An often overlooked fact of mass incarceration is that many first-time, nonviolent offenders who receive prison sentences are parents. There are 2.7 million American children with a parent behind bars, and Black children are 7.5 times more likely to have a parent behind bars than their white counterparts. The experience of having a parent in prison is traumatizing to a child: a new <a href=""http://www.aecf.org/blog/report-recommends-policies-to-help-millions-of-children-with-incarcerated-parents/"">study from the Annie E. Casey Foundation</a> found that the incarceration of a parent can have as much impact on a child’s well-being as abuse or domestic violence. <br />
<br />
So this Mother’s Day and Father’s Day, in an effort to raise awareness of the impact of mass incarceration, we’ve partnered with NGOs on Love Letters: a series of videos that contain children’s messages of love for a mother or father in prison. These digital love letters are demonstrations of the unbreakable love between parent and child, and of the pain of growing up without a parent present.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/OwNYIww709Q"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
The videos reveal a side of mass incarceration that many people don’t get a chance to see. They allow us to bear witness, to be proximate to the very human costs of incarceration. Before I joined Google, I spent years as a human rights lawyer working on criminal justice reform. When I visited women’s prisons, I saw how broken women prisoners were because almost all were mothers to small children. Few received visits from family or children because of how remote women’s prisons usually are. When children did visit, some weren’t allowed to hug or touch their mothers. I also visited detention centers for girls, where many were the daughters of incarcerated mothers. The girls had been trafficked or arrested for running away from group homes or abusive foster placements, and they shared with me the pain of not having a mother there to teach them and protect them. <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1zGSqaZ655s"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
The impact of mass incarceration is generational and devastating. I hope that after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnHDom1MBC4p1ZI6Z4jRfiw"">watching these videos</a>,&nbsp;you’ll choose to learn more about the critical work organizations like <a href=""http://www.osborneny.org/"">The Osborne Association</a>, <a href=""http://hourchildren.org/"">Hour Children</a>, and Google.org grantees <a href=""http://www.essiejusticegroup.org/"">Essie Justice Group</a>, the <a href=""http://ellabakercenter.org/"">Ella Baker Center</a> and the <a href=""http://www.eji.org/"">Equal Justice Initiative</a> are doing to support children affected by incarceration and to advance criminal justice reform. You can also learn more about mass incarceration on <a href=""http://vera.org/"">vera.org</a> and contribute to the conversation with #LoveLetters on social media.<br />

1324039896802740256,,Google Blogs,2016-05-03T03:00:00-07:00,"Helping for the long term in Flint, Michigan","Access to clean drinking water is a concern all over the world, but in the United States it’s often a foregone conclusion. That is not the case recently for the residents of Flint, Michigan, many of whom we now know have been exposed to lead in their tap water. It’s a crisis, one to which the American people readily responded by donating water and resources to help alleviate the immediate pain. But the problem won’t go away quickly, and understanding its extent is both challenging and an absolute necessity. Today, Google.org is providing $250,000 to partners in the Flint community to help, with a special focus on a technical solution for understanding and resolving the crisis for the long term.<br />
<br />
First, we’re making a <b>$150,000 grant to the University of Michigan-Flint</b> to enable the University of Michigan-Flint to develop a comprehensive data platform that will assist government and community leaders in making more informed decisions about the crisis and providing critical information to citizens. The funds will support student researchers at the University of Michigan, Flint and Ann Arbor campuses, to do this work under the leadership of Professors Mark Allison (Flint) and Jake Abernathy (Ann Arbor) to answer key questions about the crisis and response, such as the probability of lead levels before they are tested. The team plans to develop a platform and app that visualizes the data and also provides the ability for citizens to seek out and request key services, such as reporting concerns about water and requesting testing kits. Google volunteers will provide guidance and mentoring on the technology and product design. <br />
<br />
We’re also making a <b>$100,000 donation to the Community Foundation of Greater Flint for the Flint Child Health &amp; Development Fund</b>. The <a href=""https://www.cfgf.org/cfgf/GoodWork/FlintArea/WaterCrisis/tabid/855/Default.aspx"">Flint Child Health &amp; Development Fund</a> was founded to ensure the long-term health of Flint families, especially newborns to children 6 years old—the group most vulnerable to developmental issues from lead. The Fund is a supplemental resource to state and federal funding and gives grants for childcare-related initiatives such as early childhood education, student support services, continuous access to a pediatric medical home, access to infant and child behavioral health services, and research. <br />
<br />
With Google offices in Ann Arbor and Birmingham, Flint and its residents are also our neighbors. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, a group of 20 Google volunteers went to Flint and volunteered at the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan, where they helped with distributing bottled water and food in the greater Flint area. Around $35,000 has been donated through employees and Google's gift match program to the <a href=""https://give.corp.google.com/org/54161"">United Way of Genesee County</a> and the <a href=""https://give.corp.google.com/org/56657"">Flint Water Fund</a> to aid in the crisis, and our employee groups, like the Black Googler Network, continue to explore more ways to help.<br />
<br />
As a native Michigander, I'm proud that we can help our neighbors in Flint. We hope we can support a resolution to this crisis and assist the residents of Flint in getting the resources they need and deserve, both for the short and long term.<br />

<i>Every year, Larry and Sergey write a Founders' Letter to our stockholders updating them with some of our recent highlights and sharing our vision for the future. This year, they decided to try something new. - Ed.</i></div>
<br />
<i>In August, I announced Alphabet and our new structure and shared my thoughts on how we were thinking about the future of our business. (It is reprinted <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html"">here</a> in case you missed it, as it seems to apply just as much today.) I’m really pleased with how Alphabet is going. I am also very pleased with Sundar’s performance as our new Google CEO. Since the majority of our big bets are in Google, I wanted to give him most of the bully-pulpit here to reflect on Google’s accomplishments and share his vision. In the future, you should expect that Sundar, Sergey and I will use this space to give you a good personal overview of where we are and where we are going.&nbsp;</i><br />
<i><br />
</i> <i>- Larry Page, CEO, Alphabet</i><br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
When Larry and Sergey founded Google in 1998, there were about 300 million people online. By and large, they were sitting in a chair, logging on to a desktop machine, typing searches on a big keyboard connected to a big, bulky monitor. Today, that number is around 3 billion people, many of them searching for information on tiny devices they carry with them wherever they go.<br />
<br />
In many ways, the founding mission of Google back in ’98—“to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”—is even truer and more important to tackle today, in a world where people look to their devices to help organize their day, get them from one place to another, and keep in touch. The mobile phone really has become the remote control for our daily lives, and we’re communicating, consuming, educating, and entertaining ourselves, on our phones, in ways unimaginable just a few years ago. <br />
<br />
<b>Knowledge for everyone: search and assistance</b><br />
As we said when we announced Alphabet, “the new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google.” Those opportunities live within our mission, and today we are about one thing above all else: making information and knowledge available for everyone.<br />
<br />
This of course brings us to Search—the very core of this company. It’s easy to take Search for granted after so many years, but it’s amazing to think just how far it has come and still has to go. I still remember the days when 10 bare blue links on a desktop page helped you navigate to different parts of the Internet. Contrast that to today, where the majority of our searches come from mobile, and an increasing number of them via voice. These queries get harder and harder with each passing year—people want more local, more context-specific information, and they want it at their fingertips. So we’ve made it possible for you to search for [Leonardo DiCaprio movies] or [Zika virus] and get a rich panel of facts and visuals. You can also get answers via Google Now—like the weather in your upcoming vacation spot, or when you should leave for the airport—without you even needing to ask the question. <br />
<br />
Helping you find information that gets you through your day extends well beyond the classic search query. Think, for example, of the number of photos you and your family have taken throughout your life, all of your memories. Collectively, people will take 1 trillion photos this year with their devices. So we launched Google Photos to make it easier for people to organize their photos and videos, keep them safe, and be able to find them when they want to, on whatever device they are using. Photos launched less than a year ago and already has more than 100 million monthly active users. Or take Google Maps. When you ask us about a location, you don’t just want to know how to get from point A to point B. Depending on the context, you may want to know what time is best to avoid the crowds, whether the store you’re looking for is open right now, or what the best things to do are in a destination you’re visiting for the first time.<br />
<br />
But all of this is just a start. There is still much work to be done to make Search and our Google services more helpful to you throughout your day. You should be able to move seamlessly across Google services in a natural way, and get assistance that understands your context, situation, and needs—all while respecting your privacy and protecting your data. The average parent has different needs than the average college student. Similarly, a user wants different help when in the car versus the living room. Smart assistance should understand all of these things and be helpful at the right time, in the right way.<br />
<br />
<b>The power of machine learning and artificial intelligence</b><br />
A key driver behind all of this work has been our long-term investment in machine learning and AI. It’s what allows you to use your voice to search for information, to translate the web from one language to another, to filter the spam from your inbox, to search for “hugs” in your photos and actually pull up pictures of people hugging ... to solve many of the problems we encounter in daily life. It’s what has allowed us to build products that get better over time, making them increasingly useful and helpful.<br />
<br />
We’ve been building the best AI team and tools for years, and recent breakthroughs will allow us<br />
to do even more. This past March, DeepMind’s AlphaGo took on Lee Sedol, a legendary Go master, becoming the first program to beat a professional at the most complex game mankind ever devised. The implications for this victory are, literally, game changing—and the ultimate winner is humanity. This is another important step toward creating artificial intelligence that can help us in everything from accomplishing our daily tasks and travels, to eventually tackling even bigger challenges like climate change and cancer diagnosis.<br />
<br />
<b>More great content, in more places</b><br />
In the early days of the Internet, people thought of information primarily in terms of web pages. Our focus on our core mission has led us to many efforts over the years to improve discovery, creation, and monetization of content—from indexing images, video, and the news, to building platforms like Google Play and YouTube. And with the migration to mobile, people are watching more videos, playing more games, listening to more music, reading more books, and using more apps than ever before.<br />
<br />
That’s why we have worked hard to make YouTube and Google Play useful platforms for discovering and delivering great content from creators and developers to our users, when they want it, on whatever screen is in front of them. Google Play reaches more than 1 billion Android users. And YouTube is the number-one destination for video—over 1 billion users per month visit the site—and ranks among the year’s most downloaded mobile apps. In fact, the amount of time people spend watching videos on YouTube continues to grow rapidly—and more than half of this watchtime now happens on mobile. As we look to the future, we aim to provide more choice to YouTube fans—more ways for them to engage with creators and each other, and more ways for them to get great content. We’ve started down this journey with specialized apps like YouTube Kids, as well as through our YouTube Red subscription service, which allows fans to get all of YouTube without ads, a premium YouTube Music experience and exclusive access to new original series and movies from top YouTube creators like PewDiePie and Lilly Singh.<br />
<br />
We also continue to invest in the mobile web—which is a vital source of traffic for the vast majority of websites. Over this past year, Google has worked closely with publishers, developers, and others in the ecosystem to help make the mobile web a smoother, faster experience for users. A good example is the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project, which we launched as an open-source initiative in partnership with news publishers, to help them create mobile-optimized content that loads instantly everywhere. The other example is Progressive Web Apps (PWA), which combine the best of the web and the best of apps—allowing companies to build mobile sites that load quickly, send push notifications, have home screen icons, and much more. And finally, we continue to invest in improving Chrome on mobile—in the four short years since launch, it has just passed 1 billion monthly active users on mobile.<br />
<br />
Of course, great content requires investment. Whether you’re talking about Google’s web search, or a compelling news article you read in The New York Times or The Guardian, or watching a video on YouTube, advertising helps fund content for millions and millions of people. So we work hard to build great ad products that people find useful—and that give revenue back to creators and publishers.<br />
<br />
<b>Powerful computing platforms</b><br />
Just a decade ago, computing was still synonymous with big computers that sat on our desks. Then, over just a few years, the keys to powerful computing—processors and sensors—became so small and cheap that they allowed for the proliferation of supercomputers that fit into our pockets: mobile phones. Android has helped drive this scale: it has more than 1.4 billion 30-day-active devices—and growing. <br />
<br />
Today’s proliferation of “screens” goes well beyond phones, desktops, and tablets. Already, there are exciting developments as screens extend to your car, like Android Auto, or your wrist, like Android Wear. Virtual reality is also showing incredible promise—Google Cardboard has introduced more than 5 million people to the incredible, immersive and educational possibilities of VR.<br />
<br />
Looking to the future, the next big step will be for the very concept of the “device” to fade away. Over time, the computer itself—whatever its form factor—will be an intelligent assistant helping you through your day. We will move from mobile first to an AI first world.<br />
<br />
<b>Enterprise</b><br />
Most of these computing experiences are very likely to be built in the cloud. The cloud is more secure, more cost effective, and it provides the ability to easily take advantage of the latest technology advances, be it more automated operations, machine learning, or more intelligent office productivity tools.<br />
<br />
Google started in the cloud and has been investing in infrastructure, data management, analytics, and AI from the very beginning. We now have a broad and growing set of enterprise offerings: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Google Apps, Chromebooks, Android, image recognition, speech translation, maps, machine learning for customers’ proprietary data sets, and more. Our customers like Whirlpool, Land O’Lakes and Spotify are transforming their businesses by using our enterprise productivity suite of Google Apps and Google Cloud Platform services.<br />
<br />
As we look to our long-term investments in our productivity tools supported by our machine learning and artificial intelligence efforts, we see huge opportunities to dramatically improve how people work. Your phone should proactively bring up the right documents, schedule and map your meetings, let people know if you are late, suggest responses to messages, handle your payments and expenses, etc.<br />
<br />
<b>Building for everyone</b><br />
Whether it’s a developer using Google Cloud Platform to power their new application, or a creator finding new income and viewers via YouTube, we believe in leveling the playing field for everyone. The Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers, and we see it as our job to make it available to as many people as possible.<br />
<br />
This belief has been a core Google principle from the very start—remember that Google Search was in the hands of millions long before the idea for Google advertising was born. We work on advertising because it’s what allows us to make our services free; Google Search works the same for anyone with an Internet connection, whether it is in a modern high-rise or a rural schoolhouse.<br />
<br />
Making this possible is a lot more complicated than simply translating a product or launching a local country domain. Poor infrastructure keeps billions of people around the world locked out of all of the possibilities the web may offer them. That’s why we make it possible for there to be a $50 Android phone, or a $100 Chromebook. It’s why this year we launched Maps with turn-by-turn navigation that works even without an Internet connection, and made it possible for people to get faster-loading, streamlined Google Search if they are on a slower network. We want to make sure that no matter who you are or where you are or how advanced the device you are using ... Google works for you.<br />
<br />
In all we do, Google will continue to strive to make sure that remains true—to build technology <u>for everyone</u>. Farmers in Kenya use Google Search to keep up with crop prices and make sure they can make a good living. A classroom in Wisconsin can take a field trip to the Sistine Chapel ... just by holding a pair of Cardboard goggles. People everywhere can use their voices to share new perspectives, and connect with others, by creating and watching videos on YouTube. Information can be shared—knowledge can flow—from anyone, to anywhere. In 17 years, it’s remarkable to me the degree to which the company has stayed true to our original vision for what Google should do, and what we should become.<br />
<br />
For us, technology is not about the devices or the products we build. Those aren’t the end-goals. Technology is a democratizing force, empowering people through information. Google is an information company. It was when it was founded, and it is today. And it’s what people do with that information that amazes and inspires me every day.<br />

She is also CEO of the Starfish Foundation, which provides financial assistance and mentoring to help kids go to college.

<br />
Kids dream about what they want to be when they grow up, but these dreams are often limited—built around the few professional people they know. What if children don’t know a veterinarian, an airplane pilot, a paleontologist, or someone in dozens of other careers? What if they lack access to internships or mentors? Can they ever dream big?<br />
<br />
I know from watching my own kids visit me at work, and from the scholars I mentor, that exposure to all kinds of professionals is the key to inspiring young people. When I first found out about Expeditions, I saw its potential for broadening the horizons of the student scholars we help at Starfish Foundation. I envisioned creating virtual reality Expeditions that let kids step into someone’s work day, simply by using phones and Google Cardboard viewers. So that’s what we did.<br />

</tbody></table>Working with the <a href=""https://www.google.com/edu/expeditions/"" target=""_blank"">Google Expeditions</a> team, we created virtual reality tours that show kids the ins and out of careers they might not ever learn about otherwise. From flying an airplane to testing fossil samples, kids can see with their own eyes exactly what people do in many different scenarios. They can watch Carolyn Brown, director of surgery for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, perform a procedure on a cat. Or join Mark Norell, a paleontology professor with the American Museum of Natural History, as he examines a velociraptor specimen up close. And today, schools participating in the <a href=""http://www.google.com/edu/expeditions"" target=""_blank"">Google Expeditions Pioneer Program</a> and <a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/1p0dtgldB1OeF7b9PjOesJei-IGdFahCoI_d5c2CL6ZU/viewform"" target=""_blank"">Expeditions beta</a> will be able to go on an Expedition of the Google Mountain View campus to see what it’s like to work at Google.<br />

</tbody></table>These Expeditions reveal what professionals like about their jobs, what they studied in school, and how they apply their knowledge to their work. Regular field trips are logistically challenging, and they don’t usually focus on careers. But with Expeditions, teachers can share an experience with students right in the classroom. You can’t fit 30 students in the cockpit of a plane, but you can get a virtual reality tour of one using Expeditions. And today, on “Take Your Kids to Work Day,” there’s no better time to get creative about exposing students to different types of jobs and workplace environments.<br />
<br />
Children won’t know what jobs are possible if they don’t know the careers exist. Rather than just telling them, teachers can actually show them. With these career Expeditions, students can travel outside the classroom walls and be exposed to more ideas, places and opportunities than ever before. <br />

8648265465644885541,,Google Blogs,2016-04-28T06:00:00-07:00,Ten years of Google Translate,"Ten years ago, we launched Google Translate. Our goal was to break language barriers and to make the world more accessible. Since then we’ve grown from supporting two languages to 103, and from hundreds of users to hundreds of millions. And just like anyone’s first 10 years, we’ve learned to <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/01/hallo-hola-ola-more-powerful-translate.html"">see and understand</a>, <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/introducing-google-translate-app-for.html"">talk</a>, <a href=""http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2010/12/listen-to-us-now.html"">listen</a>, <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/new-look-for-google-translate-for.html"">have a conversation</a>, <a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/04/statistical-machine-translation-live.html"">write</a>, and <a href=""http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2014/07/translate-community-help-us-improve.html"">lean on friends for help</a>. <br />
<br />
But what we're most inspired by is how Google Translate connects people in communities around the world, in ways we never could have imagined—like <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tomatoes-google-kelowna-curtis-stone-1.3532564"">two farmers with a shared passion for tomato farming</a>, a <a href=""http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/143224771746/i-had-cancer-when-i-was-fourteen-and-went-through"">couple discovering they're pregnant in a foreign country</a>, and a <a href=""http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2015/10/futbol-translated.html"">young immigrant on his way to soccer stardom</a>. <br />
<br />
Here’s a look at Google Translate today, 10 years in:<br />
<br />
<b>1. Google Translate helps people make connections.</b><br />
Translate can help people help each other, often in the most difficult of times. Recently we visited a community in Canada that is using Translate to break down barriers and make a refugee family feel more welcome:<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL590L5WQmH8duxGC2KkpCrehZRguas-rC"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
<b>2. There are more than 500 million of you using Google Translate.</b><br />
The most common translations are between English and Spanish, Arabic, Russian, Portuguese and Indonesian. <br />
<br />
<b>3. Together we translate more than 100 billion words a day.</b><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/wIK0JKTQcI8"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
<b>4. Translations reflect trends and events.</b><br />
In addition to common phrases like “I love you,” we also see people looking for translations related to current events and trends. For instance, last year we saw a big spike in translations for the word ""selfie,” and this past week, translations for ""<a href=""https://translate.google.com/#auto/es/purple%20rain"">purple rain</a>"" spiked by more than 25,000 percent.<br />
<br />
<b>5. You’re helping to make Google Translate better with Translate Community.</b><br />
So far, 3.5 million people have made 90 million contributions through <a href=""https://translate.google.com/community?utm_source=about&amp;utm_medium=button&amp;utm_campaign=help_translate"">Translate Community</a>, helping us improve and add new languages to Google Translate. A few properly translated sentences can make a huge difference when faced with a foreign language or country. By reviewing, validating and recommending translations, we’re able to improve the Google Translate on a daily basis. <br />
<br />
<b>6. Brazil uses Google Translate more than any other country.</b><br />
Ninety-two percent of our translations come from outside of the United States, with Brazil topping the list. <br />

You can have a conversation no matter what language you speak.</b><br />
In 2011, we first introduced the ability to have a <a href=""https://support.google.com/translate/answer/6142474?hl=en"">bilingual conversation</a> on Google Translate. The app will recognize which language is being spoken when you’re talking with someone, allowing you to have a natural conversation in <a href=""http://translate.google.com/about/intl/en_ALL/languages/"">32 languages</a>. <br />
<br />
<b>9. You don't need an Internet connection to connect.</b><br />
Many countries don’t have reliable Internet, so it’s important to be able to translate on the go. You can instantly translate signs and menus <a href=""https://support.google.com/translate/answer/6142483#languages_available"">offline with Word Lens</a> on both Android and iOS, and translate typed text offline with <a href=""https://support.google.com/translate/answer/6142473?hl=en"">Android</a>. <br />

There's always more to translate.</b><br />
We’re excited and proud of what we’ve accomplished together over the last 10 years—but there’s lots more to do to break language barriers and help people communicate no matter where they’re from or what language they speak. Thank you for using Google Translate—here’s to another 10!<br />

We’re also offering free calls via Hangouts, Hangouts Dialer or Google Voice to and within Ecuador to help people communicate with loved ones.<br />
<br />
<b>Learn more on the ground</b><br />
For people in and around the affected areas, we have Google Now cards with critical crisis-related information like missing person resources, safety zones, and aftershock safety tips. We’ve made the same information available on search for earthquake-related searches. In Japan, we launched a <a href=""https://www.google.org/crisisresponse/japan"">landing page</a> and <a href=""http://google.org/crisismap/japan"">crisis map</a> showing accessible roads and places where people can get disaster resources like fresh water. In Ecuador, we updated Waze with more than 90 safe place locations, including local shelter information. <br />
<br />
<b>Support for the response </b><br />
Given the scope of the damage and need in Ecuador, Google.org has committed $250,000 to support relief efforts on the ground. We’re also providing up to $250,000 in Google employee gift-matching for both Japan and Ecuador.<br />

In honor of Earth Day this month, we’ve gathered together some of the ways Google can help you reduce your everyday emissions and learn more about preserving our world. <br />

<b>Monitoring forests and wildlife</b><br />
Google Earth satellite technology gives scientists and environmentalists a way to measure and visualize changes of the world on both land and water.

<b>Going solar</b><br />
Looking to generate clean energy savings with solar power on your home? Check out <a href=""https://www.google.com/get/sunroof"">Project Sunroof</a>, a solar calculator that estimates the impact and potential savings of installing solar on the roof of your home. Taking Google Earth imagery and overlaying annual sun exposure and weather patterns, Sunroof is able to assess viable roof space for solar panel installation, estimate the value of solar and savings based on local energy costs, and connect you with providers of solar panels in your area. <br />
<br />
As of this week, Sunroof expanded to 42 states across the U.S. (from <a href=""http://googlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2015/12/should-you-go-solar-just-ask-project.html"">10 states in December</a>), which makes imagery and data available for a solar analysis to 43 million rooftops. We’re also working with organizations like Sierra Club and their <a href=""http://www.sierraclub.org/ready-for-100"">Ready for 100 campaign</a> to help analyze the solar potential of cities across the U.S.<br />

<b>Measuring air pollutants</b><br />
For the past few years, <a href=""http://www.google.com/earth/outreach/index.html"">Google Earth Outreach</a> and the <a href=""https://www.edf.org/climate/methanemaps"">Environmental Defense Fund</a> (EDF) have been working together to map methane leaks from natural gas pipelines under our streets. Since methane is a very potent greenhouse gas (GHG), even small leaks can add up to big emissions that can hurt our climate. By attaching methane analyzers to select Street View cars, we’ve driven more than 7,500 miles and have <a href=""https://www.edf.org/climate/methanemaps"">mapped 4,200+ leaks in 10 cities</a>. What we found ranges from an average of one leak per mile (in Boston) to one leak every 200 miles (in Indianapolis), demonstrating the effectiveness of techniques like using plastic piping instead of steel for pipeline construction. We hope utilities can use this data to prioritize the replacement of gas mains and service lines (like New Jersey’s <a href=""https://www.pseg.com/info/media/newsreleases/2015/2015-11-16.jsp#.Vw7Y15MrKqD"">PSE&amp;G announced</a> last fall). We’re also partnering with <a href=""https://aclima.io/"">Aclima</a> to measure <a href=""http://googlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2015/09/making-invisible-visible-by-mapping-air.html"">many more pollutants</a> with Street View cars in California communities through this year.<br />

4502375703510275572,,Google Blogs,2016-04-12T21:00:00-07:00,Find time for your goals with Google Calendar,"Whether it’s reading more books, learning a new language or working out regularly, achieving your goals can be really hard. One day it's ""I got called into a last-minute meeting."" The next day it's ""I have a friend in town."" And before you know it, your goals are delayed or forgotten. In fact, with all the things you need to do in a given week, it’s probably harder than ever to find the time—even when your goal really matters to you.<br />
<br />
That’s why starting today, we’re introducing Goals in Google Calendar. Just add a personal goal—like “run 3 times a week”—and Calendar will help you find the time and stick to it.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnZZInDyrZo"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
<b>Goals are easy to set up</b><br />
To set a goal (like “Work out more”), simply answer a few questions (like “How often?” and “Best time?”), and you’re all set. From there Calendar will look at your schedule and find the best windows to pencil in time for that goal.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2fQfq-r3kXA/Vw2Hx2FQ_RI/AAAAAAAASKM/C--w0IQjWPYeHL8PukzLvaM40tH0j6R2ACLcB/s1600/Goals%2Bcreate_FINAL.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2fQfq-r3kXA/Vw2Hx2FQ_RI/AAAAAAAASKM/C--w0IQjWPYeHL8PukzLvaM40tH0j6R2ACLcB/s1600/Goals%2Bcreate_FINAL.gif"" /></a></div><b>Goals adjust to your busy life</b><br />
Goals aren't easy—especially when the unexpected comes up—but Calendar can help you adjust in a number of important ways. For example, Calendar will automatically reschedule if you add another event that's a direct conflict with a goal.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SAy_c9rQhY0/Vw2HyR4qK8I/AAAAAAAASKU/3b2ANsNGFQ8d1HB5_e1DEUzZ93-knfojwCLcB/s1600/Goals%2Breschedule_FINAL.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SAy_c9rQhY0/Vw2HyR4qK8I/AAAAAAAASKU/3b2ANsNGFQ8d1HB5_e1DEUzZ93-knfojwCLcB/s1600/Goals%2Breschedule_FINAL.gif"" /></a></div>You can also defer a goal at any time, and Calendar will make time for it later.<br />

1200364947128547993,,Google Blogs,2016-04-12T00:01:00-07:00,Creating a world that works for everyone with Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities ,"More than a billion people have a disability. And regardless of the country or community they live in, the gaps in opportunity for people with disabilities are striking: One in three people with a disability lives in poverty. In places like the United States, 50 to 70 percent of people with disabilities are unemployed; in developing countries that number increases to 80 to 90 percent. And only 10 percent of people with disabilities in developing countries have access to the assistive devices they need. <br />
<br />
Last spring, Google.org <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/google-impact-challenge-disabilities.html"">kicked off the Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities</a>, an open call to global nonprofits who are building transformative technologies for the billion people around the world with disabilities. We’ve been amazed by the ideas we’ve received, coming from 1,000+ organizations spanning 88 countries. We’ve shared a <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/12/on-idpd-working-toward-more-accessible.html"">handful</a> of the organizations we’re supporting already—and today we’re excited to share the <a href=""https://www.google.org/impactchallenge/disabilities/grants.html"">full list of 30 winners</a>.<br />

<b>The Center for Discovery, $1.125 million Google.org grant </b><br />
Power wheelchairs help provide greater independence to people with mobility limitations—allowing them to get around without a caregiver, or travel longer distances. But power chairs are expensive and often not covered by insurance, leaving many people limited to manual wheelchairs. <br />
<br />
With their Google.org grant, the <a href=""http://www.thecenterfordiscovery.org/"">Center for Discovery</a> will continue developing an open source power add-on device, the indieGo, which quickly converts any manual wheelchair into a power chair. The power add-on will provide the mobility and freedom of a power chair for around one-seventh the average cost, and will allow people who mainly use a manual wheelchair to have the option of using power when they need it. The device design will be open sourced to increase its reach—potentially improving mobility for hundreds of thousands of people. <br />

<b>Perkins School for the Blind, $750,000 Google.org grant</b><br />
Turn-by-turn GPS navigation allows people with visual impairments to get around, but once they get in vicinity of their destination, they often struggle to find specific locations like bus stops or building entrances that GPS isn’t precise enough to identify. (This is often called the “last 50 feet problem.”) Lacking the detailed information they need to find specific new places, people tend to limit themselves to familiar routes, leading to a less independent lifestyle. <br />
<br />
With the support of Google.org, <a href=""http://www.perkins.org/"">Perkins School for the Blind</a> is building tools to crowdsource data from people with sight to help people navigate the last 50 feet. Using an app, people will log navigation clues in a standard format, which will be used to create directions that lead vision-impaired people precisely to their intended destination. Perkins School for the Blind is collaborating with transit authorities who will provide access to transportation data and support Perkin’s mission of making public transportation accessible to everyone. <br />

<b>Miraclefeet, $1 million Google.org grant </b><br />
An estimated 1 million children currently live with untreated clubfoot, a lifelong disability that often leads to isolation, limited access to education, and poverty. Clubfoot can be treated without surgery, but treatment practices are not widely used in many countries around the world. <br />
<br />
<a href=""https://miraclefeet.org/"">Miraclefeet</a> partners with local healthcare providers to increase access to proper treatment for children born with clubfoot. They will use Google.org support to offer support to families via SMS, monitor patient progress through updated software, and provide extensive online training to local clinicians. To date, Miraclefeet has helped facilitate treatment for more than 13,000 children in 13 different countries; this effort will help them significantly scale up their work to reach thousands more.<br />

5861801700906847869,,Google Blogs,2016-04-11T08:15:00-07:00,Building more accessible technology ,"Nearly 20 percent of the U.S. population will have a disability during their lifetime, which can make it hard for them to access and interact with technology, and limits the opportunity that technology can bring. That’s why it’s so important to build tools to make technology accessible to everyone—from people with visual impairments who need screen readers or larger text, to people with motor restrictions that prevent them from interacting with a touch screen, to people with hearing impairments who cannot hear their device’s sounds. Here are some updates we’ve made recently to make our technology more accessible:<br />
<br />
<b>A tool to help develop accessible apps </b><br />
Accessibility Scanner is a <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor"">new tool for Android</a> that lets developers test their own apps and receive suggestions on ways to enhance accessibility. For example, the tool might recommend enlarging small buttons, increasing the contrast between text and its background and more.<br />

<b>Improvements for the visually impaired in Android N</b><br />
A few weeks ago we <a href=""http://developer.android.com/preview/index.html"">announced</a> a preview of Android N for developers. As part of this update we’re bringing Vision Settings—which lets people control settings like magnification, font size, display size and <a href=""https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3529932"">TalkBack</a>—to the Welcome screen that appears when people activate new Android devices.

Our newest version, ChromeVox Next Beta, includes a simplified keyboard shortcut model, a new caption panel to display speech and Braille output, and a new set of navigation sounds. For more information, visit <a href=""http://chromevox.com/"">chromevox.com</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Edit documents with your voice</b><br />
Google Docs now <a href=""https://docs.googleblog.com/2016/02/type-edit-and-format-with-your-voice-in.html"">allows typing, editing and formatting using voice commands</a>—for example, “copy” or “insert table”—making it easier for people who can’t use a touchscreen to edit documents.

These days <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_art"">digital art</a> has spurred new opportunities for creativity, going well beyond good old pencils and paper. It's against this canvas that we bring you <a href=""http://www.tiltbrush.com/"">Tilt Brush</a>—a new virtual reality (VR) app that lets you paint from an entirely new perspective, available today on the <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/327140/"">HTC Vive</a>.<br />
<br />
With Tilt Brush, you can paint in three-dimensional space. Just select your colors and brushes and get going with a wave of your hand. Your room is a blank slate. You can step around, in and through your drawings as you go. And, because it’s in virtual reality, you can even choose to use otherwise-impossible materials like fire, stars or snowflakes.<br />

You probably took photos and videos—lots of them—but didn’t do much beyond posting a couple on social media.

<br />
You can add text captions to the album to describe the view from the <strike>small hill</strike> huge mountain you climbed, and turn on collaboration to let others add their own photos. Or if you want to create one yourself, any existing album can now be customized with maps, location pins, and text.

4740101239842725,,Google Blogs,2016-03-22T00:00:00-07:00,Water organizations using tech to make an impact,"By 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in <a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs391/en/"">water-stressed areas</a>. Already, more than <a href=""http://www.unicef.org/wash/"">663 million people</a> in the world live without clean water. And drought is a major challenge in geographies ranging from Northern California, which is facing its <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL062433/abstract"">worst drought in 1,200 years</a>; to east Africa, where a devastating drought has led to crop failures affecting <a href=""http://www.fao.org/emergencies/crisis/sahel/en/"">an estimated 23 million people</a>.  <br />
<br />
To address challenges at this scale, we need creative solutions—both to raise awareness for these issues, and create new interventions to meet local needs. So this <a href=""http://www.unwater.org/worldwaterday"">World Water Day</a>, we want to highlight a handful of organizations who are using technologies—like virtual reality, data analysis, and mapping—to make a difference.<br />
<br />
<b>Documenting impact with 360 video</b><br />
The nonprofit organization <a href=""https://donate.charitywater.org/donate/home"">charity:water</a> uses the power of crowd-fundraising to build wells in communities with limited access to clean water. Since 2006, they’ve funded more than 19,000 water projects in 24 countries that will serve more than 6 million people. Three years ago, Google.org gave charity:water a <a href=""http://www.charitywater.org/blog/google-impact-award/"">US$5 million grant</a> to build well sensors that notify local mechanics of the need for repair—helping ensure ongoing access to clean water and creating new local jobs. <br />
<br />
Today, charity:water is releasing <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlVIsVfWwS4&amp;feature=youtu.be"">The Source</a> </i>on YouTube 360, a virtual reality film that documents the before-and-after impact of one of these well projects in Ethiopia.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/nlVIsVfWwS4"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><i>To view the video in 360, press play and use the arrows on the cursor in the upper left-hand corner to look up, down, right and left.</i></div><b>Mapping our waterways with Street View in Google Maps</b><br />
With California in its worst drought in recorded history, the need to understand and manage the state’s rivers, lakes, and watersheds is acute. Environmental organizations like the <a href=""http://www.conserveca.org/"">Nature Conservancy, California</a> and the <a href=""http://www.thefreshwatertrust.org/"">Freshwater Trust</a> have borrowed the Street View Trekker—used as a backpack and mounted on a kayak—to capture 360-degree imagery. These images are useful in many ways; for The Nature Conservancy, the data will provide baseline imagery to compare forest growth and regrowth over time. The Freshwater Trust is using the imagery to validate their scientific models of the river, and prioritize areas for restoration, such as planting of native plant species along the banks.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dCYGY44CNTw/VvDYQ8V3ghI/AAAAAAAASEU/Zpf_iWzEDkAQRvLmAxzB3tOQqzzdVWDLQ/s1600/488x-1.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""398"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dCYGY44CNTw/VvDYQ8V3ghI/AAAAAAAASEU/Zpf_iWzEDkAQRvLmAxzB3tOQqzzdVWDLQ/s640/488x-1.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></div><i>The Freshwater Trust scientist guides the Trekker-mounted kayak down the Russian River, capturing 360-degree imagery as he floats.

<br />
<b>Monitoring clean water with sensors</b><br />
When it comes to water contamination in rural areas, collecting reliable data is often one of the biggest challenges. In 2014, a nonprofit called Associacao O Eco won the <a href=""https://desafiosocial.withgoogle.com/brazil2014/charity/associacao-o-eco"">Google Impact Challenge: Brazil</a> with a proposal for a data-collection project called <a href=""http://infoamazonia.org/"">InfoAmazonia</a>. The project will deploy a network of sensors that send a text message to local citizens and officials if contamination is detected. In the next phase of the project, the organization plans to create an open-source toolkit and citizen-led initiative that enables local people to install these sensors, understand their own data, and advocate for a cleaner water supply.<br />

<b>Water tracking with satellites</b><br />
Between 2011-2012, Africa endured its <a href=""http://www.fao.org/emergencies/crisis/sahel/en/"">worst drought in 50 years</a>. Without water, crop failures have lead to <a href=""http://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/sahel-call-humanitarian-aid-responding-needs-people-affected-crises-sahel-enar"">malnourishment and displacement across the region</a>. To help with the relief efforts, we gave a grant to the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) for satellite imaging technologies to assess crop availability, monitor water quality in Lakes Victoria and Malawi, and provide data for an early warning system for floods and fires. <br />
<br />
The near real-time data capture has helped local officials make informed decisions about managing water resources, and addressing food security in the region.<br />

<b>Help raise awareness on water issues</b><br />
This year, water nonprofit <a href=""http://drop4drop.org/"">Drop4Drop</a> is asking people to complete the sentence “W is for…”  in order to raise awareness for the global clean water crisis. To us, “W is for... Water organizations using tech to make an impact.” The solutions to the world’s water challenges are complex, and some will take years to achieve. These organizations are applying technology to these challenges in new and unique ways, and we’re glad to play a small part.<br />
<br />
We encourage you to write your own “W is for…” post and use the hashtag #W4Water to join the conversation on social media. <br />

Given the contest’s theme—“What makes me...me”—who better than the young artist herself to answer that question?</i> - Ed.<br />
<br />
When I was younger, I attended <a href=""http://www.rootspcs.org/about_us.html"">Roots Public Charter School</a> and <a href=""http://www.rootsactivitylc.org/"">Roots Activity Learning Center</a> in Northwest Washington, D.C. These schools promote a strong connection to African heritage, and an Afrocentric lifestyle; we regularly celebrated important African American people and I learned a lot about my history as an African American. As I grew older, I realized that the black people that came before us have made us into what we are today. So of course I had to include them in my doodle on the theme “What makes me...me.”<br />
<br />
My goal with my art was to not only turn heads but souls as well—not only for someone to see it and be amazed by it but also to have them understand and connect with it. My drawing explores childhood themes and then moves into reflections on our society. Everything surrounding the word ""Google"" depicts my characteristics. Of all the things I chose to include, the six most special to me are the Symbol of Life (the ankh), the African continent, where everything began for me and my ancestors, the Eye of Horus, the word ""power"" drawn in black, the woman's fist based on one of my favorite artist’s works, and the D.C. flag—because I’m a Washingtonian at heart and I love my city with everything in me!<br />

Winning this competition opened my eyes to the many types of art and the many ways it can resonate with people. I’m excited to keep creating art that matters.</div><br />

We've also had the chance to see something that's never happened before: <a href=""https://deepmind.com/"">DeepMind</a>'s AlphaGo took on and defeated legendary Go player, Lee Sedol (9-dan professional with 18 world titles), marking a major milestone for artificial intelligence.<br />

Go may be one of the oldest games in existence, but the attention to our five-game tournament exceeded even our wildest imaginations. Searches for Go rules and Go boards spiked in the U.S. In China, tens of millions watched live streams of the matches, and the “Man vs. Machine Go Showdown” hashtag saw 200 million pageviews on Sina Weibo. Sales of Go boards even <a href=""http://www.hankookilbo.com/m/v/3e7deaa26a834f76929a1689ecd388ea"">surged</a> in Korea.<br />
<br />
Our public test of AlphaGo, however, was about more than winning at Go. We founded DeepMind in 2010 to create general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) that can learn on its own—and, eventually, be used as a tool to help society solve some of its biggest and most pressing problems, from climate change to disease diagnosis. <br />
<br />
Like many researchers before us, we've been developing and testing our algorithms through games. We first revealed <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/01/alphago-machine-learning-game-go.html"">AlphaGo</a> in January—the first AI program that could beat a professional player at the most complex board game mankind has devised, using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning"">deep learning</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning"">reinforcement learning</a>. The <a href=""https://deepmind.com/alpha-go.html"">ultimate challenge</a> was for AlphaGo to take on the best Go player of the past decade—Lee Sedol. <br />
<br />
To everyone's surprise, including ours, AlphaGo won four of the five games. Commentators noted that AlphaGo played many unprecedented, creative, and even <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2016/03/sadness-beauty-watching-googles-ai-play-go/"">“beautiful”</a> moves. Based on our data, AlphaGo’s bold <a href=""https://youtu.be/l-GsfyVCBu0?t=1h17m50s"">move 37</a> in Game 2 had a 1 in 10,000 chance of being played by a human. Lee countered with innovative moves of his own, such as his <a href=""https://youtu.be/yCALyQRN3hw?t=3h10m25s"">move 78</a> against AlphaGo in Game 4—again, a 1 in 10,000 chance of being played—which ultimately resulted in a win.<br />
<br />
The final score was 4-1. We're contributing the $1 million in prize money to organizations that support science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education and Go, as well as UNICEF. <br />
<br />
We’ve learned two important things from this experience. First, this test bodes well for AI’s potential in solving other problems. AlphaGo has the ability to look “globally” across a board—and find solutions that humans either have been trained not to play or would not consider. This has huge potential for using AlphaGo-like technology to find solutions that humans don’t necessarily see in other areas. Second, while the match has been widely billed as ""man vs. machine,"" AlphaGo is really a human achievement. Lee Sedol and the AlphaGo team both pushed each other toward new ideas, opportunities and solutions—and in the long run that's something we all stand to benefit from.<br />
<br />
But as they say about Go in Korean: “Don’t be arrogant when you win or you’ll lose your luck.” This is just one small, albeit significant, step along the way to making machines smart. We’ve demonstrated that our cutting edge deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to make strong Go and <a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.sg/2015/02/from-pixels-to-actions-human-level.html"">Atari</a> players. Deep neural networks are already used at Google for specific tasks—like <a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.sg/2013/06/improving-photo-search-step-across.html"">image recognition</a>, <a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.sg/2015/08/the-neural-networks-behind-google-voice.html"">speech recognition</a>, and <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-26/google-turning-its-lucrative-web-search-over-to-ai-machines"">Search ranking</a>. However, we’re still a long way from a machine that can learn to flexibly perform the full range of intellectual tasks a human can—the hallmark of true <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence"">artificial general intelligence</a>.<br />

With this tournament, we wanted to test the limits of AlphaGo. The genius of Lee Sedol did that brilliantly—and we’ll spend the next few weeks studying the games he and AlphaGo played in detail. And because the machine learning methods we’ve used in AlphaGo are general purpose, we hope to apply some of these techniques to other challenges in the future. Game on!<br />

3744839342134933143,,Google Blogs,2016-03-08T21:00:00-08:00,New ways to plan your vacation while on the go,"With spring around the corner, it’s time to look forward to sunnier skies—and summer getaways. These days, mobile phones make it easier than ever for you to sneak in vacation dreaming and planning here and there—in line at the coffee shop, waiting at the doctor’s office, or on your way to meet a friend. <br />
<br />
In fact, last year, according to our internal data for google.com, we saw a whopping 50 percent increase in travel-related questions on mobile phones. But even as that number grows, it can be hard to get all the right information in one place on a small screen. There are a dizzying number of questions to answer when planning a trip: What are the best places to visit? What time of year is good to go? What kind of prices can I expect?<br />
<br />
Today we’re introducing something to make all this easier: Destinations on Google, which helps you discover and plan your next vacation, right from Google Search on your phone.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/EnlsEyN7qmw"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
Here’s how it works:<br />
<br />
Search with Google on your mobile phone for the continent, country, or state you’d like to travel to and add the word “destination” to see an easy-to-browse collection of options. Destinations integrates a deep understanding of all the places in the world with <a href=""https://www.google.com/flights/"">Google Flights</a> and <a href=""https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6276008"">Hotel search</a>, so you can see available flight and hotel prices <i>instantly</i>. So instead of jumping between a dozen links or tabs to get the information you need, you can sit back and scroll—and leave the heavy lifting to us.<br />
<a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TcQFHCDPXt8/Vt-E1q0XBlI/AAAAAAAASBQ/BlkhtZI3Dqg/s1600/Destinations_on_Google_2_030816.gif"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TcQFHCDPXt8/Vt-E1q0XBlI/AAAAAAAASBQ/BlkhtZI3Dqg/s640/Destinations_on_Google_2_030816.gif"" /></a><br />
To find a vacation that’s just your style, search for a destination and something you’d like to do there, like “spain surfing,” “new zealand hiking,” or “colorado skiing.” We’ll suggest spots that fit with your hobbies and interests.<br />
<a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5p9fRR3wC7A/Vt-E1rGnPtI/AAAAAAAASBU/ZhjKperJfKk/s1600/Destinations_on_Google_3_030816.gif"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5p9fRR3wC7A/Vt-E1rGnPtI/AAAAAAAASBU/ZhjKperJfKk/s640/Destinations_on_Google_3_030816.gif"" /></a><br />
Say you’re planning to take some time off in June or July, but you haven’t decided exactly when to go. The “Flexible Dates” filter lets you refine your results by month, so you can see when fares and rates are lowest within the time range you want, across multiple destinations.<br />
<a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GBuuXkBlu94/Vt-E1nU7AsI/AAAAAAAASBY/AyrneUYLt30/s1600/Destinations_on_Google_4_030816.gif"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GBuuXkBlu94/Vt-E1nU7AsI/AAAAAAAASBY/AyrneUYLt30/s640/Destinations_on_Google_4_030816.gif"" /></a><br />
Want to avoid crowds or bad weather? Select any destination and tap the “Explore” tab to see what the weather is like year-round and when your destination is most popular, based on historic visits from other travelers.<br />
<a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3G4qOk4_SbY/Vt-E2XO0zDI/AAAAAAAASBc/lQisL8_ru44/s1600/Destinations_on_Google_5_030816.gif"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3G4qOk4_SbY/Vt-E2XO0zDI/AAAAAAAASBc/lQisL8_ru44/s640/Destinations_on_Google_5_030816.gif"" /></a><br />
Once you've selected a destination, tap ""Plan a trip"" to see rates for hotels and flights. We show you highs and lows for the next six months, so you can find the right price tag for you.  And as you slide left or right, the results instantly update with real-time fares and rates, pulling from the trillions of flight itineraries and hotels we price every day on&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.google.com/flights/"">Google Flights</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6276008"">Hotel search</a>.&nbsp;You can also tap the pencil icon to customize&nbsp;results further with flight and hotel preferences, including number of stops, hotel class, and number of travelers.<br />
<a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WFlPRWgv__4/Vt-E3fMdWCI/AAAAAAAASBg/VWuuDl9Z384/s1600/Destinations_on_Google_6_030816.gif"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WFlPRWgv__4/Vt-E3fMdWCI/AAAAAAAASBg/VWuuDl9Z384/s640/Destinations_on_Google_6_030816.gif"" /></a><br />
Whether you’ve got five days or 12, don’t fret about figuring out where to go first or which spots you can’t miss. Simply search for “Spain travel,” and click the blue arrow icon to browse the most frequently traveled itineraries. The suggested itineraries are based on historic visits by other travelers to those places, so you can use the wisdom of the crowd and save time researching.<br />
<a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B9JEc0pVuoA/Vt-E3tqxsMI/AAAAAAAASBk/7z71tc2CP7A/s1600/Destinations_on_Google_7_030816.gif"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B9JEc0pVuoA/Vt-E3tqxsMI/AAAAAAAASBk/7z71tc2CP7A/s640/Destinations_on_Google_7_030816.gif"" /></a><br />

It’s always an honor to pay tribute to women who have changed the course of history, sometimes in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. But for this year’s <a href=""http://g.co/iwd"">International Women’s Day</a>, we wanted to celebrate the Doodle-worthy women of the future. So we gathered our cameras and pencils and visited 13 countries where we asked 337 women and girls to complete the sentence, “One day I will…” This is what they told us:<br />
<div><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ztMIb6nEeyg"" width=""640""></iframe></div><i>Our video Doodle was created by three women on the Doodle team (Liat Ben-Rafael, Lydia Nichols, and Helene Leroux) and features original music by Merrill Garbus (<a href=""http://tuneyards.com/"">tUnE-yArDs</a>).</i><br />
<br />
From toddlers to grandmothers, the women in San Francisco, Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City, Lagos, Moscow, Cairo, Berlin, London, Paris, Jakarta, Bangkok, New Delhi and Tokyo all sparkled with personality. Each new city brought more “One day I will”s, more signature dance moves, more hugs, more high-fives. The aspirations we heard were as varied as the women and girls who shared them, from the very personal—swim with pigs in the Bahamas—to the very global—give a voice to those who can’t speak—and everything in between. When it was done, we found that our own “One day I will…”s had grown bigger and richer, inspired by the women we’d met.<br />
<br />
Even women who are already accomplished aren’t done dreaming. Jane Goodall shared her hope to one day discuss the environment with the Pope, while Nobel Prize Winner Malala Yousafzai and activist Muzoon Almellehan continue to work fearlessly toward a future where every girl can go to school.<br />

<br />
It’s not always easy to put into words what you want to achieve. When we asked women and girls on the street to articulate their aspirations, they often had to pause and think about it for a few minutes. Whether their responses were detailed or broad strokes, concrete or abstract, funny or heartwarming, it was inspiring to see them take the time to dream.<br />
<br />
Now it’s your turn. Share your aspiration with <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/OneDayIWill"">#OneDayIWill</a> and get one step closer to where you’re going. You never know, you could be the subject of a doodle yourself someday...<br />

They’re in a $30 million competition called the <a href=""http://lunar.xprize.org/"">Google Lunar XPRIZE</a> (GLXP), which challenges teams to design and build a rover, land it on the surface of the moon, drive it 500 meters across the lunar landscape, and send HD video and imagery back to Earth by the end of 2017. And soon, you’ll be able to learn their stories in a new digital documentary series from Google, Academy Award®-nominated director Orlando von Einsiedel, Executive Producer J.J. Abrams, Bad Robot, and Epic Digital. <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/cuXxBoSYmfc"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
The GLXP competition, which started in 2007, aims to kick off a new era of space exploration by enabling low-cost and efficient access to the moon. Not only is the moon our closest neighbor in space, it’s also the gateway to exploring the rest of the universe—and provides opportunities for discovery in the fields of science, technology, and human habitation.<br />
<br />
The teams in the competition come from all walks of life, from Silicon Valley tech experts, to hackers in Germany, to IT specialists in India, to a father and son working out of their their Vancouver apartment. In a series of 9 digital documentaries, <i>Moon Shot</i> goes behind the scenes with each team, bringing to life their challenges, sacrifices, quirks, and most importantly, the reasons why they’re making the 238,900 mile journey to the moon. <br />

7905715149045096096,,Google Blogs,2016-03-03T00:01:00-08:00,Providing support to combat Zika in Brazil and beyond,"The recent Zika virus outbreak has caused concern around the world. We’ve seen more than a <a href=""https://googledataorg.cartodb.com/u/googledata/viz/8642706a-dfef-11e5-9f8a-42010a14800b/embed_map"">3,000 percent increase in global search interest</a>&nbsp;since November, and last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a <a href=""http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/en/"">Public Health Emergency</a>. The possible correlation with <a href=""http://www.who.int/csr/don/8-january-2016-brazil-microcephaly/en/"">Zika, microcephaly and other birth defects</a> is particularly alarming. <br />
<br />
But unlike many other global pandemics, the spread of Zika has been harder to identify, map and contain. It’s believed that <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/zika/symptoms/"">4 in 5 people</a> with the virus don’t show any symptoms, and the primary transmitter for the disease, the <i>Aedes</i> mosquito species, is both widespread and challenging to eliminate. That means that fighting Zika requires raising awareness on how people can protect themselves, as well as supporting organizations who can help drive the development of rapid diagnostics and vaccines. We also have to find better ways to visualize the threat so that public health officials and NGO’s can support communities at risk. <br />
<br />
As a company whose mission is helping people find information, with a lot of experience in analyzing large sets of data, we’re in a good position to help—at scale and at speed. So today we have Google engineers working with UNICEF to analyze data to determine how to map and anticipate the virus. We’ve also made some updates to our products to make Zika information more accessible, and we’re providing <a href=""https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/what-you-need-know-about-zika-unicef-mosquito-borne-disease/29885"">UNICEF</a> with a $1 million grant to help their efforts on the ground.<br />
<br />
<b>Mapping information to help with prevention </b><br />
A volunteer team of Google engineers, designers, and data scientists is helping UNICEF build a platform to process data from different sources (i.e., weather and travel patterns) in order to visualize potential outbreaks. Ultimately, the goal of this open source platform is to identify the risk of Zika transmission for different regions and help UNICEF, governments and NGO’s decide how and where to focus their time and resources. This set of tools is being prototyped for the Zika response, but will also be applicable to future emergencies. <br />

6139157699465683938,,Google Blogs,2016-02-26T09:00:00-08:00,Strengthening our commitment to racial justice,"I started working with Dr. Carl Mack when I took an engineering internship in my hometown of Seattle. But it wasn’t long before my internship took me in a completely different direction. The city was <a href=""http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Anger-tears-prayers-as-black-man-killed-by-1085351.php"">on high alert</a> in the wake of racial discrimination and violence, and Dr. Mack was the VP of the city’s NAACP chapter. At his side, I was soon participating in protests and closed door meetings with city leaders—opening my eyes to non-technical solutions, and setting me off on a path that would eventually lead me to <a href=""http://google.org/"">Google.org</a>, where today I lead giving projects focused on the Bay Area and on racial justice. <br />
<br />
More recently, incidences of racial violence have again dominated our headlines, with the killing of young men like Tamir Rice and Jordan Davis, the deaths of Michael Brown and Sandra Bland, and countless other acts of injustice. And it isn’t just heartbreaking individual stories. The data is troubling: African Americans are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of whites. An estimated 40 percent of all students expelled from U.S. schools are black, and 30 percent are Latino. Of course, Google and our own industry <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/doing-more-on-diversity.html"">need to do more</a> to promote equality and opportunities for all. <br />
<br />
Social innovators can help us move closer to our ideals of equality and justice. That’s why last year, Google.org launched a new, dedicated effort to support leaders who are doing critical work to end mass incarceration and combat endemic educational inequality for black and brown students. We <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/11/03/google-grants-racial-justice/75096508/"">announced $2.35 million in grants</a> to support leaders like #BlackLivesMatter co-founder <a href=""http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2016/02/08/big-think-patrisse-cullors-on-law-enforcement-violence"">Patrisse Cullors</a>;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/education/edlife/in-oakland-building-boys-into-men.html?_r=0"">Chris Chatmon</a>, who leads Oakland's African American Male Achievement Initiative; and <a href=""http://www.equalvoiceforfamilies.org/silicon-valley-de-bug-gets-600k-from-google-for-justice-reform/"">Raj Jayadev</a>, who founded the criminal justice reform organization Silicon Valley De-Bug.<br />

<br />
Today, I'm excited to continue that momentum with the addition of four more organizations in this space, totalling $3 million in new grants. To help eliminate racial bias within our educational systems, we’re supporting San Francisco’s <a href=""http://sparksfpublicschools.com/my-brother-and-sisters-keeper"">My Brother and Sister's Keeper (MBSK) program</a>, Oakland’s <a href=""http://rosesinconcrete.org/"">Roses in Concrete Community School</a>, and the tech-enabled college success startup, <a href=""http://www.beyond12.org/"">Beyond12</a>.

5759783752079078289,,Google Blogs,2016-02-25T02:00:00-08:00,Protecting the world's news from digital attack,"The web is an increasingly critical tool for news organizations, allowing them to communicate faster, research more easily, and disseminate their work to a global audience. Often it's the primary distribution channel for critical, investigative work that shines a light into the darkest corners of society and the economy—the kind of reporting that exposes wrongdoing, causes upset and brings about change. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately there are some out there who want to prevent this kind of reporting—to silence journalism when it’s needed most. A simple, inexpensive distributed <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack"">denial of service (DDoS) attack</a> can be carried out by almost anyone with access to a computer—and take a site completely offline before its owners even know they’ve been attacked.<br />
<br />
These attacks threaten free expression and access to information—two of Google’s core values. So a few years ago we created <a href=""http://g.co/shield"">Project Shield</a>, an effort that uses Google’s security infrastructure to detect and filter attacks on news and human rights websites. Now we’re expanding Project Shield beyond our trusted testers, and opening it up to all the world’s news sites to protect them from DDoS attacks and eliminate DDoS as a form of censorship. <br />
<br />
We learned a lot from our early group of Project Shield testers. Not only have we kept websites online during attacks that otherwise would have taken them offline, we learned crucial information about how these types of attacks happen, and how we can improve our services to defend against them. <br />
<br />
With this expansion, tens of thousands of news sites will have access to Project Shield. And because Project Shield is free, even the smallest independent news organizations will be able to continue their important work without the fear of being shut down. <br />
<br />
Finally, Project Shield is not just about protecting journalism. It’s about improving the health of the Internet by mitigating against a significant threat for publishers and people who want to publish content that some might find inconvenient. A free and open Internet depends on protecting the free flow of information—starting with the news.<br />
<br />
Visit our <a href=""http://g.co/shield"">website</a> to learn how Project Shield works and, if you work in journalism, discover how you can join the fight to protect the world’s news. <br />

<br />
On February 1 we kicked off <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/02/preserving-celebrating-black-history.html"">Black History Month</a> with a <a href=""http://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-frederick-douglass"">Doodle</a> recognizing the remarkable life of Frederick Douglass and a new collection of Black history archives on the <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/u/0/project/black-history-and-culture"">Cultural Institute</a>. Googlers around the world have joined in the celebrations, hosting film screenings, spoken word performances, speaker series, and participating in community service. These efforts have been driven by the <a href=""https://www.google.com/diversity/at-google.html"">Black Googler Network</a> (BGN), one of Google’s largest employee resource groups with 12 branches worldwide.  <br />
<br />
BGN focuses on empowering the Black community at Google and beyond. BGN Googlers work on many different teams, participating in BGN as volunteers or in their 20 percent time. They run service trips to communities in need, provide professional development and mentorship programs, convene dialogues on topics affecting the Black community, and help Googlers connect with each other and develop a sense of community.  They’ve also driven social justice movements across the company, including <a href=""https://twitter.com/google/status/614551995442143232?lang=en"">solidarity for #BlackLivesMatter</a> and $2.35 million in&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/11/03/google-grants-racial-justice/75096508/"">funding</a> from Google.org for racial justice innovators.<br />
<br />
As Black History Month comes to a close, we asked some of these Googlers to share what they’re working on both in their day jobs and within BGN.<br />

Giving back is core to BGN’s work: our Annual Outreach Trip convenes members from around the world for several days of service. In 2015 we went to Charleston, SC, where we conducted coding workshops for around 100 students and parents to expose them to computer science and how creative, collaborative, and fun it can be. The year prior, we held a Social Media 101 training for 100+ small business owners in Atlanta. Everyone deserves equal access to opportunity, whether it’s computer science education or the economic benefits of the Internet. I’m proud to have Google’s support while doing work that affirms <a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/0/+google/posts/YzjyMwjdmoE?cfem=1&amp;e=-RedirectToSandbox"">#BlackLivesMatter</a>.<br />

BGN has always been an important part of my Google experience: I supported the revival of our Atlanta chapter, served for three years on our service-oriented Outreach Leadership Team, and integrated our smaller data center chapters into a stronger, more supportive unit—BGN@datacenters.<br />
<br />
I also work on projects to expand access to technology in my local community. I serve as a <a href=""https://www.cs-first.com/?utm_expid=95153827-4.RZJuoS41RYqV7APMxoWyVA.0&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F"">CS First</a> program evangelist, helping engage diverse students in computer science learning, and I’m a Diversity Ambassador advancing our diversity work in the data centers.

This theme of inclusion is powerful for me: when I first came to Google, I felt a bit isolated. I was not only a Black woman in Tech, but also working in the corporate social responsibility space, where there aren’t many Black folks. Joining BGN was critical in helping me feel like I could truly be myself at Google, with all my triumphs, tribulations, and differences included.<br />
<br />
These days, I’m passionate about making Google a place where <i>everyone</i> is comfortable being themselves. In my role on the GooglersGive team, a program which gets Googlers involved in charitable giving and community service, I’ve coordinated opportunities for Googlers to use their spare time giving back in places ranging from Oakland and Harlem to Ghana and South Africa. Projects include teaching students computer science skills, conducting outreach to at-risk youth, and working with communities struggling with homelessness and abuse.<br />

8969855062473424319,,Google Blogs,2016-02-24T07:00:00-08:00,AMPing up in mobile Search ,"Access to information is at the heart of Google’s mission. Unfortunately, today, the mobile web isn't living up to the expectations people have for getting the information they need, particularly when it comes to speed. In fact, data shows that people abandon websites after just <a href=""https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/speed-is-key-optimize-your-mobile-experience.html"">three seconds</a> if the content doesn't load quickly—which is bad not just for people trying to get what they want online, but for the publishers who want those readers to enjoy the content they've created for them. That's why, last October, we joined others across the industry on the <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/introducing-accelerated-mobile-pages.html"">Accelerated Mobile Pages Project</a> (AMP for short), an open source initiative to make the mobile web as fast as possible. <br />
<br />
In just over four months, AMP has come a long way, with hundreds of publishers, scores of technology companies and ad-tech businesses all taking part in this joint mission to improve the mobile web for everyone. And starting today, we’ll make it easy to find AMP webpages in relevant mobile search results, giving you a lightning-fast reading experience for top stories.   <br />
<br />
Now when you search for a story or topic on Google from a mobile device, webpages created using AMP will appear when relevant in the Top Stories section of the search results page. Any story you choose to read will load blazingly fast—and it’s easy to scroll through the article without it taking forever to load or jumping all around as you read. It’s also easy to quickly flip through the search results just by swiping from one full-page AMP story to the next.<br />
<br />
AMP is great for browsing the web on mobile devices, because webpages built with AMP load an average of four times faster and use 10 times less data than equivalent non-AMP pages. In many cases, they’ll load instantly. It's how reading on the mobile web should be—fast, responsive and fun.  <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v4HwU0Bb2H4/Vs0mLBtKsqI/AAAAAAAAR3c/JfjaZcVl3hc/s1600/AMP_v6_phone_cropped.mov.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""640"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v4HwU0Bb2H4/Vs0mLBtKsqI/AAAAAAAAR3c/JfjaZcVl3hc/s640/AMP_v6_phone_cropped.mov.gif"" width=""384"" /></a></div>While helping people find fast AMP content through Google Search is a significant step, there’s still a lot of work ahead for the <a href=""http://www.ampproject.org/"">open source AMP Project</a>. Still, it’s been thrilling to see how the industry has come together to work on this common goal of making the mobile web great for everyone. And given the potential AMP holds for other types of content, we’re excited about what the future holds.<br />

I was sitting in my 10th grade science class when my teacher asked us: “What will you try?” I loved the invitation—and the challenge—that the Google Science Fair offered. It was a chance to use science to do something that could really make a difference in the world.<br />
<br />
I had always been curious and interested in science, and knew I wanted to submit a project, but didn’t really know exactly where to begin. I asked my teacher for his advice on selecting a research topic. He encouraged me to choose something that I felt passionate about, or something that outraged me, and told me to look at the world around me for inspiration. So I did. At that time, the Ebola crisis was all over the news. It was a devastating situation and I wanted to help be a part of the solution. I had found my project. <br />
<br />
With the outbreak spreading so quickly, I decided that I wanted to find a way to diagnose the virus earlier so that treatment could be delivered as quickly as possible to those who were affected. I read online about silk’s amazing storage and stabilizing properties, and wondered if I could use silk to transport antibodies that could test for the virus. After many failed attempts (and cutting up lots of cocoons) I finally succeeded in creating a temperature-independent, portable, and inexpensive diagnostic test that could detect the Ebola virus in under 30 minutes. I was really excited that my research could help contribute to saving lives, and I was proud to be selected as the Grand Prize winner a few months later.<br />
<br />
As the 2016 Google Science Fair launches today, I wanted to share a few tips from my own experience: First, as my teacher once guided me to do, look at the world around you for ideas. If you’re stuck, try the <a href=""http://googlesciencefair.com/make-better-generator/en/"">Make Better Generator</a> to find something that excites or inspires you. Second, find a mentor who’s interested in the same things as you. There are a lot of <a href=""https://www.googlesciencefair.com/en/participants"">helpful ideas</a> on the GSF site to get you started. And finally, don’t get discouraged—often what first appears like failure can teach you so much more. <br />
<br />
I urge other teenagers like me to take this opportunity to find a way to make the world around them better. Every one of us, no matter our age or background, can make a difference—and as young people, we’re not always so afraid to try things that adults think will fail. But change doesn’t happen overnight, and it often starts with a question. So look at the world around you and challenge yourself to make something better.<br />

189606000734960069,,Google Blogs,2016-02-09T09:03:00-08:00,"Building a safer web, for everyone ","Today is <a href=""https://www.saferinternetday.org/web/usa/sid"">Safer Internet Day</a>, a moment for technology companies, nonprofit organizations, security firms, and people around the world to focus on online safety, together. To mark the occasion, we’re rolling out new tools, and some useful reminders, to help protect you from online dangers of all stripes—phishing, malware, and other threats to your personal information.<br />
<br />
<b>1. Keeping security settings simple</b><br />
<br />
The <a href=""https://security.google.com/settings/security/secureaccount?utm_source=ogb-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-pr&amp;utm_campaign=safer-internet-day"">Security Checkup</a> is a quick way to control the security settings for your Google Account. You can add a recovery phone number so we can help if you’re ever locked out of your account, strengthen your password settings, see which devices are connected to your account, and more. If you complete the Security Checkup by February 11, you’ll also get <a href=""http://googledrive.blogspot.com/2016/02/safer-internet-day-2016.html"">2GB of extra Google Drive storage</a>, which can be used across Google Drive, Gmail, and Photos.<br />
<br />
Safer Internet Day is a great time to do it, but you can—and should!—take a Security Checkup on a regular basis. Start your Security Checkup by visiting <a href=""https://myaccount.google.com/"">My Account</a>.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WdNReAvdDFM/VrocQdIoHbI/AAAAAAAAR1M/SEBM2vUBMog/s1600/SID_FB_001.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""480"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WdNReAvdDFM/VrocQdIoHbI/AAAAAAAAR1M/SEBM2vUBMog/s640/SID_FB_001.gif"" width=""640"" /></a></div><b>2. Informing Gmail users about potentially unsafe messages</b><br />
<br />
If you and your Grandpa both use Gmail to exchange messages, your connections are <a href=""http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/03/staying-at-forefront-of-email-security.html"">encrypted</a> and <a href=""https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2013/12/internet-wide-efforts-to-fight-email.html"">authenticated</a>. That means no peering eyes can read those emails as they zoom across the web, and you can be confident that the message from your Grandpa in size 48 font (with no punctuation and a few misspellings) is really from him!<br />
<br />
However, as our <a href=""https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/saferemail/"">Safer Email Transparency Report</a> explains, these things are not always true when Gmail interacts with other mail services. Today, we’re introducing changes in Gmail on the web to let people know when a received message was not encrypted, if you’re composing a message to a recipient whose email service doesn’t support TLS encryption, or when the sender’s domain couldn’t be authenticated.<br />
<br />
Here’s the notice you’ll see in Gmail before you send a message to a service that doesn’t support <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/saferemail/tls/?hl=en"">TLS encryption</a>. You’ll also see the broken lock icon if you receive a message that was sent without TLS&nbsp;encryption.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2H0Pf1jkirM/VrobB3zsSlI/AAAAAAAAR08/nOOdmWNsfRw/s1600/notice%2Bone.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""580"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2H0Pf1jkirM/VrobB3zsSlI/AAAAAAAAR08/nOOdmWNsfRw/s640/notice%2Bone.gif"" width=""640"" /></a></div><br />
If you receive a message that can’t be authenticated, you’ll see a question mark where you might otherwise see a profile photo or logo:<br />

<div><b>3. Protecting you from bad apps</b><br />
<br />
Dangerous apps that phish and steal your personal information, or hold your phone hostage and make you pay to unlock it, have no place on your smartphone—or any device, for that matter.<br />
<br />
Google Play helps protect your Android device by rejecting bad apps that don’t comply with our <a href=""http://www.android.com/us/developer-content-policy.html#showlanguages"">Play policies</a>. It also conducts more than 200 million daily security scans of devices, in tandem with our <a href=""https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/safebrowsing/"">Safe Browsing</a> system, for any signs of trouble. Last year, bad apps were installed on fewer than 0.13% of Android devices that install apps only from Google Play.<br />
<br />
Learn more about these, and other Android security features — like app sandboxing, <a href=""http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2015/08/an-update-to-nexus-devices.html"">monthly security updates</a> for Nexus and other devices, and our <a href=""https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/06/announcing-security-rewards-for-android.html"">Security Rewards Program</a>—in new research we’ve made public on our <a href=""http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2016/02/safety-first-four-easy-android-security.html"">Android blog</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>4. Busting bad advertising practices </b><br />
<br />
Malicious advertising “botnets” try to send phony visitors to websites to make money from online ads. Botnets threaten the businesses of honest advertisers and publishers, and because they’re often made up of devices infected with malware, they put users in harm’s way too. <br />
<br />
We've worked to keep botnets out of our ads systems, cutting them out of advertising revenue, and making it harder to make money from distributing malware and <a href=""https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/12/year-one-progress-in-fight-against.html"">Unwanted Software</a>. Now, as part of our effort to <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/01/better-ads-report.html"">fight bad ads online</a>, we’re reinforcing our existing botnet defenses by automatically filtering traffic from three of the top ad fraud botnets, comprising more than 500,000 infected user machines. Learn more about this update on the <a href=""http://doubleclickadvertisers.blogspot.com/2016/02/booting-bots-new-botnet-protections.html"">Doubleclick blog</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>5. Moving the security conversation forward </b><br />
<br />
Recent events—<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#Global_surveillance_disclosures"">Edward Snowden’s disclosures</a>, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Entertainment_hack"">Sony Hack</a>, the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/12/08/you-already-use-encryption-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-it/"">current conversation around encryption</a>, and more—have made online safety a truly mainstream issue. This is reflected both in news headlines, and popular culture: “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot_(TV_series)"">Mr. Robot</a>,” a TV series about hacking and cybersecurity, just won a Golden Globe for Best Drama, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity"">@SwiftOnSecurity</a>, a popular security commentator, is named after Taylor Swift. <br />
<br />
But despite this shift, security remains a complex topic that lends itself to lively debates between experts...that are often unintelligible to just about everyone else. We need to simplify the way we talk about online security to enable everyone to understand its importance and participate in this conversation.<br />
<br />
To that end, we’re teaming up with <a href=""https://medium.com/"">Medium</a> to host a virtual roundtable about online security, present and future. Moderated by journalist and security researcher <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Poulsen"">Kevin Poulsen</a>, this project aims to present fresh perspectives about online security in a time when our attention is increasingly ruled by the devices we carry with us constantly. We hope you’ll <a href=""http://me.dm/roundtable"">tune in</a> and check it out.<br />
<br />
Online security and safety are being discussed more often, and with more urgency, than ever before. We hope you’ll take a few minutes today to learn how Google protects your data and how we can work toward a safer web, for everyone.<br />

5996013638035979764,,Google Blogs,2016-02-01T03:00:00-08:00,"Preserving and celebrating Black history, arts and culture","Growing up, my parents were daily reminders of the sacrifices made by earlier generations of Black Americans to give people like me the opportunities they were denied. To this day, their stories propel me to continue the fight for justice. I am far from alone—reflecting on a shared history inspires millions around the world to work toward equality. But without some record, those stories and the passion they ignite could get lost.<br />
<br />
Artworks, artifacts and archives have the power not only to give a story life, but to encourage action and incite change. That’s why the Google Cultural Institute is excited to add records from institutions like the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Studio Museum and Amistad Research Center and many more—bringing together <a href=""http://g.co/blackhistory"">important archives from Black history</a> for anyone to access not only during Black History Month, but throughout the year. <br />
<br />
From the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra to the historical records of Frederick Douglass and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., this collection includes 26 new institutions (50 overall) contributing <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/browse/?q.openId=8129907598665562501&amp;projectId=black-history-and-culture&amp;v.filter=items"">5,000+ items</a> and more than <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/browse/?q.openId=8129907598665562501&amp;projectId=black-history-and-culture&amp;v.filter=exhibits"">80 curated exhibits</a>.

Collecting these works into one place provides unprecedented access to a vital part of history that is too often forgotten. By comparing works of art and texts of speeches to find commonalities and distinctions, we can also build on the past to inspire ourselves and others. And while today is the first day of Black History Month, the work of remembering our history is necessary year round—which is why these records will be there on the Cultural Institute for generations to come.<br />

4335412002226383829,,Google Blogs,2016-01-27T10:01:00-08:00,AlphaGo: using machine learning to master the ancient game of Go,"The game of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)"">Go</a> originated in China more than 2,500 years ago. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius"">Confucius</a> wrote about the game, and it is considered one of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_arts"">four essential arts</a> required of any true Chinese scholar. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGmbwqqUNs"">Played by more than 40 million people worldwide</a>, the rules of the game are simple: Players take turns to place black or white stones on a board, trying to capture the opponent's stones or surround empty space to make points of territory. The game is played primarily through intuition and feel, and because of its beauty, subtlety and intellectual depth it has captured the human imagination for centuries.<br />
<br />
But as simple as the rules are, Go is a game of profound complexity. There are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible positions—that’s more than the number of atoms in the universe, and more than a googol times larger than chess.<br />
<br />
This complexity is what makes Go hard for computers to play, and therefore an irresistible challenge to artificial intelligence (AI) researchers, who use games as a testing ground to invent smart, flexible algorithms that can tackle problems, sometimes in ways similar to humans. The first game mastered by a computer was <a href=""http://www.pong-story.com/1952.htm"">noughts and crosses</a> (also known as tic-tac-toe) in 1952. Then fell <a href=""https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewFile/1208/1109"">checkers</a> in 1994. In 1997 Deep Blue famously beat Garry Kasparov at <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370201001291/pdf?md5=a843a5b1c9049457e0d3adb68117b4ed&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S0004370201001291-main.pdf"">chess</a>. It’s not limited to board games either—IBM's <a href=""https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/download/2303/2165"">Watson</a>&nbsp;[PDF] bested two champions at Jeopardy in 2011, and <a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/02/from-pixels-to-actions-human-level.html"">in 2014 our own algorithms learned to play dozens of Atari games</a> just from the <a href=""https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-data/assets/papers/DeepMindNature14236Paper.pdf"">raw pixel inputs</a>. But to date, Go has thwarted AI researchers; computers still only play Go as well as amateurs. <br />
<br />
Traditional AI methods—which construct a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_tree"">search tree</a> over all possible positions—don’t have a chance in Go. So when we set out to crack Go, we took a different approach. We built a system, AlphaGo, that combines an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search"">advanced tree search</a> with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning#Deep_neural_networks"">deep neural networks</a>. These neural networks take a description of the Go board as an input and process it through 12 different network layers containing millions of neuron-like connections.  One neural network, the “policy network,” selects the next move to play. The other neural network, the “value network,” predicts the winner of the game. <br />
<br />
We trained the neural networks on 30 million moves from games played by human experts, until it could predict the human move 57 percent of the time (the previous record before AlphaGo was <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.3409"">44 percent</a>). But our goal is to beat the best human players, not just mimic them. To do this, AlphaGo learned to discover new strategies for itself, by playing thousands of games between its neural networks, and adjusting the connections using a trial-and-error process known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning"">reinforcement learning</a>. Of course, all of this requires a huge amount of computing power, so we made extensive use of <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/"">Google Cloud Platform</a>.<br />
<br />
After all that training it was time to put AlphaGo to the test. First, we held a tournament between AlphaGo and the other top programs at the forefront of computer Go. AlphaGo won all but one of its 500 games against these programs. So the next step was to invite the reigning three-time European Go champion Fan Hui—an elite professional player who has devoted his life to Go since the age of 12—to our London office for a challenge match. In a closed-doors match last October, AlphaGo won by 5 games to 0. It was the first time a computer program has ever beaten a professional Go player. You can find out more in our paper, which was published in <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7587/full/nature16961.html"">Nature</a> today. <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/SUbqykXVx0A"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
What’s next? In March, AlphaGo will face its ultimate challenge: a five-game challenge match in Seoul against the legendary <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Se-dol"">Lee Sedol</a>—the top Go player in the world over the past decade. <br />
<br />
We are thrilled to have mastered Go and thus achieved one of the <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/05/the-world-of-computer-go/"">grand challenges of AI</a>. However, the most significant aspect of all this for us is that AlphaGo isn’t just an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system"">“expert” system</a> built with hand-crafted rules; instead it uses general machine learning techniques to figure out for itself how to win at Go. While games are the perfect platform for developing and testing AI algorithms quickly and efficiently, ultimately we want to apply these techniques to important real-world problems. Because the methods we’ve used are general-purpose, our hope is that one day they could be extended to help us address some of society’s toughest and most pressing problems, from climate modelling to complex disease analysis. We’re excited to see what we can use this technology to tackle next!<br />

6986215603708984386,,Google Blogs,2016-01-26T08:30:00-08:00,New ways to stay informed about presidential politics,"In just two days, Americans will tune in for the final Republican debate before the 2016 primary season officially kicks off in Iowa, and we’re <a href=""http://googlepolitics.blogspot.com/2016/01/google-and-fox-news-channel-present.html"">teaming up with Fox News Channel</a> to make sure every citizen can get the most out of it. To help people get informed before heading to the polls, we’re integrating three new components into the debate: a way to hear directly from candidates on Google; real-time Google Trends data; and questions from some of YouTube’s most prominent voices. <br />
<br />
<b>Hear from candidates directly, right on Google</b><br />
Political search interest spikes 440 percent on average during live televised debates as people turn to the web to learn more about the candidates and their platforms. Now people will have a new way to hear directly from candidates themselves, in real-time—right in Google Search results. This experimental feature helps voters make more informed choices, and levels the playing field for candidates to share ideas and positions on issues they may not have had a chance to address during the debate. By publishing long-form text, photos and videos throughout the debate, campaigns can now give extended responses, answer questions they didn’t get a chance to on stage, and rebut their opponents. As soon as the first debate begins at 7 p.m. ET on Thursday, search “Fox News debate” to find campaign responses.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2u2MdgCeRfo/VqedCWwwmHI/AAAAAAAARyQ/AKX7cLGJQzU/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""348"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2u2MdgCeRfo/VqedCWwwmHI/AAAAAAAARyQ/AKX7cLGJQzU/s640/pasted%2Bimage%2B0.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><b>Dig into issues with Google Trends </b><br />
Throughout the debate, we’ll also spotlight key insights from <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_5NL_ZVIBAABJNM_en"">Google Trends</a> that offer interesting insights about the candidates, issues, and debate topics—anything from <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/689446079436234752?lang=en"">questions asked about key issues</a> to <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/689791891555115008?lang=en"">trending terms</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/687867238708285440?lang=en"">rankings</a> like the below minute-by-minute view of which candidate was searched most during the last debate.  <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Hl8yhanW8gA/VqedCgntrYI/AAAAAAAARyM/PzzYfM-6q7E/s1600/2016-01-25.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Hl8yhanW8gA/VqedCgntrYI/AAAAAAAARyM/PzzYfM-6q7E/s1600/2016-01-25.gif"" /></a></div>You’ll also be able to answer polling questions about the issues that matter to you directly on Google Search when you search “Fox News debate.” Fox News will cover responses to these questions on air after the debate. <br />
<br />
<b>Watch YouTube creators engage with the candidates</b><br />
Finally, three prominent YouTube creators—<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/NabelaNoor"">Nabela Noor</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/SoldierKnowsBest"">Mark Watson</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/dulcecandy"">Dulce Candy</a>—will join the moderators in the debate to ask the candidates a question on an issue that matters to them and their communities. Bringing new voices from YouTube to political debates is something we’ve been doing since the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pw-oPjSeb4"">2008 election</a>, and it can lead to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuRLwReqTxw"">personal</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHl1aGyPm5s"">powerful</a> interactions between candidates and voters.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/EjPzcPJ-8hg"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
The debate begins at 7 p.m. ET on Thursday, with the prime time debate starting at 9 p.m. ET. So tune in to Fox News Channel to learn more about your presidential candidates on Google!<br />

5136351009141275169,,Google Blogs,2016-01-25T05:00:00-08:00,Helping refugees access education and information ,"Ahmed is an economics student from Aleppo in Syria. Last year he was forced to leave his hometown because of the war that has forced millions of his compatriots out of their country. He left his family and his studies—everything—behind to find a better future in Europe. Now safe in Berlin, his dream is to continue his studies and eventually become a teacher at a university in Germany.   <br />
<br />
As they make it through a dangerous journey, the first thing refugees need is to find shelter, food and access to care. But soon enough, they have to learn the local language, acquire skills to work in a new country, and figure out a way to continue their studies—all in an effort to reclaim and reconnect with the lives they had before. <br />
<br />
Last fall, we <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/update-response-refugee-migrants.html"">shared</a> how we’re supporting organizations on the frontline of providing essential humanitarian relief support. But we also wanted to do something to help with refugees’ long-term challenges, such as the need for access to information and education. So today, we’re making a $5.3 million Google.org grant to support the launch of Project Reconnect, a program by <a href=""http://www.nethope.org/"">NetHope</a> to equip nonprofits working with refugees in Germany with Chromebooks, in order to facilitate easier access to education for refugees like Ahmed. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KrDwSP4AfEM/VqXHD7E_oqI/AAAAAAAARxs/0CwvX0e0eX8/s1600/reconnect.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""400"" src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KrDwSP4AfEM/VqXHD7E_oqI/AAAAAAAARxs/0CwvX0e0eX8/s400/reconnect.png"" width=""400"" /></a></div>Chromebooks have proven to be a good fit for education purposes. They can be easily set up to run education or language learning apps. They’re automatically kept up to date with the latest features, apps and virus protection. And they can be configured and managed by a central administrator (in this case the nonprofits) to offer relevant programs, content and materials depending on the situation. For example, they can run an educational game for children, a language course for younger adults or even feature information about the asylum application process on a pre-installed homepage. <br />
<br />
Nonprofits can apply today on <a href=""http://reconnect.nethope.org/"">this website</a>. Many organizations and their staff are doing incredible work in very difficult circumstances to help with this crisis. We hope that by supporting these nonprofits, we can help people like Ahmed on the next step of their journey.<br />

When ads are good, they connect you to products or services you’re interested in and make it easier to get stuff you want. They also keep a lot of what you love about the web—like news sites or mobile apps—free.<br />
<br />
But some ads are just plain bad—like ads that carry malware, cover up content you’re trying to see, or promote fake goods. Bad ads can ruin your entire online experience, a problem we take very seriously. That’s why we have a strict set of <a href=""https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/6008942?hl=en"">policies</a> for the kinds of ads businesses can run with Google—and why we’ve invested in sophisticated technology and a global team of 1,000+ people dedicated to fighting bad ads. Last year alone we disabled more than 780 million ads for violating our policies—a number that's increased over the years thanks to new protections we've put in place. If you spent one second looking at each of these ads, it’d take you nearly 25 years to see them all!<br />
<br />
Here are some of the top areas we focused on in our fight against bad ads in 2015:<br />
<br />
<b>Busting bad ads</b><br />
Some bad ads, like those for products that falsely claim to help with weight loss, mislead people. Others help fraudsters carry out scams, like those that lead to “phishing” sites that trick people into handing over personal information. Through a combination of computer algorithms and people at Google reviewing ads, we’re able to block the vast majority of these bad ads before they ever get shown. Here are some types of bad ads we busted in 2015:<br />

<b><span style=""font-size: small;"">Counterfeiters</span></b><br />
<span style=""font-size: small;"">We suspended more than 10,000 sites and 18,000 accounts for attempting to sell counterfeit goods (like imitation designer watches). </span><br />
<span style=""font-size: small;""><br />
</span> <b><span style=""font-size: small;"">Pharmaceuticals</span></b><br />
<span style=""font-size: small;"">We blocked more than 12.5 million ads that violated our healthcare and medicines policy, such as ads for pharmaceuticals that weren’t approved for use or that made misleading claims to be as effective as prescription drugs. </span><br />
<span style=""font-size: small;""><br />
</span> <b><span style=""font-size: small;"">Weight loss scams</span></b><br />
<span style=""font-size: small;"">Weight loss scams, like ads for supplements promising impossible-to-achieve weight loss without diet or exercise, were one of the top user complaints in 2015. We responded by suspending more than 30,000 sites for misleading claims.</span><br />
<span style=""font-size: small;""><br />
</span> <b><span style=""font-size: small;"">Phishing</span></b><br />
<span style=""font-size: small;"">In 2015, we stepped up our efforts to fight <a href=""https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/106318?hl=en"">phishing sites</a>, blocking nearly 7,000 sites as a result.</span><br />
<b><span style=""font-size: small;""><br />
</span></b> <b><span style=""font-size: small;"">Unwanted software</span></b><br />
<span style=""font-size: small;"">Unwanted software can slow your devices down or unexpectedly change your homepage and keep you from changing it back. With powerful new protections, we disabled more than 10,000 sites offering <a href=""https://www.google.com/about/company/unwanted-software-policy.html"">unwanted software</a>, and reduced unwanted downloads via Google ads by more than 99 percent.</span><br />

<b><span style=""font-size: small;"">Trick to click</span></b><br />
<span style=""font-size: small;"">We got even tougher on ads that mislead or trick people into interacting with them—like ads designed to look like system warnings from your computer. In 2015 alone we rejected more than 17 million.</span><br />

<b>Creating a better experience</b><br />
Sometimes even ads that offer helpful and relevant information behave in ways that can be really annoying—covering up what you’re trying to see or sending you to an advertiser’s site when you didn’t intend to go there. In 2015, we disabled or banned the worst offenders. <br />

You’re swiping through a slideshow of the best moments from the Presidential debate when an ad redirects you even though you didn’t mean to click on it. We’re working to end that. We've developed technology to determine when clicks on mobile ads are accidental. Instead of sending you off to an advertiser page you didn't mean to visit, we let you continue enjoying your slideshow (and the advertiser doesn't get charged).</span><br />
<span style=""font-size: small;""><br />
</span> <b><span style=""font-size: small;"">Bad sites and apps</span></b><br />
<span style=""font-size: small;"">In 2015, we stopped showing ads on more than 25,000 mobile apps because the developers didn’t follow our policies. More than two-thirds of these violations were for practices like mobile ads placed very close to buttons, causing someone to accidentally click the ad. There are also some sites and apps that we choose not to work with because they don’t follow our policies. We also reject applications from sites and mobile apps that want to show Google ads but don't follow our policies. In 2015 alone, we rejected more than 1.4 million applications.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Putting you in control</b><br />
We also give you tools to control the type of ads you see. You can always <a href=""https://support.google.com/adwords/troubleshooter/4578507?rd=1"">let us know</a> when you believe an ad might be violating our policies.<br />
<br />
<b><span style=""font-size: small;"">Mute This Ad</span></b><br />
<span style=""font-size: small;"">Maybe you’ve just seen way too many car ads recently. “<a href=""https://privacy.google.com/about-ads.html?utm_source=ogb-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-pr&amp;utm_campaign=better-ads-blog#take-control-of-your-google-ads-experience"">Mute This Ad</a>” lets you click an “X” at the top on many of the ads we show and Google will stop showing you that ad and others like it from that advertiser. You can also tell us why. The 4+ billion pieces of feedback we received in 2015 are helping us show better ads and shape our policies.</span><br />

<b>Looking ahead to 2016</b><br />
We’re always updating our technology and our policies based on your feedback—and working to stay one step ahead of the fraudsters.

One of Europe’s highest peaks, the wild terrain of the famed mountain range is reserved for ardent mountaineers and intrepid explorers. Starting today in Google Maps, you can get an up-close, 360-degree look at the breathtaking beauty of Mont Blanc. Following last year’s first-ever vertical imagery collection of El Capitan in California’s <a href=""http://g.co/Yosemite"" target=""_blank"">Yosemite National Park</a>, we partnered with world-renowned alpine photographers, skiers, mountaineers, climbers, and runners to collect Street View of Western Europe’s highest peak. <br />

Look at Van Gogh—a Dutchman who spent much of his life in France, and was inspired not only by his contemporaries but also by Japanese artists like <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/u/0/compare/?item1=rwGc5ZWvzXZ0vA&amp;item2=QAFL1JRk6OKiNQ&amp;projectId=art-project"">Hiroshige</a>. But until recently, the act of enjoying art and culture was limited by geography. Unless you could visit a museum in person, it would be hard for you to appreciate a work, brushstroke by brushstroke. And to fully understand the legacy of someone like Van Gogh, you would have to go from Amsterdam to Chicago to New York to Tokyo to discover and marvel at all of his influences, works and successors.<br />

Tomorrow evening, President Obama will deliver his final State of the Union address to Congress, which will broadcast <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/whitehouse"">live on YouTube</a>. Then, as he has every year after the speech, he’ll turn to YouTube and Google to take questions from Americans about the issues that matter to them.<br />

They’ll join the President in the East Room of the White House, asking a selection of questions that are top of mind for them and their fans. You can watch the whole thing on the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/whitehouse"">White House YouTube channel</a>—and if you have a question for the President, suggest it by using the hashtag #YouTubeAsksObama on social media.<br />

And don’t forget to tune in on January 12 at 9 p.m. EST to watch the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/whitehouse"">State of the Union address live</a>, as well as the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/speakerryan"">Republican response</a>, live on YouTube.<br />

He investigates, but can’t seem to catch even a glimpse of the troublemaker. And so the chase goes... room to room… up and down… The stranger remains just out of sight, leaving behind only a trail of gifts…<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you’re following the action at your own pace, from whatever angle you please—behind you, to your left, to your right, or in front of you. All on your mobile phone. <br />
<br />
Today we’re bringing <a href=""https://www.google.com/atap/spotlight-stories/"">Google Spotlight Stories</a> to YouTube with “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiDRZfeL_hc&amp;feature=youtu.be"">Special Delivery</a>,” an original short film made by Academy Award-winning animation studio <a href=""http://www.aardman.com/"">Aardman Animations</a> (Wallace and Gromit fans, take note), viewable on the YouTube app on <a href=""https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6261925?p%3Dgooglespotlightstories-faq"">many Android devices</a>.<br />

With Google Spotlight Stories, your phone becomes a window to a story happening all around you. The sensors on your phone allow the story to be interactive, so when you move your phone to various scenes, you unlock mini-stories within the story.<br />
<br />
We didn’t want anyone to miss Aardman’s “Pink Panther”-style holiday caper! So we also made a YouTube 360 version for other Android devices, iOS devices, and the web. You can find both versions of “Special Delivery” on the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/gss"">Spotlight Stories YouTube channel</a>, and you can also watch with <a href=""http://google.com/cardboard"">Google Cardboard</a>. Next year, we’ll bring Google Spotlight Stories to more Android devices and the YouTube iOS app. <br />
<br />
You’ll want to watch “Special Delivery” a few times to find all the surprises within the story. In the full interactive experience, you’ll encounter 10 subplots, three potential ways to view the ending, and 60+ moments where you can decide to follow the story in different ways. Each viewing is unique. We don’t want to spoil the ending, so that’s all we’ll say for now…<br />

So you may have missed a few updates from around Google that can actually make your holiday season a little brighter (or at least make your to-do list go a little faster. Won’t make your sweater any less ugly, though). Here’s a look at what we’ve unwrapped recently:<br />
<br />
<b>Add this one to your to-do list: Reminders in Google Calendar</b><br />
Whether it’s “send holiday cards” or “use up FSA,” you can now add <a href=""http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2015/12/add-to-dos-to-your-google-calendar.html"">Reminders to Google Calendar</a> to help you complete your to-do list. These aren’t like those calendar entries you create yourself that you plain-old ignore completely and that then disappear. With Reminders, if you don’t complete the task and dismiss the Reminder, it’ll pop up on your calendar again the next day. And the next. And the … until you can’t take it anymore and just send those holiday cards already. You’ll thank us when your list is checked off. Twice.<br />

So if you get a text with your cousin’s flight number, you can tap and hold to see the flight’s status, then respond without having to juggle between searching and texting. If you ordered a gift online and want to know if it will make it down the chimney and under the tree on time, tap and hold your confirmation email to get tracking info. Consider it your own personal Santa’s Little Helper. <br />

6760326728873340606,,Google Blogs,2015-12-16T00:00:00-08:00,Search on: 2015 in Google Search,"From devastation to empowerment and tragedy to hope, our <a href=""http://google.com/2015"">15th annual Year in Search</a> uncovers the moments that captured the world’s hearts—and questions that revealed who we are. From “How can I help Nepal” to “How can the world find peace?” here’s a look back at 2015, through the lens of Google search.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7o7R5BgWDY"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
<b>Searching for ways to help</b><br />
Within two minutes of the deadly attack on Paris in November, the French capital was <a href=""http://googletrends.github.io/parisattacks/"">searching for information</a> on the assault underway in their city. Less than 10 minutes later, the rest of the world started searching. As of today, we’ve seen more than 897 million searches about the city as the world came together to “Pray for Paris.”<br />
<br />
Global showings of support and offerings of help were a key topic in search this year. Following the <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_nmOD1lABAABNNM_en"">Nepal earthquake</a>, “how can I help Nepal?” was a top global search. From Somerville, Mass. to Ludwigsberg, Germany, people asked how to volunteer and what to donate. <br />
<br />
<b>Searching for perspective</b><br />
While questions around Nepal were similar around the world, the <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_iQ-fCFEBAABHhM_en"">migrant crisis in Europe</a> spiked a wider variety of queries. From Italy asking “How to adopt a Syrian orphan child?” to Germany wondering “Where are the refugees coming from?” the world turned to Google to understand the situation and what it meant for them. <br />
<br />
In the U.S., the topic of <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_ZM8QflEBAAAlMM_en"">guns</a> brought varying questions. From Portland, Ore. to Austin, Texas, people across the country searched for “what is gun control,” “why do we need gun control,” “why won’t gun control work” and more to understand the issue. With more than 160 million searches, interest in gun control spiked higher than interest for gun shops—typically a more popular search—at multiple points in 2015.<br />
<br />
<b>Searching for acceptance</b><br />
In June, we met <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_QHmcc1EBAACNiM_en"">Caitlyn Jenner</a>, someone we’d both always known and were meeting for the first time. Across the globe, she was searched more than 344 million times, and her story helped give a new voice to the transgender community. <br />
<br />
People cheered&nbsp;“#lovewins”&nbsp;when the U.S. Supreme Court made a <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_If-NVFEBAAD9KM_en"">monumental ruling</a> that gay marriages should be recognized at both the State and Federal level. The reaction was instant, with search interest in both same-sex marriage and the Supreme Court reaching higher than at any time in Google's history.<br />
<br />
<b>Searching for… the dress, the Force and the singer</b><br />
Turning to the Search watercooler, the year began with the world divided over an <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_9wXO1FABAABpUM_en"">important question</a>: is it white and gold? or blue and black? Days of debate and 73 million searches later, “black and blue dress” topped searches of “white and gold dress,” and the matter was settled forever (right?).  <br />
<br />
And though “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is just hitting theaters this week, it’s already <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_mahWFlEBAACePM_en"">taken the Internet by storm</a>(trooper). The trailer alone garnered more than 155 million searches! But the all-time high for Google searches around “Star Wars” was in 2005 after “The Revenge of the Sith” came out in theaters—can we beat it this week?  <br />
<br />
Finally, what better way to close out the year than by saying “<a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_Z9VcflEBAABqKM_en"">Hello</a>”? With the debut of “25,” Adele broke records by the week, putting her album at the top of the charts and skyrocketing to the top of Google Search faster than any other musician this year. <br />
<br />
<b>Hundreds of stories in depth</b><br />
The 2015 Year in Search goes deeper than we've ever gone before. This year, we’re covering hundreds of news stories, sharing interactive guides and charts, and diving into the numbers by sharing things like how many times people searched for Adele (439 million, if you want to know!). <br />

But between the great shots your brother has buried on his iPhone and that friend who keeps forgetting to email you her pics, you're often left reliving the event through just the photos and videos you took yourself.<br />
<br />
Today we’re introducing shared albums in Google Photos—a fast and simple way to pool your photos and videos that makes it easier to bring everyone’s memories together. <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/taxad270uvQ"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
With the launch of Google Photos in May, we made it simpler to share images and albums by sending links over SMS, email, or messaging apps. With today’s launch, you can now make the albums you send collaborative. People receiving the shared album can join to add their own photos and videos, and also get notifications when new pics are added. You can even save photos and videos from a shared album to your Google Photos library, so that you can hold onto them even if you weren’t the one holding the camera.<br />
<br />
Best of all, there’s no setup—select photos, make an album and then send the link off to whomever you’d like. And it works no matter what device your friends and family are using—tablet or laptop, Android or iPhone. <br />
<br />
Shared albums is rolling out today on <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dogb"">Android</a>, <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id962194608?pt=9008&amp;ct=ogb&amp;mt=8"">iOS</a> and the <a href=""https://photos.google.com/"">web</a>. Time to create an album and revisit that holiday party from another angle!<br />

667695285627381934,,Google Blogs,2015-12-09T09:00:00-08:00,Google Demo Day: shining a light on female entrepreneurs,"Women around the world are creating and building incredible technology companies. We see this every day through our Google for Entrepreneurs programs—like <a href=""https://www.googleforentrepreneurs.com/startup-communities/40forward/"">#40Forward</a>, which works with organizations to increase the representation of female entrepreneurs in startup communities, and our baby-friendly startup school <a href=""https://www.googleforentrepreneurs.com/startup-communities/campus-for-moms/"">Campus for Moms</a>. Supporting these startups is important because teams with diverse perspectives and experiences—particularly in leadership positions—make better products for users. <br />
<br />
But the data still tells us that women-led startups often struggle to get access to top investors who can help them raise money. Despite women owning 29 percent of U.S. businesses, female-led companies receive <a href=""http://www.babson.edu/Academics/centers/blank-center/global-research/diana/Documents/diana-project-executive-summary-2014.pdf"">only 3 percent of venture capital</a>—a lifeline for many startups to fund new product development and hiring. <br />
<br />
With this in mind, today we're hosting our first Google Demo Day specifically for startups with female founders. More than 450 companies from 40+ countries applied, and we chose 11 female-led startups to join us in San Francisco for the event. These startups come from all over the world and span a variety of industries—from Kichink, a B2B e-commerce company in Mexico, to ChattingCat, a real-time translation service in South Korea. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eEx8bgGGe1I/Vmhcryv1YwI/AAAAAAAARkU/92ZGHjnC5Uc/s1600/IMG_6152.JPG"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""328"" src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eEx8bgGGe1I/Vmhcryv1YwI/AAAAAAAARkU/92ZGHjnC5Uc/s640/IMG_6152.JPG"" width=""640"" /></a></div>At today’s event, each startup will have four minutes to pitch their businesses, followed by Q&amp;A with a panel of judges. At the end of the day, the judges will crown a Judges’ Favorite, based on the strength of their business model, their team, and their product. Demo Days aren’t just a time to pitch investors; founders also receive mentoring and feedback from Googlers and Silicon Valley veterans through a series of talks and workshops.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--96rVcELnwE/Vmhcr_t8YSI/AAAAAAAARkQ/I1KdaRn0TSE/s1600/demoday2015_announce_Facebook%2B%25282%2529.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--96rVcELnwE/Vmhcr_t8YSI/AAAAAAAARkQ/I1KdaRn0TSE/s550/demoday2015_announce_Facebook%2B%25282%2529.png"" width=""550"" /></a></div>Companies from our past two Demo Days have raised $3.5 million from investors who are in attendance, and millions more afterwards. For example, Durham, North Carolina-based beverage entrepreneur Tatiana Birgisson, who won our Demo Day in April, has raised more than $1 million for her energy tea startup <a href=""http://www.matienergy.com/"">MATI Energy</a>.<br />
<br />
But it's not just the people in the room who can take part in the big day. You can tune in to the live stream on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87atcCjEqWI&amp;feature=youtu.be"">YouTube</a> at 10am PT today to see Demo Day in action. You'll also have the chance to vote for the winner of the ""Game Changer"" Award, an audience favorite trophy. We hope this Demo Day will not only shine a light on the participating startups, but on the exciting companies being built and led by female entrepreneurs everywhere. <br />

5068151132466400430,,Google Blogs,2015-12-08T10:05:00-08:00,"Meet the Pixel C, our take on the tablet","This holiday season, there's no shortage of electronics to choose from. When it comes to picking out what device to use, sometimes you want a laptop to hammer out a lengthy document. Other times you want a lightweight tablet to sit back and watch your favorite video. Starting today, you don't have to choose, because the Pixel C is available on the Google Store. As <a href=""https://youtu.be/Jc-LEG0T_4c?t=1h11m28s"">we previewed</a>  two months ago, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hrhyzIIyv0&amp;feature=youtu.be"">Pixel C</a> brings together the benefits of a full-size keyboard with the portability of a tablet so it can go wherever you go. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MSxFo36Ms9s/VmcZS04uGoI/AAAAAAAARjk/XXLJgtvRz2M/s1600/NexusRYUKey_O_SILVER_TQF.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MSxFo36Ms9s/VmcZS04uGoI/AAAAAAAARjk/XXLJgtvRz2M/s1600/NexusRYUKey_O_SILVER_TQF.png"" /></a></div>
The Pixel C’s high-resolution, 10.2” display is crisp, colorful, and bright—in fact it’s one of the brightest tablets out there—perfect for sharing photos and videos with family over the holidays. Graphics horsepower and stereo speakers mean the Pixel C can keep up with you whether you’re watching a new episode of ""Silicon Valley"" or playing a new game.<br />
<br />
But what really makes the Pixel C unique is the full-size keyboard, which is designed to fit perfectly with the tablet. It attaches seamlessly with magnets, and automatically connects via bluetooth. When the tablet and keyboard are closed together, the keyboard charges wirelessly and automatically—so you never have to worry about it running out of juice. And when you don’t need to type, the keyboard tucks securely behind the tablet with magnets—out of the way but close by for when you need it.<br />
<br />
This is the first tablet designed with <a href=""https://www.android.com/versions/marshmallow-6-0/"">Android 6.0, Marshmallow</a> in mind. You get added security benefits, smarter and longer battery life (10+ hours) and Now on Tap at your fingertips. To ensure the Pixel C gets even better over time, it will receive regular security and feature updates directly from Google. But what makes a tablet great is the amount of things you can do with it—and you’ve got plenty to choose from with s’more than 1 million apps on Google Play.  <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/iYxXmIOaf8w"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
The Pixel C is available on the <a href=""https://store.google.com/product/pixel_c"">Google Store</a> now starting at $499, and if you order today, you can get it in time for the holidays.<br />

2913246746419444281,,Google Blogs,2015-12-08T10:00:00-08:00,Make your home Internet look like your home with OnHub,"Chances are, somewhere in your home, there‘s a tangled mess of wires and blinking lights that make your Wi-Fi work. Your router likely isn’t the most sightly thing, and you probably hide it behind a curtain or under a bookcase—out of sight. <br />
<br />
Turns out, that’s a bit of a problem, since routers work better when they’re out in the open. So a few months ago, <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/meet-onhub-new-router-for-new-way-to-wi.html"">we released the first OnHub router from TP-LINK</a>. It replaces the unruly cords, blinking lights, and bulky antennas of a typical router with subtle lighting and internal wiring, so you’re more likely to put OnHub out where it works best. <br />
<br />
Today we’re introducing more ways to make your OnHub look great in your home with <a href=""https://store.google.com/product/shell_for_onhub_tplink"">three new, interchangeable shells</a> for the OnHub from TP-LINK, as well as <a href=""http://g.co/onhubmakers"">OnHub Makers</a>, a gallery of shells designed by artists, designers, and makers.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/J9tsNfv5hyY"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
With OnHub Makers, we wanted to see what some of the world’s most creative minds would do to personalize their routers. We reached out to artists, makers and designers who poured resin, blew glass, and cut paper to make their own unique shells. You can see their creations and learn more in the <a href=""http://g.co/onhubmakers"">OnHub Makers gallery</a>.<br />
<br />
Feeling inspired? Then it’s time to get crafty. We’ve put together all of the information you need to customize an OnHub shell. Whether you’re using a laser cutter or simple finger paints, download the <a href=""https://onhubmakers.withgoogle.com/downloads/OnHub_Makers_Packet.pdf"">Maker Packet</a> for 3D files, 2D patterns, and useful guidelines. Once you’re done, be sure to share your designs online using the hashtag <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=%23OnHubMakers&amp;src=typd"">#OnHubMakers</a>, and we may feature your design in <a href=""http://g.co/onhubmakers"">our gallery</a>. <br />
<br />
If DIY isn’t really your thing you can still add some style to your Wi-Fi with one of the three new shells from the OnHub team, available later today in the U.S. for $29-39 on the <a href=""https://store.google.com/product/shell_for_onhub_tplink"">Google Store</a>.<br />

3113798211140140788,,Google Blogs,2015-12-03T03:00:00-08:00,Powering the Internet with renewable energy,"Today we're announcing the largest, and most diverse, purchase of renewable energy ever made by a non-utility company. Google has already committed to purchase more renewable energy than any other company. Now, through a series of new wind and solar projects around the world, we’re one step closer to our commitment to <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/27/fact-sheet-white-house-launches-american-business-act-climate-pledge"">triple our purchases of renewable energy by 2025</a> and our goal of powering 100% of our operations with clean energy.  <br />
<br />
<b>842 MW of renewable energy around the world</b><br />
Today’s agreements will add an additional 842 megawatts of renewable energy capacity to power our data centers. Across three countries, we’re nearly doubling the amount of renewable energy we’ve purchased to date. We’re now up to 2 gigawatts—the equivalent to taking nearly 1 million cars off the road. <br />
<br />
These additional 842 megawatts represent a range of locations and technologies, from a wind farm in Sweden to a solar plant in Chile.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jWu24Mz8Hg4/Vl_via28GsI/AAAAAAAARhE/wVA1KMB8Nuc/s1600/gigawatts.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""609"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jWu24Mz8Hg4/Vl_via28GsI/AAAAAAAARhE/wVA1KMB8Nuc/s640/gigawatts.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div>
These long-term contracts range from 10-20 years and provide projects with the financial certainty and scale necessary to build these wind and solar facilities—thus bringing new renewable energy onto the grid in these regions. For our part, these contracts not only help minimize the environmental impact of our services—they also make good business sense by ensuring good prices.<br />
<br />
<b>Our commitment to a sustainable energy future</b><br />
Since we opened our <a href=""https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/the-dalles/"">very first owned data center</a> in 2006, we’ve been working to promote renewable and sustainable energy use in several ways:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>First, we’re building the world’s most efficient computer infrastructure by <a href=""https://www.google.com/green/efficiency/datacenters/"">designing our data centers</a> to use as little energy as possible.</li>
<li>Second, we're driving the renewables industry forward by fully committing to renewable sources. In 2010, we entered our first large-scale <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/reducing-our-carbon-footprint-with.html"">renewable power purchase agreement</a> with a wind farm in Iowa, and we subsequently <a href=""https://www.google.com/green/energy/use/#purchasing"">completed</a> a number of similar large-scale energy purchases over the past five years. Today’s announcement is another milestone in this area.</li>
<li>Third, we've worked with our utility partners to help promote transformation in the utility sector. In 2013 we <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/expanding-options-for-companies-to-buy.html"">created a new program</a> that enables customers like Google to buy large amounts of renewable energy directly from their utilities. Today's announcement includes the <a href=""http://googlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2015/11/buying-renewable-energy.html"">first solar project enrolled under that program</a>. And this past summer we announced that our newest data center will be on <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/06/a-power-plant-for-internet-our-newest.html"">located on the site of a retiring coal plant</a> and will be 100% renewable powered from day one.</li>
<li>Fourth, beyond our efforts to power our own operations with renewables, we’ve made separate agreements to <a href=""https://www.google.com/green/energy/investments/"">fund $2.5 billion</a> into 22 large-scale renewable energy projects over the last five years, from Germany to Kansas to Kenya. These investments have been in some of the largest and most transformative renewable energy projects in the world with a goal to help drive renewable energy development not only as a customer but as an investor, and bring down costs for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<br />
And we’re also working on new technologies and ideas—ranging from <a href=""https://www.google.com/get/sunroof"">Project Sunroof</a> to <a href=""http://www.google.com/makani/"">Makani Power</a> to <a href=""http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2015/11/street-view-gives-you-window-into.html?m=1"">air quality monitoring</a>—that we hope can make a cleaner energy future an option for many more people.<br />
<br />
With world leaders coming together at the <a href=""http://www.cop21paris.org/"">COP21 UN conference on climate change</a> in Paris this week, there's no better time to focus on renewable energy. We hope that our efforts play a small part in boosting all of us in the race to solve climate change. <br />

The Impact Challenge is a Google.org initiative to invest $20 million in nonprofits who are using technology to make the world more accessible for the 1 billion people living with disabilities. <br />
<br />
Today, as part of the program, we’re proud to celebrate the U.N. International Day of Persons with Disabilities with three new grants, totalling $2.95 million. Through our grants, the Royal London Society for Blind People will develop the <a href=""http://www.wayfindr.net/"">Wayfindr</a> project, helping visually impaired people navigate the London underground; Israeli NGO <a href=""http://en.beitissie.org.il/"">Issie Shapiro</a> will distribute Sesame, an app that allows people with mobility impairments to control a smartphone using only head movements; and, finally, German grantee Wheelmap will expand its accessibility mapping efforts worldwide. This week, many Googlers around the world will also <a href=""http://mapmyday.org/en"">join</a> Wheelmap’s Map My Day campaign to help out.<br />
<br />
We’ve also collected 11 <a href=""https://get.google.com/tips/#!?category=improve-access"">tips</a> that help people with disabilities get more out of their favorite Google products. (Why 11? It’s a play on “a11y”, tech-speak for “accessibility.”)<br />
<br />
Much of the accessibility work we do is driven by passionate Googlers from around the world. To give you a look at what motivates us to make Google, and the world, more inclusive, we asked four Googlers from our Disability Alliance to share more about what they’re working on:<br />

<b>Kiran Kaja, Technical Program Manager, London:&nbsp;</b>Being blind from birth, I’ve always been excited by devices that talk to you or allow you to talk back to them. Today, I work on Google’s Text to Speech team developing technologies that talk to people with disabilities. I’m also helping improve eyes-free voice actions on Android so that people with low vision can accomplish standard tasks just by talking to their phone. This not only helps people with disabilities, but anyone whose hands are busy with another task—like cooking, driving or caring for an infant. The advances we’re making in speech recognition and text to speech output promise a bright future for voice user interfaces.<br />

I started the Googler Disability Community, a group that works on changing Google’s physical environment and workplace systems to help make our company truly inclusive. Outside of my job, I enjoy exploring the beauty in disability through <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/aubrieality/"">photography</a> and poetry. My own disabilities and the way they influence my interactions with others provide endless inspiration for my art.<br />

8047230435529970206,,Google Blogs,2015-12-01T05:00:00-08:00,Join Google.org to help make education more inclusive for students with special needs,"<i>For the past month, Google.org has funded 750+ projects through the education crowdfunding site <a href=""http://donorschoose.org/"">DonorsChoose.org</a> to help teachers of students with special needs, as part of our <a href=""https://www.google.org/impactchallenge/disabilities/"">Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities</a>. Today we’re hearing from one teacher whose project was funded—Mr. Javier Payano, a music teacher at Lane Tech in Chicago.</i> -Ed.<br />
<br />
In two years of teaching students with special needs, I’ve learned how music can give students the opportunity to discover themselves. In our music inclusion choir, band and orchestra classes, students with disabilities make music with general education students, each at their own level of ability. I’ve seen music help even the most shy and reticent students socialize, smile and come out of their shells. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we don’t always have the right kinds of musical instruments to meet the diverse needs of every kid in my class. For classrooms like mine in Chicago, specialized equipment can truly open up the learning environment. From floor keyboards to rhythm instrument sets, I’m able to ensure that every student, no matter their mobility style, has a meaningful experience in my class.<br />

<i>Me and my students performing at a school assembly on November 10, 2015</i><br />
<br />
That’s why I was so thrilled to learn that Google.org <a href=""http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20151112/roscoe-village/google-picks-up-tab-for-all-cps-donors-choose-special-ed-projects"">was funding my request</a> on DonorsChoose.org to bring my <a href=""http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=1745513&amp;utm_source=dc&amp;utm_campaign=typ_cover&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Project&amp;pma=true"">music inclusion project</a> to more students. For the past month, Google.org has hosted schoolwide celebrations to honor teachers of students with special needs, and funded hundreds of DonorsChoose.org special needs projects like mine. Starting today for #GivingTuesday, Google is making it easier for everyone to support teachers by <a href=""http://google.org/impactchallenge/disabilities/donors-choose.html"">matching up to a million dollars</a> in donations to increase inclusion, equity and opportunity for students with diverse learning styles. In addition, last week <a href=""http://www.android.com/pay/give/"">Android Pay</a> committed to donating up to another $1 million to special needs projects on DonorsChoose.org.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/wL1zHf5fIAQ"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
There are currently 6.4 million students with special needs in the U.S.—13 percent of the total student population. Yet, a $17 billion federal <a href=""http://atlas.newamerica.org/individuals-disabilities-education-act-funding-distribution"">deficit in special education funding</a> leaves far too many gaps across classrooms. In fact, on average, all teachers <a href=""http://www.agile-ed.com/2015-teacher-out-of-pocket-spending"">spend $485 of their own money</a> each year on their classrooms. <br />
<br />
Teachers like me are working to make sure all students can have an equal and inclusive education. And you can help provide some of the materials they need most—<a href=""http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/search.html?subject7=-7"">take a look</a>!

Months of rehearsal to get the crescendos just right. Multiple stories of lights, rigging and machinery to set the scene.  At the world’s leading performing arts venues —like Carnegie Hall, the Berliner Philharmonie, the Bolshoi Theatre—artists, costume designers, musicians, stage crews and many more all come together to create the perfect moment on stage.<br />
<br />
And now you can join them. In a <a href=""http://g.co/performingarts"">new virtual exhibition</a> from the Google Cultural Institute and more than 60 performing arts organizations, you can experience dance, drama, music and opera alongside some of the world’s leading performers—onstage, backstage and with a 360 degree-view of the action. <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/E2RhaQgnQ3w"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
The new Performing Arts exhibition gives you a view that’s even closer than a front-row seat in the house. With 360-degree performance recordings, you you can choose a dancer’s-eye view of the crowd, or look down from the stage into the orchestra pit. At the Paris Opera, you can stand in the middle of the largest stage in Europe, surrounded by dancers performing choreographer Benjamin Millepied’s moves. Sit between the woodwinds and strings at <a href=""https://performingarts.withgoogle.com/en_us/performances/carnegie-hall"">Carnegie Hall</a> with a full view of Maestro Nézet-Séguin. Don’t worry if you’re underdressed as you tour the <a href=""https://performingarts.withgoogle.com/en/performances/berliner-philharmoniker"">Berliner Philharmoniker</a>’s rehearsal performance of Beethoven’s <i>Symphony No. 9</i> with conductor Sir Simon Rattle—you’ll see the orchestra is not in black tie either.<br />

If you’re lucky enough to be planning an in-person visit to one of these venues, you can tour them in Street View first to see where you’ll be sitting, or how the view is from the balcony.<br />

<b>Drones are now toys:&nbsp;</b>Drones are no longer expensive playthings for the tech-savvy.  Search for “toy drone” and you’ll find countless inexpensive, easy-to-use devices available from department stores and toy stores. And they’re popular—nationwide, shopping searches for drones are up 80% over the past year, and they’re highest in California.<br />
<br />
<b>Hoverboards are real, and they’re trending:</b> While we’re on the topic of electronic toys, hoverboards are so popular this year they’ve even overtaken searches for drones.

We just report them. -Ed.)<br />
<br />
<b>Your 90s wardrobe is BACK: </b>Bomber jackets. Levi jeans. Adidas Superstars. Looking at this year’s top-trending apparel list you’ll be forgiven for thinking we’ve gone back to the 90s.

As the day of gluttony and gratitude comes closer, people have been turning to Google to plan the big meal, get cooking tips and more. Here’s a look at some of the top Turkey Day searches—for more, see <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_PcHtFlEBAACBVM_en"">Google Trends</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>The reason for the season</b><br />
In the days leading up to Thanksgiving, people turn to Google to learn more about the origins of the holiday and its traditions, both new and old. Top questions include “Why did the pilgrims celebrate the first Thanksgiving?” and “What president made Thanksgiving a national holiday?”<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

<b>The other reason for the season</b><br />
Gratitude may be in the name, but food is the centerpiece of Thanksgiving. For weeks now people have been searching for recipes to wow their relatives this Thursday, from classics like cranberry relish and mashed potatoes to turkey alternatives like lasagna and beef stew. Here’s a look at the top recipes that trend every November:<br />

<b>How do I…?</b><br />
Even for people whose usual meal prep consists of shuffling through take-out menus, Thanksgiving is a time to roll up your sleeves and get to work in the kitchen. That—and the fact that a 20-lb poultry dish is a little harder to put on the table than, say, the ol’ blue box of mac and cheese—means it’s also a time when many turn to Google to brush up on some cooking tips. In the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, you’re asking all kinds of questions, from simple queries like “how to cook spaghetti squash“ and “how to boil eggs” to advanced topics like “what can I make ahead for thanksgiving?” and the very crucial, very daunting “How do you make turkey gravy?” <br />
<br />
<b>Let’s talk turkey</b><br />
The top Thanksgiving recipe question, however, is focused on the main dish: “How to cook a turkey?” Related questions include “how much turkey do you cook per person?” (Answer: there’s math involved but the most important part is making enough for sandwiches for multiple days after), followed quickly by “How long to cook a turkey?” (answer: more math). <br />
<br />
And though roasting is still the top trending technique method for cooking the big bird, enterprising (or efficiency-oriented) chefs across the U.S. are also searching for tips on how to smoke and deep-fry their turkeys. Proof that there’s more than one way to cook a turkey.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

Whether you’ll be slicing into pumpkin or pecan pie, eating your turkey smoked, turduckened or made of tofu, serving up fresh cranberry sauce or popping open a can—we hope you have a happy Thanksgiving!<br />

7802781139918553526,,Google Blogs,2015-11-23T07:00:00-08:00,Discover Jordan’s past and present in Google Maps,"<i>Starting today you can explore more than 30 historical sites throughout Jordan in Google Street View. To tell you more, read today’s guest blog post, by Her Majesty Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan. </i>-Ed.<br />
<br />
What a great day for Jordan and Jordanians! Thanks to Google Street View, we can now share the rich, proud and varied history of our country with anyone who has an Internet connection. With more than 30 historical sites available to explore virtually, people all over the world now have a window into our beautiful Kingdom in the heart of the Middle East.<br />
<br />
Throughout the ages, ancient civilizations have left their footprints in Jordan. Reminders of the Silk Road which linked the regions of the world in commerce. Ancient cities, such as the Romans’ Jerash and the Nabateans’ Petra. Significant religious sites, like Mount Nebo and the River Jordan. And, to this day, we continue to discover such footprints. <br />
<br />
With Google Street View, would-be visitors, or those just curious to learn more about our ancient lands, can explore Jordan’s unique historical heritage online. That’s one of the reasons I love this technology. Not only does it connect millions of people from all corners of the world, it provides a lens on the past. And when we understand more about each other’s stories and cultures and histories, we realize that we are more alike than we are different. That’s why we must preserve these treasures for future generations. They’re a doorway to our shared narrative.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yXdYec1Z8PQ"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
To this day, after too many trips to count, Jordan’s ancient archeological site, the Rose-Red city of Petra, still fills me with awe. Concealed in majestic mountain gorges, visitors can wander through <a href=""https://g.co/petra"">the entire city of Petra</a>, imagining what life was like in the thriving trading center and capital of the Nabataean kingdom. Carved by hand into vibrant red, white and pink sandstone cliffs, it has, miraculously, survived earthquakes to withstand the test of time. Film buffs might recognize it from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade when Harrison Ford and Sean Connery joined forces in their quest to find the Holy Grail. Now, you can step back in time and take a narrated tour of this hidden gem, exploring the tombs, sites and amphitheater that span an area the size of lower Manhattan.<br />

8788261246975243176,,Google Blogs,2015-11-23T00:16:00-08:00,"For <i>Star Wars</i> fans, old and new","The first memory I have of watching a movie is with my dad. I was around four years old, and one afternoon he fired up our bulky, '80s-style front-projection TV and the Betamax, and popped in <i>Star Wars</i>. Of course, it was *amazing*, and I've watched the original trilogy a dozen times since.<br />
<br />
It probably isn't a surprise that there are tons of <i>Star Wars</i> fans like me here at Google. You can regularly spot <a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2KZdFp8jJd4/VlJ0UH6XFqI/AAAAAAAARbg/qM1jsEiL0x8/s1600/Googler_Darth_Vader.jpg"">Darth Vaders</a>, dogs dressed like <a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MwYBGytNDd0/VlJ0Xth7KJI/AAAAAAAARbo/ZRexvQm8FbA/s1600/Googler_YodaDog.png"">Yoda</a>, and even the occasional <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@35.898186,-81.5481844,3a,75y,307.73h,90.35t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sqlcZPzXMS12y_CrDh64Qvw!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656"">stormtrooper</a>, roaming the halls of our data centers (probably still looking for those droids). So when we first heard about <i>Episode VII</i>, we started thinking about what a Google tribute to these epic stories might look like: “Wouldn't it be cool if there was some sort of<i> Star Wars</i> thingy in Search? The Millennium Falcon in Cardboard would be sweet! What if Google Translate could decipher galactic languages?""... and on, and on, and on. As this list of ideas grew, so too did the band of passionate engineers and product folks who wanted to build them.<br />
<br />
We reached out to our friends at Lucasfilm and Disney, and since then we’ve been working together on  building <a href=""http://google.com/starwars"">google.com/starwars</a>. It's a place for fans, by fans, and starting today you can choose the light or the dark side, and then watch your favorite Google apps like Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome and many more transform to reflect your path. And that's just the beginning. We've got more coming between now and opening night—the Millennium Falcon in all its (virtual reality) glory included, so stay tuned. And we've hidden a few easter eggs, too. So awaken the Force within, and be on the lookout for things from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…<br />

<br />
Since we <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/07/everything-in-its-right-place.html"">last posted</a>, we’ve spent a lot of time listening to what people using Google+ had to say. There were two features they kept coming back to: <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+googleplus/posts/HGGrZbWW9gV"">Communities</a>, which now average 1.2 million new joins per day, and <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+googleplus/posts/7ZpGWeou2sV"">Collections</a>, which launched just five months ago and is growing even faster. Whether it’s the <a href=""https://plus.google.com/communities/100656923780841493539?hl=en"">Nonfiction Addiction</a> Community, where people can be found discussing the best in Crime or Travel storytelling, or the <a href=""https://plus.google.com/collection/EX-8V"">Watch Project</a> Collection, where more than 40,000 people are following an antique watch hobbyist, these are the places on Google+ where people around the world are spending their time discovering and sharing things they love.<br />
<br />
And so we’ve reimagined Google+ to help them do that. Today, we’re starting to introduce a fully redesigned Google+ that puts Communities and Collections front and center. Now focused around interests, the new Google+ is much simpler. And it’s more mobile-friendly—we’ve rebuilt it across web, Android and iOS so that you’ll have a fast and consistent experience whether you are on a big screen or small one. You’ll need to opt-in to this new version of Google+ on the web to see the changes—check out <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+LukeWroblewski/posts/jJvNS3mwxyv"">our Google+ post</a>&nbsp;for more on how to give it a try.<br />

Creating great products that solve real needs and make life easier for people is something Google is always striving for. Your feedback got us this far—as we continue to refine Google+, we’d love to keep hearing from you. In the meantime, we look forward to seeing how today’s changes help kickstart even more conversations around everything from <a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/0/collection/kp_1P"">Zombie Cats</a> to <a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/0/collection/wOpZX"">Vintage Calculators</a>.<br />

Next week, tens of millions of us will hit the roads, consume millions of pounds of turkey, and then spend billions on Black Friday deals. Google Maps looked at Thanksgiving trends from the last three years to uncover the most useful information to make your holiday plans go a little bit easier. Whether you’re traveling, doing some last-minute grocery shopping, or Black Friday deal-dashing, here’s our day-by-day guide to braving the holiday crowds. <br />

<br />
<b>Tuesday:</b> No travel day leading up to the holiday is going to be a breeze, but if you can, start driving Tuesday rather than Wednesday. Yes, it’s still the second-worst travel day of the week, but according to Google Maps searches, for the last three years Wednesday has been the worst travel day—with the exceptions of Boston (Tuesday), and Honolulu, Providence and San Francisco (all Saturday). <br />
<br />

<br />
<b>Wednesday:</b> Americans are pretty predictable when it comes to the holidays: for the third year in a row, “ham shop” was the #1 trending destination search on Google Maps the day before Thanksgiving. Whether you’re running out to a ham shop, pie shop (#2), or liquor store (#3), make sure you don’t head all the way there just to find it closed. This year Google Maps and Google Search have added <a href=""http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2015/11/tis-season-google-brings-holiday-hours_6.html"">holiday hours</a>, so when you search for a business, you’ll see its updated holiday schedule. <br />

<br />
<b>Thanksgiving Day:</b> Maybe folks were put off by the trauma of last year’s burnt turkey? Nationwide, “buffet restaurants” were the #1 trending Google Maps term on Thanksgiving Day. But locally, folks were heading in other directions. In Houston, “doughnut shops” were trending on Thanksgiving. It was “bars” in Chicago— maybe people needed a break from their families.  And Miami residents were interested in looking their holiday best—”beauty salons” were among the trending searches by the South Beach crowd.<br />

<b>Black Friday:</b> The top Black Friday Google Maps trends nationwide were predictably of the “electronics store” and “outlet mall” variety—with “Christmas tree farms” not far behind as people looked ahead. Digging into local trends, however, things get more surprising. New Yorkers were on the hunt for tattoo shops, among other things, Angelenos for hookah bars, and people in Detroit spent their Black Friday on the lookout for hamburgers. Whether you’re in the market for a Christmas tree tat or shopping deals, here’s a tip: use the <a href=""http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2014/07/spend-more-time-exploring-with-google.html"">Explore</a> feature on Google Maps to discover the stores, restaurants and local entertainment around you. <br />
<br />
<b>The weekend:</b> Traffic patterns show that you’re better off driving home from a long weekend on Sunday rather than Saturday—traffic can be up to 40% worse on Saturday. And Google Maps will be with you all the way home, helping you check out <a href=""http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2015/10/google-maps-making-stressful-times.html"">gas prices and add detours</a> to your route, without having to exit out of navigation.<br />

I retired in 2012 after a 25-year career in the military, and this week with Google.org, I helped bring veterans with disabilities, and those otherwise unable to travel, their first virtual reality experience. On Thursday morning, we filmed the NYC Veteran’s Day Parade in 360-degree video, and with <a href=""http://google.com/cardboard"">Google Cardboard</a>, brought together veterans and their families at VA hospitals from <a href=""http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/tech/tech-companies-use-tools-of-trade-to-help-veterans-346307242.html"">Palo Alto, California</a>, to <a href=""http://www.newson6.com/story/30496907/oklahoma-veterans-get-virtual-look-at-new-york-city-parade"">Pryor, Oklahoma</a> to experience the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/nyregion/new-york-todayhonoring-veterans.html"">nation's largest Veterans Day parade</a> in virtual reality as if they were there, marching. These #UnitedWeMarch <a href=""https://www.google.org/impactchallenge/disabilities/veterans.html"">events</a> will continue over the next few days, at VA hospitals around the country.<br />

It was incredible to reconnect with other veterans and even better to see their reactions to the virtual parade. One Marine who served in Vietnam even remarked, ""You just took me away from this hospital room to New York. And you didn't even charge me airfare!""<br />

#UnitedWeMarch is part of the Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities, which has given $20M in grants from <a href=""http://google.org/"">Google.org</a> toward organizations improving the lives of people with disabilities. In honor of disabled veterans, Google.org also gave a $235,000 grant to <a href=""https://americamakes.us/"">America Makes</a> to create a training for military veterans to learn the basics of using new technologies to build personalized assistive devices like 3D-printed prosthetic limbs. This is all in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs Center for Innovation.<br />
<br />
I’m so grateful to have been there yesterday, seeing the veterans temporarily escape their hospital beds through virtual reality and experience the crowds cheering them along the parade route.  We'll continue these virtual marches tomorrow and into next week, so that every veteran has the chance to be celebrated.&nbsp; <br />

That means that quick and easy access to information is still not possible for a majority of the population. This is a huge problem, especially as people attempt to navigate and explore the world around them, so Google Maps is taking steps to help people across the globe find directions and get where they’re going, even when they don’t have an Internet connection. <br />
<br />
Now you can download an area of the world to your phone, and the next time you find there’s no connectivity—whether it’s a country road or an underground parking garage—Google Maps will continue to work seamlessly. Whereas before you could simply view an area of the map offline, now you can get turn-by-turn driving directions, search for specific destinations, and find useful information about places, like hours of operation, contact information or ratings.<br />

You can download an area by searching for a city, county or country, for instance, and tapping ""Download"" on the resulting place sheet, or by going to ""Offline Areas"" in the Google Maps menu and tapping on the “+” button. Once downloaded, Google Maps will move into offline mode automatically when it recognizes you’re in a location with spotty service or no connectivity at all. When a connection is found, it will switch back online so you can easily access the full version of Maps, including live traffic conditions for your current route. By default, we’ll only download areas to your device when you are on a Wi-Fi connection to prevent large data fees.<br />

Our apps just weren’t smart enough. But in a short amount of time they've gotten much, much smarter. Now, thanks to machine learning, you can do all those things pretty easily, and a lot more. But even with all the progress we've made with machine learning, it could still work much better. <br />
<br />
<div>
So we’ve built an entirely new machine learning system, which we call “<a href=""http://tensorflow.org/"">TensorFlow</a>.” TensorFlow is faster, smarter, and more flexible than our old system, so it can be adapted much more easily to new products and research. It’s a highly scalable machine learning system—it can run on a single smartphone or across thousands of computers in datacenters. We use TensorFlow for everything from speech recognition in the Google app, to <a href=""http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2015/11/computer-respond-to-this-email.html"">Smart Reply</a> in Inbox, to search in Google Photos. It allows us to build and train neural nets up to five times faster than our first-generation system, so we can use it to improve our products much more quickly.<br />

<tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;""><br /></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<br />
We've seen firsthand what TensorFlow can do, and we think it could make an even bigger impact outside Google. So today we’re also <a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/11/tensorflow-googles-latest-machine_9.html"">open-sourcing TensorFlow</a>. We hope this will let the machine learning community—everyone from academic researchers, to engineers, to hobbyists—exchange ideas much more quickly, through working code rather than just research papers. And that, in turn, will accelerate research on machine learning, in the end making technology work better for everyone. Bonus: TensorFlow is for more than just machine learning. It may be useful wherever researchers are trying to make sense of very complex data—everything from protein folding to crunching astronomy data.<br />
<br />
Machine learning is still in its infancy—computers today still can’t do what a 4-year-old can do effortlessly, like knowing the name of a dinosaur after seeing only a couple examples, or understanding that “I saw the Grand Canyon flying to Chicago” doesn’t mean the canyon is hurtling over the city. We have a lot of work ahead of us. But with TensorFlow we’ve got a good start, and we can all be in it together.<br />

When the story involves a 1940s Hollywood star-turned-inventor who helped develop technologies we all use with our smartphones today … well, we just have to share it with the world. <br />
<br />
<a href=""https://g.co/doodle/pzx7av"">Today on Google’s homepage</a> we’re celebrating Hedy Lamarr, the Austrian-born actress  Hollywood once dubbed “the most beautiful woman in the world.”  Lamarr’s own story reads like a movie script: bored by the film industry and feeling typecast,  Lamarr was more interested in helping the Allied war effort as World War II broke out than in the roles she was being offered.  She had some background in military munitions (yes, really), and together with a composer friend, George Antheil, used the principles of how pianos worked (yep, pianos) to identify a way to prevent German submarines from jamming Ally radio signals. The patent for “frequency hopping” Lamarr co-authored laid the groundwork for widely-used technologies like Bluetooth, GPS and wifi that we rely upon daily. <br />
<br />
It’s no wonder, then, that Lamarr has kind of a mythical status at Google, and I was pretty excited at the chance to tell her story in Doodle form. This took some tinkering of my own—after deciding on the movie format as a nod to her Hollywood career, I dug through old fashion illustrations and movie posters to try to capture the look and feel of the 1940s. Sketching storyboards on a yellow notepad helped me figure out how to show Lamarr in very different scenarios—movie star by day, inventor by night—which we then animated and set to the awesome soundtrack created by composer Adam Ever-Hadani.<br />
<br />
So in the spirit of celebrating women in technology everywhere, here’s to Hedy Lamarr, who fused the arts with science and never let herself be typecast. Happy birthday, Hedy, on what would have been your 101st birthday. And thank you.<br />

Despite earning the majority of bachelor's degrees in the U.S., women earn fewer than 20 percent of computer science degrees, with serious implications for our economy and for women at large. <br />
<br />
The problem of getting girls more interested in tech has many sources, but according to Google’s own <a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/file/d/0B-E2rcvhnlQ_a1Q4VUxWQ2dtTHM/edit"">research</a>, one of them is optics. Girls don’t see positive role models of other girls and women in popular culture. In a study of popular films in 11 countries, fewer than 20 percent of computer science or tech roles were held by women. <br />
<br />
As someone who runs a company at the intersection of technology and media, I want to help change the perceptions of women and technology we see today. So, as part of our <a href=""http://www.madewithcode.com/"">Made with Code</a> and <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/03/18/google-abc-disney-pair-up-to-promote-images-of-girls-and-computer-science/24903551/"">media perception</a> initiatives, I’m excited that we’re supporting award-winning documentary filmmaker <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2026261/"">Lesley Chilcott</a>—of “An Inconvenient Truth” and “Waiting for Superman” fame—on her next film, “<a href=""http://www.madewithcode.com/codegirl"">CODEGIRL</a>.”<br />
<br />
“CODEGIRL” follows the story of 5,000 girls from 60 countries as they compete in a global entrepreneurship and coding competition by <a href=""http://www.technovationchallenge.org/"">Technovation</a>. The girls have three months to develop an app that attempts to solve a problem in their local community. In the film, they size up their competition, interact with teachers and local mentors, learn to code, and pitch their ideas all in hopes of winning $10,000 in funding and support. <br />
<br />
Starting today and until November 5, Lesley’s film will be available for free on YouTube, before its theatrical debut in the next few weeks. You can watch the film below and use the hashtag #rallyforcodegirl to show your support.<br />
<iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/aFF8PYDU0D8"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
Our goal is to inspire as many students as possible during this special five-day free viewing period before it hits theaters. With your help, we’ll be able to inspire more girls around the world to pursue their passions in tech. <br />

3870455982162271050,,Google Blogs,2015-10-29T09:00:00-07:00,Trend or treat: Searching for the top Halloween costumes,"“How many days until Halloween?”<br />
“What should I be for Halloween?”<br />
<br />
In the weeks leading up to All Hallows’ Eve you turn to Google Search to ask these two crucial questions. So with just days left to perfect a costume for yourself, your kid, your pooch or your partner, here’s a look at some of the top Halloween costume trends across the United States. For more, see&nbsp;<a href=""http://g.co/frightgeist"">Frightgeist</a>, our Google Trends Halloween hub.<br />
<br />
<b>Hair-raising </b><br />
If your costume involves a certain familiar ‘do, prepare to have company. Get-ups based on the bombastic GOP candidate for President are spiking, with the top-related search being “Donald Trump wig.” And don’t go looking for blue or purple hair-dye at the last minute on Saturday: chances are it will already have been bought up by kids dressing up as Disney’s “Descendants” characters Mal and Evie. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xYzxcC83jkI/VjI-5h9OI_I/AAAAAAAARTc/nCAKUD6Mt08/s1600/Beutler_GS_trend-list_Oct28_costume_FB.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""334"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xYzxcC83jkI/VjI-5h9OI_I/AAAAAAAARTc/nCAKUD6Mt08/s640/Beutler_GS_trend-list_Oct28_costume_FB.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div>And if you’re aiming for a unique costume, you might want to avoid buns on the side of your head too. “Star Wars” is the second most searched costume nationwide, and within that Princess Leia reigns supreme above Dark Side standbys Stormtrooper and Darth Vader.<br />
<br />
<b>Superhero Squad</b><br />
“Suicide Squad” may not hit box offices until next summer, but one character from the film is already making a killing in costume searches. “Harley Quinn” takes the top search spot nationwide (rival Batman is in fifth place). But Harley and Bruce Wayne are just a few of the superheroes (and super villains) you can look for this weekend: People are also donning their cuffs for Wonder Woman, their creepy facepaint for Joker, their bodysuits for Catwoman, and their half shell as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (T-U-R-T-L-E Power!). Even lesser-known characters like Scarlet Witch, Vision, Wasp are getting a boost from film franchises like “The Avengers” and “Ant-Man.”<br />
<br />
<b>Frightful Fidos</b><br />
“Dog costume” is always a top search around Halloween—but not because you’re dressing up as Snoopy or Scooby. No, you’re searching for the cutest costume for your four-legged friend. In addition to being adorable, the top dog costumes are just as “Star Wars”-filled as the top human costumes. We assume that’s because they’ve already got the fur and/or ears to make it work.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wj6kODlya3s/VjI-5LGW55I/AAAAAAAARTU/S2QxRSxmJd8/s1600/Beutler_GS_trend-list_Oct28_dogcostume_FB.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""334"" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wj6kODlya3s/VjI-5LGW55I/AAAAAAAARTU/S2QxRSxmJd8/s640/Beutler_GS_trend-list_Oct28_dogcostume_FB.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div>If dressing your pooch as Chewy feels like asking for trouble, other popular canine costumes include “lion,” “dinosaur,” “shark” and … <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=olaf+character"">Olaf</a>. Because—ahem—you still can’t let “Frozen” go. <br />
<br />
<b>Better together</b><br />
When you want a partner in crime or just want insurance against looking silly solo, couples costumes are the way to go. This year, you’re dressing up as famous pop culture pairs like Bonnie and Clyde (the top couples costume overall), Jasmine and Aladdin, Woody and Jessie&nbsp;from ""Toy Story,""&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=danny+and+sandy"">Danny and Sandy</a>&nbsp;from ""Grease,"" and Barbie and Ken. You’re keeping that Halloween realness with searches for <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=gomez+and+morticia+addams"">Gomez and Morticia Addams</a> and Beetlejuice (#2 on the list, and <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=beetlejuice+couples+costumes"">based on Google Images</a> subject to lots of interpretation). And you’re bringing new meaning to the phrase “I’m dressing up with my boo” with searches for a “<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=boo%20and%20sully&amp;rct=j"">Boo and Sully</a>” costume from “Monsters, Inc.”<br />
<br />
<b>The treat in “trick or treat”</b><br />
Even for adults, Halloween is an excuse to eat junk food. In the past month you’ve searched for candy corn, candy apples and Halloween variations on all of your favorite sweets, from donuts to pudding cups to Kit Kats. But one candy reigns supreme: marshmallows (no, not <a href=""https://www.android.com/versions/marshmallow-6-0/"">that marshmallow</a>) are the top searched candy over the past month. <br />

Over the next few years, we’re hoping that Loon will help put high-speed LTE Internet connections within reach of more than 100 million Indonesians, giving them access to the limitless educational, cultural, and economic opportunities of the Internet.<br />

In Indonesia today, only about 1 out of every 3 people are connected to the web, and most of their connections are painfully slow. Many people live in areas without existing Internet infrastructure; on an archipelago of over 17,000 islands, with mountains and jungles, it’s difficult to run fiber optic cable or install mobile phone towers. That’s where Loon comes in. Loon balloons act like floating cell phone towers in the sky. Flying on the winds at altitudes twice as high as commercial planes, each one beams a connection down to the ground; as one balloon drifts out of range, another moves in to take its place. We hope this could help local operators extend the coverage of their existing networks, and reach further into rural and remote areas.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>Project Loon balloons travel approximately 20 km above the Earth’s surface in the stratosphere. Winds in the stratosphere are stratified, and each layer of wind varies in speed and direction. By moving with the wind, the balloons can be arranged to form one large communications network.</i></div>
<br />
These tests with Indosat, Telkomsel, and XL Axiata are an important step toward bringing all of Indonesia online, and a key milestone for the Loon team as we continue to test, learn and expand the project.<br />
<br />
Of course, to make the Internet not just accessible but useful, there’s more to do, and we have a wide variety of efforts underway in Indonesia and elsewhere to help achieve that goal. For example, <a href=""http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.sg/2015/02/selamat-datang-android-one-high-quality.html"">Android One</a> phones are helping to make affordable high-quality smartphones more accessible in places where most people first access the Internet on a mobile device. We’ve also built features for when connections are slow or nonexistent, such as <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+google/posts/XZo6qgrNDE9"">Search Lite</a> and <a href=""http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.sg/2014/12/buffering-wheel-stand-aside-introducing.html"">offline videos on YouTube</a>. And Google Translate for Bahasa and <a href=""http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.sg/2014/12/say-hello-with-google-translate-in.html"">Sundanese</a> can help knock down the language barrier between Indonesia and the rest of the web.  <br />
<br />
The Internet is still out of reach for too many people, but we’re making progress. If all goes well, soon many more millions of people in Indonesia will be able to bring their ideas, culture and businesses online. At that point, the sky’s the limit.<br />

Phone in the kitchen? Laptop in the living room? OnHub will intelligently select the best combination of antennas to direct Wi-Fi to your devices, based on their location and orientation. The best part is, if you already have an OnHub, your router will automatically update when your network is quiet so it won’t interrupt your connection. Learn more about OnHub's platform: <br />

We wanted to give you an update on where things stand as we continue to think about what Google—and all of us—can do to help. <br />
<br />
A month ago we invited everyone to make a <a href=""https://onetoday.google.com/page/refugeerelief"">donation</a> to support the work of organizations providing essential assistance to refugees and migrants. We were amazed that in just over 48 hours people around the world donated €5M ($5.5. million) to support the work of Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. As promised, we then matched your donations with €5M in <a href=""http://google.org/"">Google.org</a> grants to support high-impact projects, like offering wireless connectivity solutions in refugee camps, providing emergency cash transfers to refugees in Jordan and Lebanon, and enabling access to education. Googlers around the world also gave, donating more than €1.2M (matched by Google) to charities working on the humanitarian efforts.<br />
<br />
These organizations and their staff are doing incredible work in very difficult circumstances, and have the skills and contacts necessary on the ground. With that in mind, we’ve been working with them to better understand how our technology expertise can be put to work, too. One issue identified was the the lack of timely, hyperlocal information for refugees. Working with the <a href=""http://www.rescue.org/"">International Rescue Committee</a> and <a href=""http://www.mercycorps.org/"">Mercy Corps</a>, we’ve developed an <a href=""https://github.com/google/crisis-info-hub"">open source</a> project called “<a href=""http://refugeeinfo.eu/lesbos"">Crisis Info Hub</a>” to disseminate such information in a lightweight, battery-saving way. Already live in Lesvos (with more locations coming online shortly) and being run by our NGO partners, Crisis Info Hub is providing refugees—<a href=""http://time.com/4062120/see-how-smartphones-have-become-a-lifeline-for-refugees/"">most of whom carry smartphones</a>—with critical information for their journeys: lodging, transportation, medical facilities, etc. And we’re working to make connectivity in the region more widespread and reliable by partnering with <a href=""http://www.nethope.org/"">NetHope</a> to deploy robust access solutions where they’re needed most.<br />

Just this year, we saw a 5X growth in Arabic translations in Germany, which got us thinking about what we could do to make our products work better for Arabic speakers in these places. We’ve since <a href=""http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2015/10/two-new-translate-features-coming-your.html"">added Arabic</a> as our 28th language for instant visual translation, enabling immediate, offline translation of signs and other printed text from English or German to Arabic. We’re also asking anyone who knows the languages spoken by refugees or the countries they’re traveling through to help us improve translations through <a href=""http://translate.google.com/community"">Google Translate Community</a>—our goal is 2 million community contributions. Hundreds of thousands of people have helped out already; if you speak Arabic and German, we’d love your help.<br />

When we launched Google Photos in May, we wanted to make all these experiences even better—with unlimited high quality storage so you never need to worry about where to store your snapshots, automatic organization and great search so you can quickly find the photo you’re looking for, and easy sharing so you can send any photo to anyone with just a link. Five months later, we’ve crossed more than 100 million monthly active users—and to celebrate, we’ve collected a few factoids we’ve discovered about people and the things we photograph, along with a few tips. <br />

This year’s theme, “What makes me…me,” invites students K-12 to express themselves in the form of a doodle highlighting what makes them unique. <br />
<br />
But wait don’t get out those pencils just yet. This year, there’s a twist.  <br />
<br />
Doodle 4 Google is now in its eighth year (if Doodle 4 Google were a kid, it’d be a third grader)—so we decided to mix things up a bit to let kids’ imaginations really run wild. For the first time, there are no constraints on medium: students can cook, build, cut, spin, paint, or mold their doodle–basically use any material they like as long as they incorporate the letters G-O-O-G-L-E. The Doodle team itself has used a variety of unexpected materials over the years; for example, one <a href=""https://www.google.com/doodles/earth-day-2012"">Earth Day</a>, we grew a bed of flowers to spell out the doodle. So we figured: let’s open the doors for all the creative kids out there do the same.<br />

I made my doodle out of clay, baked it in the oven, and painted it with acrylic paint. The succulent was taken from my garden.

We anticipate a whole lot of creative use of pottery, crochet, cookie dough and more by students (although of course we want all the drawings and paintings too!), so we figured we need some help picking out the winning artwork. We have an amazing group of guest judges: professional basketball player Stephen Curry, astronaut Dr. Yvonne Cagle, director and author BJ Novak, professional soccer player Alex Morgan, Emmy-award winner Julie Bowen and animator Glen Keane (more on the judges <a href=""http://google.com/doodle4google/judges.html?utm_source=ogb&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=d4g15"">on our site</a>). <br />
<br />
Together, with the Doodle Team, we’ll pick one National Winner who will have their artwork displayed on the Google homepage for millions to see, receive $30,000 towards a college scholarship, and meet and work with the Doodle team on a visit to Mountain View, Calif. Plus, their school will get to spend $50,000 on technology. <br />
<br />
Submissions are open until December 7. And for teachers, check out some classroom ideas and <a href=""http://google.com/doodle4google/classroom.html?utm_source=ogb&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=d4g15"">activities</a> to get your young artists ready to Doodle!<br />

1417241064734090746,,Google Blogs,2015-10-07T07:00:00-07:00,"Introducing the Accelerated Mobile Pages Project, for a faster, open mobile web","Smartphones and tablets have revolutionized the way we access information, and today people consume a tremendous amount of news on their phones. Publishers around the world use the mobile web to reach these readers, but the experience can often leave a lot to be desired. Every time a webpage takes too long to load, they lose a reader—and the opportunity to earn revenue through advertising or subscriptions.  That's because advertisers on these websites have a hard time getting consumers to pay attention to their ads when the pages load so slowly that people abandon them entirely.<br />
<br />
Today, after discussions with publishers and technology companies around the world, we’re announcing a new open source initiative called <a href=""http://www.ampproject.org/"">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a>, which aims to dramatically improve the performance of the mobile web. We want webpages with rich content like video, animations and graphics to work alongside smart ads, and to load instantaneously. We also want the same code to work across multiple platforms and devices so that content can appear everywhere in an instant—no matter what type of phone, tablet or mobile device you’re using. <br />
<br />
The project relies on AMP HTML, a new open framework built entirely out of existing web technologies, which allows websites to build light-weight webpages. To give you a sense of what a faster mobile web might look like, we’ve developed this demo on <a href=""http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2015/10/accelerated-mobile-pages-in-search.html"">Google Search</a>:<br />
<video autoplay="""" controls="""" height=""720"" loop="""" width=""360""><br />
<source src=""https://www.google.com/images/google-blog-assets/amp-phone-10062015.mp4"" type=""video/mp4""></source><br />
</video><br />
Over time we anticipate that other Google products such as Google News will also integrate AMP HTML pages. And today we’re announcing that nearly 30 publishers from around the world are taking part too. <br />
<br />
This is the start of an exciting collaboration with publishers and technology companies, who have all come together to make the mobile web work better for everyone. <a href=""http://twitter.com/"">Twitter</a>, <a href=""http://pinterest.com/"">Pinterest</a>, <a href=""http://wordpress.com/"">WordPress.com</a>, <a href=""https://chartbeat.com/"">Chartbeat</a>, <a href=""http://www.parsely.com/"">Parse.ly</a>, <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/web-analytics.html"">Adobe Analytics</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/"">LinkedIn</a> are among the first group of technology partners planning to integrate AMP HTML pages.<br />
<br />
In the coming months we’ll work with other participants in the project to build more features and functionality focused on some key areas:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Content</b>: Publishers increasingly rely on rich content like image carousels, maps, social plug-ins, data visualizations, and videos to make their stories more interactive and stand out. They also need to implement ads and analytics in order to monetize the content and to understand what their readers like and dislike. The Accelerated Mobile Pages Project provides an open source approach, allowing publishers to focus on producing great content, while relying on the shared components for high performance and great user experience. The initial technical specification—developed with input and code from our partners in the publishing and technology sectors—is being released today on <a href=""https://github.com/ampproject"">GitHub</a>.</li>
<li><b>Distribution</b>: Publishers want people to enjoy the great journalism they create anywhere and everywhere, so stories or content produced in Spain can be served in an instant across the globe in, say, Chile.  That  means distribution across all kinds of devices and platforms is crucial. So, as part of this effort, we’ve designed a new approach to caching that allows the publisher to continue to host their content while allowing for efficient distribution through Google's high performance global cache. We intend to open our cache servers to be used by anyone free of charge.</li>
<li><b>Advertising</b>: Ads help fund free services and content on the web. With Accelerated Mobile Pages, we want to support a comprehensive range of ad formats, ad networks and technologies.  Any sites using AMP HTML will retain their choice of ad networks, as well as any formats that don’t detract from the user experience. It’s also a core goal of the project to support subscriptions and paywalls. We’ll work with publishers and those in the industry to help define the parameters of an ad experience that still provides the speed we’re striving for with AMP.</li>
</ul>
<br />
We hope the open nature of Accelerated Mobile Pages will protect the free flow of information by ensuring the mobile web works better and faster for everyone, everywhere.<br />

It’s called the Google Lunar XPRIZE, and it’s been going on in labs and universities from Brazil to Japan to Carnegie Mellon. With <a href=""http://lunar.xprize.org/teams"">16 remaining teams</a> of scientists, explorers and adventurers hard at work designing and fundraising, the race is on to be the first privately-funded moon landing (and to take home a share of the $30 million prize purse that comes with it).<br />
<br />
This week, they all got a little bit closer. Team SpaceIL, a team of engineers based in Israel, has just managed to secure a “ticket to the moon”—in the form of an official, verified launch contract—for its spacecraft on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The spacecraft will hitch a ride in a specially designed capsule on the Falcon 9; once separated from the launcher and released from the capsule, it will use navigation sensors to guide it to the lunar surface. Here’s a first look at the craft that will be heading to the moon in 2017:<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wDH-_YNfvhA/VhRxMjL-2nI/AAAAAAAAROw/D0KMAEOd26A/s1600/SpaceIL_spacecraft05.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""480"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wDH-_YNfvhA/VhRxMjL-2nI/AAAAAAAAROw/D0KMAEOd26A/s640/SpaceIL_spacecraft05.gif"" width=""640"" /></a></div><i>An artist’s rendering of SpaceIL’s newly-designed spacecraft</i><br />
<br />
And this is where the real fun begins. We kicked off this challenge in 2007 to foster innovation and entrepreneurship in space through low-cost, efficient access to the moon. But until now, all the tinkering has been on terra firma. SpaceIL’s securing of a verified launch contract by the December 2015 deadline keeps the competition open to all Google Lunar XPRIZE teams, who now have until the end of 2016 to secure their own launch contracts to head to the moon by the end of 2017. <br />
<br />
The moon is not only our nearest neighbor in space, but also the gateway to the rest of the universe—providing exciting opportunities for discovery, and giving the rest of us a chance to engage more with science, technology and innovation. We hear a lot about “moonshots” these days, but this is the real thing. <br />
<br />
So, congratulations to SpaceIL for getting to this phase, and to the other 15 teams: the new space race is on! Just like the astronauts, explorers and moonwalkers who came before you, you’re pushing the limits of what’s possible—let’s see who will make history.<br />

Today we’re introducing a few new things that do just that: two Nexus phones, a tablet for work and play, updates to Chromecast and features for some of your favorite apps—all working together to make your day a little bit easier and more fun.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RFOcaNS3JRQ/VgqhGYRZMXI/AAAAAAAARM4/Q684n8gAt5Y/s1600/HARDWARE-MONTAGE_V1b_NW_cropped.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""360"" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RFOcaNS3JRQ/VgqhGYRZMXI/AAAAAAAARM4/Q684n8gAt5Y/s640/HARDWARE-MONTAGE_V1b_NW_cropped.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></div><b>New Nexus phones</b><br />
We made Android to be an open platform that anyone can build on, and today there are 4,000+ Android devices in all shapes and sizes. Android’s diversity is why it’s become the most popular mobile platform in the world, and the latest version, <a href=""http://www.android.com/versions/marshmallow-6-0/"">Marshmallow</a>, takes Android to a new level of performance. <br />
<br />
While we love all the Android devices out there, every year we build <a href=""http://google.com/nexus"">Nexus</a> devices to show off the latest and greatest, directly from the people who built Android. Today we’re introducing the latest Nexus treats, both running Marshmallow, sweetened by amazing apps and sandwiched by some cutting-edge hardware (see what we did there?):<br />
<ul><li><a href=""https://youtu.be/4cAHL4LMNlY"">Nexus 6P</a> is the first all-metal-body Nexus phone. Built in collaboration with Huawei, this 5.7” phone is crafted from aeronautical-grade aluminum, with a USB Type-C port for fast charging, a powerful 64-bit processor, and a 12.3 MP camera sensor with massive 1.55µm pixels (hello, better photos!). The Nexus 6P starts at $499.</li>
<li>You’re not the only one who misses your Nexus 5. We’ve joined forces with LG to bring it back with the new <a href=""https://youtu.be/QLqHZLdt_jE"">Nexus 5X</a>, which gives you great performance in a compact and light package, with a beautiful 5.2” screen and the same 12.3 MP camera and Type-C port as the Nexus 6P. Nexus 5X starts at $379.</li>
</ul>Both phones include a new fingerprint sensor, Nexus Imprint, which gives you quick and secure access to your phone, as well as use of Android Pay (in the U.S.). They are available for pre-order <a href=""https://store.google.com/category/phones?utm_source=gblog&amp;utm_medium=post_he&amp;utm_campaign=9_29-launches"">on the Google Store</a> from a number of countries, including the U.S., U.K., Ireland and Japan, and come with a free 90-day subscription to Google Play Music. In the U.S., pre-orders include a $50 Play credit to help you stock up your favorite music, apps, games and shows. And, finally, for you Project Fi fans out there, you'll be happy to know Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X will work on your favorite network.

<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""></div><b>Pixel C</b><br />
We’re expanding the Pixel family by introducing the <a href=""http://pixel.google.com/"">first Android tablet built end-to-end by Google</a>. The Pixel C brings together the benefits of a full-size keyboard with the portability of a tablet. The tablet and keyboard attach magnetically (no docking mechanism FTW), so it’s easy to switch between typing and using the touch screen.<br />
<br />
And if you’re familiar with the <a href=""https://www.google.com/chromebook/pixel/"">Chromebook Pixel</a>, you’ll immediately see the family resemblance: the Pixel C has the same beautiful aluminum design, great display and USB Type-C port. The Pixel C will be available in time for the holidays on the Google Store.<br />
<br />
<b>Cast ALL the things</b><br />
Today we’re introducing two new Chromecast devices. The new <a href=""http://google.com/chromecast"">Chromecast</a> has a fresh design, and is easier to plug into TVs with crowded ports. It supports the latest Wi-Fi standards and adapts more easily to changing Wi-Fi conditions in your home, so you get higher quality video with less buffering. Most importantly, we added two new colors. ;)<br />
<br />
<a href=""http://google.com/chromecast/speakers"">Chromecast Audio</a> is a small device that plugs into your existing speakers, so you can stream your favorite music, radio and podcasts over Wi-Fi, similar to Chromecast. It works with tons of apps, including Spotify, Pandora and Google Play Music. Just like Chromecast, it works from anywhere in your home with your favorite devices, including Android, iOS, and laptops. And it’s available <a href=""https://store.google.com/category/tv_and_audio?utm_source=gblog&amp;utm_medium=post_he_2&amp;utm_term=9_29-launches&amp;utm_campaign=9_29-launches"">on the Google Store</a> and other online retailers for just $35—way less than most Wi-Fi speakers today.<br />
<br />
We’ve also updated the Chromecast app to make it easier for you to find great things to watch or to play, across the thousands of apps that work with Chromecast—whether you feel like browsing or want to search for a specific TV show or movie. For Cast-enabled apps that aren’t already on your phone, we’ll suggest one for you. The updated Chromecast app is rolling out on Android and iOS over the next few weeks.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yX6Kkq7hPJY"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
<b>Your favorite apps... for the whole family </b><br />
All your shiny devices get even better when you have great apps to go with them. So we’re making a few updates to Google Play Music and Google Photos.<br />
<br />
First, Google Play Music will offer a new family plan later this year. Up to six people will be able to use one account for a shared fee of $14.99 a month (instead of $9.99 per person). Get the dance party ready. <br />
<br />
Sharing is a theme of today’s Google Photos updates, too. We’re adding Chromecast support to give you that old-school slideshow experience—dimmed lights optional. In the U.S., you can now add private labels to your photos to make it easier to search for specific pics of people with things, places or other people—say, that photo of Mom at the Grand Canyon, or of your daughter with her pet bunny. And soon you’ll be able to pool all your photos and videos with friends and family in one place, and get updates as soon as new photos are added. Best of all, there’s no setup involved, and you can use any device. So that dance party we mentioned earlier? Now it’s easier to gather all the memories from everyone who was there. <br />
<br />
<b>More to love, for more people</b><br />
From Nexus to Chromecast to Pixel C to Photos, these updates are more than the sum of their parts—they unite great apps with devices that are designed to support them. They’re built to work together, so they <i>do</i>—seamlessly, across all your screens.<br />

But this week, they took a field trip to ancient Mayan ruins using Google Expeditions, a virtual reality teaching tool built with Google Cardboard. Normally, their assignment would involve poring over photocopied photographs, but instead, they stood at the top of Chichen Itza, then examined detailed carvings at Tenochtitlan. Amid “oohs” and “aahhs,” the students shouted out details they noticed and shot hands up to answer Ms. Roman’s questions.<br />

I’m very proud to announce that it’s the train stations of India that are going to help get millions of people online. In the past year, 100 million people in India started using the Internet for the first time. This means there are now more Internet users in India than in every country in the world aside from China. But what's really astounding is the fact that there are still nearly one billion people in India who aren’t online.<br />
<br />
We’d like to help get these next billion Indians online—so they can access the entire web, and all of its information and opportunity. And not just with any old connection—with fast broadband so they can experience the best of the web. That’s why, today, on the occasion of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to our U.S. headquarters, and in line with his Digital India initiative, we announced a new project to provide high-speed public Wi-Fi in 400 train stations across India.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Working with <a href=""http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/"">Indian Railways</a>, which operates one of the world's largest railway networks, and <a href=""http://www.railtelindia.com/"">RailTel</a>, which provides Internet services as RailWire via its extensive fiber network along many of these railway lines, our Access &amp; Energy team plans to bring the first stations online in the coming months. The network will expand quickly to cover 100 of the busiest stations in India before the end of 2016, with the remaining stations following in quick succession.<br />
<br />
Even with just the first 100 stations online, this project will make Wi-Fi available for the more than 10 million people who pass through every day.  This will rank it as the largest public Wi-Fi project in India, and among the largest in the world, by number of potential users. It will also be fast—many times faster than what most people in India have access to today, allowing travelers to stream a high definition video while they’re waiting, research their destination, or download some videos, a book or a new game for the journey ahead. Best of all, the service will be free to start, with the long-term goal of making it self-sustainable to allow for expansion to more stations and other places, with RailTel and more partners, in the future.

We think this is an important part of making the Internet both accessible and useful for the more than 300 million Indians already online, and the nearly one billion more who are not.<br />
<br />
But it’s not the only piece. To help more Indians get access to affordable, high-quality smartphones, which is the primary way most people there access the Internet, we <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.sg/2014/09/for-next-five-billion-android-one.html"">launched Android One last year</a>. To help address the challenges of limited bandwidth, we recently <a href=""http://googleindia.blogspot.sg/2015/06/faster-and-lighter-mobile-web-pages-in.html"">launched</a> a feature that makes mobile webpages load faster and with less data, and we’ve made <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn1yG6jyTAM"">YouTube available offline</a> with <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2015/05/io-2015-mobile-revolution.html"">offline Maps coming soon</a>.<br />
<br />
To help make web content more useful for Indians, many of whom don’t speak English, we launched the Indian Language Internet Alliance last year to foster more local language content, and have built greater local language support into our products—including Hindi Voice Search, an improved Hindi keyboard and support for seven Indian languages with the latest versions of Android. And finally, to help all Indians reap the benefits of connectivity, we’ve been ramping up <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYVx15KEEEs"">efforts to help women</a>, who make up <a href=""http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.in/2014/09/can-internet-enabled-rickshaw-help.html"">just a third</a> of Internet users in India today, get the most from the web.<br />
<br />
Just like I did years ago, thousands of young Indians walk through Chennai Central every day, eager to learn, to explore and to seek opportunity.  It’s my hope that this Wi-Fi project will make all these things a little easier.<br />

<b>Pizza rat is all of us</b><br />
Let’s start with the important stuff. This week the Internet was captivated by a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPXUG8q4jKU"">YouTube video</a> showing a rat carrying a slice of pizza down the stairs of a New York subway station. There were more than <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Pizza+Rat&amp;std=20150921&amp;pn=p1#a=20150921-Pizza+Rat"">50K+ searches for “Pizza Rat”</a> on Monday, and the 14 second-video has more than 6 million views at last count. But while <a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pizza-rat"">#PizzaRat memes</a> multiplied across the web, New Yorkers had some more unsettling questions in mind, like: “How many rats are in New York?” and “What is the rat to people ratio in New York?” (Are you sure you want to know?) Whether Pizza Rat is a <a href=""https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150921/east-village/pizza-rat-is-metaphor-for-life-new-york-city-says-man-who-shot-video"">hero</a> or a <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/09/pizza-rat-is-no-hero.html"">quitter</a>, something about him spoke to us.

This week Pope Francis became the <a href=""http://www.usccb.org/about/leadership/holy-see/francis/papal-visit-2015/history-papal-visits-to-united-states.cfm"">fourth pope to visit the United States</a>, in a highly anticipated tour that took him from <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/09/22/pope-visit-washington-new-york-philadelphia-united-states/72073294/"">D.C. to New York, with a Philadelphia stop</a> still to come. Every day of his visit has brought headlines and curious searches (<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Pope+Francis&amp;std=20150922&amp;pn=p1#a=20150922-Pope+Francis"">more than 500K on Tuesday</a>)—and he’s been busy. He met with President Obama (<a href=""https://instagram.com/p/8CZ-6uwisB/?taken-by=whitehouse"">and the President’s dogs</a>) at the White House, stopped by the Capitol to give a <a href=""http://time.com/4048176/pope-francis-us-visit-congress-transcript/"">joint address to Congress</a> (the first time a pontiff has ever done so), <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/647086691656663040"">canonized Junipero Serra</a>, visited the 9/11 Memorial, spoke at the United Nations and made statements on everything ranging from climate change to the refugee crisis. <br />

Perhaps the most interesting—and inspiring—searches about the Pope’s visit are those looking for information on what he has said. Notably, people wanted to learn more about Thomas Merton and Dorothy Day, whom the Pope described in his joint address to Congress as Americans who had “built a better future” through “hard work and self-sacrifice” (the other two Americans he mentioned? Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr.).  In fact, searches for Dorothy Day, the founder of the Catholic Worker Movement and an advocate for social justice, <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/647103535130152961"">spiked 1700x</a> after the Pope discussed her in his speech.<br />

She has been a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science since 2011 and served as president of the National Association of Science Writers in 2009 and 2010. She joins us here today to share her perspective on the Google Science Fair, which is in its fifth edition this year. </i>-Ed.<br />
<br />
This marks my fifth year with the <a href=""http://www.googlesciencefair.com/"">Google Science Fair</a>. In October 2010, when I had my first conversations with my friends at Google about their idea to create a global online science fair that any kid 13–18 could participate in, I thought it sounded pretty cool. But I couldn’t then imagine just how inspiring and powerful such a competition would turn out to be in reality.<br />
<br />
At the time, I hadn’t even been editor in chief of <i>Scientific American </i>for a year, but I had real ambitions to try to do something to make a difference in educating our young people about science. You see, I believe that science is the engine of human prosperity—it’s the way we grapple with some of the world’s most challenging problems, from cures for diseases to living sustainably in a finite world. So I’ve always seen the idea of fostering evidence-based thinking in our next generation of global citizens as vital.<br />
<br />
Now, five years later and working with partners LEGO Education, <i>National Geographic</i> and Virgin Galactic, the Google Science Fair has an impressive track record of enabling our world’s young scientists to shine. Over the years, they’ve tackled serious issues, like world hunger and the energy crisis. Their projects have worked on how to diagnose and treat diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s. They’ve engineered flashlights powered by their hands and plastics made of banana peels. And to date, the fair has provided almost $1 million in scholarships, and sent four grand prize winners on trips around the world to further their scientific passions.<br />
<br />
Tonight we added some new winners to that list as we recognized and celebrated the 2015 top 20 finalist projects and the bright young scientists behind them:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>The Grand Prize went to <a href=""http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/08/spotlight-on-young-scientist-olivia.html"">Olivia Hallisey</a> for creating a novel way to detect Ebola.</li>
<li><a href=""http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/08/spotlight-on-young-scientist-girish.html"">Girish Kumar</a> won the Google Technologist Award for helping improve learning through auto-generated study questions.</li>
<li>The <i>National Geographic</i> Explorer Award went to <a href=""http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/08/spotlight-on-young-scientist-deepika.html"">Deepika Kurup</a> for her idea to use solar-powered silver to create clean drinking water.</li>
<li><a href=""http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/08/spotlight-on-a-young-scientist-Krtin-Nithiyanandam.html"">Krtin Nithiyanadam</a>’s project focused on improved diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease and won him the <i>Scientific American</i> Innovator Award.</li>
<li><a href=""http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/08/spotlight-on-young-scientist-pranav.html"">Pranav Sivakumar</a>'s&nbsp;automated search for gravitationally lensed quasars earned him&nbsp;the Virgin Galactic Pioneer Award.</li>
<li>And <a href=""http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/08/spotlight-on-a-young-scientist-anurudh-ganesan.html"">Anurudh Ganesan</a> took home The LEGO Education Builder Award for his unique twist on effectively transporting vaccines.</li>

<br />
In all of these finalists and the thousands of submissions from students in 100+ countries, we see something common. These students are inventive, thoughtful, and determined to help make the world a better place. All they need is a chance and a platform to do so. And, unlike some of us adults, they are ready to try things that other people think are “impossible.” I find them inspiring.<br />
<br />
It’s imperative for us to support and encourage our young people to explore and challenge the world around them through scientific discovery. So we’re especially glad that Ahmed Mohamed—the 14-year-old clock maker from Texas—took us up on <a href=""https://twitter.com/googlescifair/status/644219471469629440"">our invite</a> to attend this year’s event.

The past decades have brought tremendous innovations and challenges, and none of us knows what the future of scientific discovery holds. But I can tell you one thing: it’s going to be better thanks to these kids. They will be part of building a brighter future for us all—and as they do, those of us at Scientific American,&nbsp;Google, LEGO Education, National Geographic and Virgin Galactic will be cheering them on.<span id=""goog_66082361""></span><br />

In the days that followed, thousands of people expressed their support for Mohamed online with the hashtag #IStandwithAhmed, and he received invitations to visit the White House, MIT, Facebook—and yes, even Google.

<b>Nature’s ways</b><br />
California has been battling brutal wildfires this year, as the drought has dried up fields and forests across the state. Last week’s <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Butte+Fire&amp;std=20150910&amp;pn=p1#a=20150910-Butte+Fire"">Butte Fire</a> threatened thousands of acres and burned hundreds of homes, and it seemed like as soon as it was contained the Valley Fire in Lake County was blazing. Searchers turned to the web with questions like “How does a wildfire create its own weather?” and “Why are the wildfires getting worse?” But while firefighters worked around the clock up north to stop the inferno, southern California was breaking records for rainfall. Really. Tuesday was the <a href=""http://abc7.com/weather/los-angeles-county-hit-with-record-breaking-rainfall/986504/"">second-wettest day</a> in L.A. in September since 1877, with 50,000+ searches for [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Weather+Los+Angeles&amp;std=20150915&amp;pn=p1#a=20150915-Weather+Los+Angeles"">weather Los Angeles</a>] as astonished Angelenos looked to learn more about this unfamiliar wet stuff falling from the sky. <br />

Mother Nature wasn’t through with her surprises, though. Wednesday, an 8.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Chile, forcing 1 million people to evacuate—and causing 2 million searches for [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Chile+earthquake&amp;std=20150916&amp;pn=p1#a=20150916-Chile+earthquake"">Chile earthquake</a>]. Tsunami warnings were in effect as far away as California, Japan and New Zealand. Despite some casualties and billions of dollars’ worth of damages, <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/death-toll-from-chile-earthquake-rises-1-million-evacuate/"">experts say</a> that Chile’s investments in structural reinforcements and other earthquake preparedness prevented the disaster from being much worse.<br />

I was born in war-torn Kabul, Afghanistan. When I was seven, my family and I fled to Europe with our belongings in a single suitcase, hoping for a safer and better future. Our journey involved many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear. Fortunately, we received asylum in The Netherlands, where I grew up in a safe environment and was able to find my way in life. Today, I work for Google in California.<br />
<br />
I was lucky. But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown, many people like my family are desperate for help. Last week, Google announced a €1 million (~$1.1 million) donation to organizations who are providing front-line humanitarian relief to refugees and migrants around the world. Today, we're inviting you to <a href=""https://onetoday.google.com/page/refugeerelief"">join us</a>. To double the impact of your contribution, we’ll match the first €5 million (~$5.5 million) in donations globally, until together we raise €10 million (~$11 million) for relief efforts.<br />
<br />
Your donation will be distributed to four nonprofits providing aid to refugees and migrants: <a href=""http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/our-work/humanitarian-issues/refugees-and-idps"">Doctors Without Borders</a>, <a href=""http://www.rescue.org/blog/refugee-crisis-europe"">International Rescue Committee</a>, <a href=""http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.8721487/"">Save the Children</a> and <a href=""http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home"">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a>. These nonprofits are helping deliver essential assistance—including shelter, food and water, and medical care—and looking after the security and rights of people in need. <br />

South of Samburu, up into the hills of Kenya, the <a href=""http://www.lewa.org/"">Lewa Wildlife Conservancy</a> awaits exploration. In this greener landscape, you can cross the open savannah, where animals like zebras and rhinoceroses live protected from poachers and hunters. Every day, the <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@0.1967745,37.4640695,3a,75y,16.81h,85.3t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1suyJNaq4BIWQEDdMt6QWn_A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656"">Lewa radio command center</a> plots the movements of elephants (and other GPS-collared wildlife) onto Google Earth to help rangers determine where elephants are and when they might be in danger. If an elephant’s GPS collar sends an alert to indicate the elephant has stopped moving, a team of rangers and tracking dogs will investigate. Save the Elephants was one of the first organizations to use this technology, having collared 266 elephants across Africa since 1998.<br />

Visiting the <a href=""http://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/index.asp"">David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust</a>, you can see the devastating effect of poaching and other causes of elephant deaths in Kenya. Founded in 1977, the Trust provides lifesaving assistance to wild animals in need, including orphaned elephants and rhinos. At their Elephant Orphanage in Nairobi, elephant caretakers stand in for an elephant’s lost family, providing 24/7 care and specially formulated milk. As the orphans grow, they are gradually reintegrated back into the wild, where they are protected by the charity’s Anti-Poaching and Aerial Surveillance Teams. To date, the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has hand-raised more than 180 orphaned infant elephants, including little <a href=""http://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/asp/orphan_profile.asp?N=312"">Sokotei</a>, who I helped to rescue in Samburu after his mother died of natural causes when he was six months old. He’s just one elephant amid thousands that have been lost across the continent, but when you're up against a challenge of this scale, every elephant counts.<br />

<br />
<b>That interview</b><br />
Stephen Colbert took to the air as the new host of CBS’ The Late Show Tuesday, with an impressive <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6692484/stephen-colberts-late-show-debut-66-million-viewers"">6.6 million viewers</a> and <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Stephen+Colbert&amp;std=20150908&amp;pn=p1#a=20150908-Stephen+Colbert"">half a million Google searches</a> for the premiere, and a <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=stephen%20colbert&amp;date=now%207-d&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B7"">search spike</a> every night since. The week’s star-studded line-up included actors George Clooney and Scarlett Johanssen, but by Friday morning it was guest Vice President Joe Biden who was <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Joe+Biden&amp;std=20150911&amp;pn=p1#a=20150911-Joe+Biden"">driving the search buzz</a> for the frank and emotional conversation he had with Colbert about the family tragedies both have suffered. The interview wasn’t all serious—the VP joked about the host’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Colbert_presidential_campaign,_2008"">2008 run for the presidency</a>, and proposed joining forces for 2016.  A Colbert-Biden ticket would be tough to beat (in searches, at least).<br />
<br />
<b>Venus vs. Serena (vs. Roberta)</b><br />
Game on. As Venus and Serena Williams faced each other this week in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open, the sisters generated a combined <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends"">one+ million searches</a> from people following the action online. Serena ultimately beat out older sister Venus both on the court and on Google—<a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=venus%20williams%2C%20serena%20williams&amp;date=now%207-d&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B7"">topping Venus Tuesday</a> in search volume. Heading into the weekend, all eyes continued to be on Serena and her bid for the first tennis Grand Slam win since Steffi Graf’s in 1988. But it wasn’t to be. As Serena suffered a shocking semifinal upset by Roberta Vinci of Italy this afternoon, people from Jamaica to Romania to Zimbabwe <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=serena%20williams&amp;date=now%201-d&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B7"">followed the action</a> on Google.<br />

This week, <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/trends/story/GB_cu_GMmrrk8BAAD85M_en"">Queen Elizabeth II</a> became Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, surpassing the record set by great-great-grandmum Queen Victoria. (According to the <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34177107"">BBC</a>, this happened at 23,226 days, 16 hours and approximately 30 minutes … but who’s counting?) This milestone was popular across the pond—the U.S. was the top country outside the Commonwealth searching for information about Her Royal Highness. But her loyal subjects in the U.K. also had questions. Besides some basics like the Queen’s age and her cash flow, one question Brits <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/trends/story/GB_cu_GMmrrk8BAAD85M_en"">repeatedly searched on Google</a> this week was: Why does the Queen celebrate two birthdays? The lengthy <a href=""http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/TheQueensbirthdays.aspx"">official answer</a> on the royal website references the weather, King Edward VII, and horses. An alternative answer? Because she can.<br />
<br />
<b>It’s Welsh, and it starts with an L (two, actually)</b><br />
At 58 letters, the Welsh village of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch has the longest and most notoriously difficult-to-say place name in the United Kingdom. And after Welsh weatherman Liam Dutton nailed its pronunciation live on air Wednesday (and subsequently on YouTube), people around the world turned to Google with a collective “Whoa!” Along with wanting to know if this is a real place (yes, indeed), and how it got its name (unconfirmed, but one YouTube commenter suggests it was named by a cat taking a walk on a keyboard), the top search on Google was, of course, how to pronounce it. With 7 million views and counting, here’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHxO0UdpoxM"">weatherman Dutton with the answer</a>. Show-off. <br />

And just like you can sew together different pieces of fabric to make a dress, or choose different items from your closet to create an unexpected outfit, you can also put together code to make something that’s never existed before. <br />

Today, as New York’s Fashion Week kicks off, fashion and technology are coming together in a new way. <a href=""https://www.madewithcode.com/"">Made with Code</a> and <a href=""http://www.zacposen.com/"">ZAC Zac Posen</a> are teaming up to show how computer science can push the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of fashion. A dress designed by Zac Posen and with designs coded online by teen girls will debut as the finale look of Zac’s show—and hopefully inspire young girls who have an interest in fashion to see what code can help them create. <br />

For this project, girls from organizations like Black Girls Code, the Flatiron School, Girls Who Code and Lower East Side Girls Club, coded designs for an LED dress using an introductory coding project online. Fashion engineer and Made with Code mentor, <a href=""https://www.madewithcode.com/mentors/"">Maddy Maxey</a>, coded and fabricated the LED technology of the dress, working alongside Zac as he designed. When the dress goes down the runway, it will displays girls’ patterns in 500 LED lights, using a <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=micro-controller"">micro controller</a> specially tuned to match Zac’s Spring Summer 2016 runway collection—from Catalina Blue to Acid Yellow. Meanwhile, 50 girls will get seats at the show to see their designs light up the runway.<br />
<br />
In the past year, we’ve seen many encouraging signs that more girls are exploring computer science. More than 5 million coding projects have been tried since Made with Code began a year ago. And Googlers, teen girls and partners like Girls Inc, Technovation and Girl Scouts have thrown 300+ Made with Code <a href=""https://www.madewithcode.com/community/pdf/get/AMIfv96VBZO5VD4IWWTgwb_pKDa0Royc0dFwLLSAFav0SfKgXmE8U2ES2p77tEwDqUu1KvUaW6c_f_-3yzLnd9hXeFB7dRmNXQ5W7cKuiSRvNLjSLY_p0sc-US4Mj43_JUwf-ySdGuU5y7fqgMYudeh-5DrfUkTBwHTKHHaSORHJiBigH9cGrzwB4BKIozgHIUU3vG9563Rr"">parties</a> across the U.S., reaching tens of thousands teen girls in person. But with less than one percent of high school girls still expressing interest in computer science, it’s obvious we have so much more work to do—so, let’s start now.  After today, girls all over the country can also head to <a href=""https://www.madewithcode.com/projects/fashion"">madewithcode.com</a> to create their own design. We hope the digital dress inspires more teens to discover what they can make with code.<br />

<br />
<b>Party at the VMAs</b><br />
It’s been nearly a week since it all went down, but given the number of trending topics related to the Sunday evening spectacle known as the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, we feel almost obligated to recap how it played out on Search. So, here are the highlights: bizarre but wonderful host Miley Cyrus pulled in a cool <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Miley+Cyrus&amp;std=20150830&amp;pn=p1#a=20150830-Miley+Cyrus"">5 million searches</a>, while her <a href=""http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/nicki-minaj-was-livid-with-miley-cyrus-vmas-spat-was-real-2015318"">onstage confrontation</a> with Nicki Minaj (which may or may not have been planned) got another <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Nicki+and+Miley&amp;std=20150831&amp;pn=p1#a=20150831-Nicki+and+Miley"">500,000+</a>. Kanye West accepted the show’s highest honor—<a href=""http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/videos/kanye-west-vma-vanguard-speech/1231121/"">the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award</a>—in a rambling 13-minute speech (during which he may or may not have committed to running for president in 2020), racking up more than <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Kanye+West+Vma+Speech&amp;std=20150830&amp;pn=p1#a=20150830-Kanye+West+Vma+Speech"">200,000 searches</a>. <br />

<b>Kentucky courthouse drama</b><br />
A Kentucky county clerk found new notoriety this week, appearing in Hot Trends not just <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Kim+Davis&amp;std=20150903&amp;pn=p1#a=20150903-Kim+Davis"">once</a> but <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Kim+Davis&amp;std=20150901&amp;pn=p1#a=20150901-Kim+Davis"">three</a> <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Kentucky+clerk&amp;std=20150901&amp;pn=p1#a=20150901-Kentucky+clerk"">times</a>. Kim Davis has repeatedly refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, claiming it would infringe on her religious beliefs. Multiple couples sued her, and Judge David L. Bunning ordered her to issue the licenses. Finally, after her request for a stay from the Supreme Court was <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/08/31/436431204/kentucky-clerk-s-request-for-a-stay-is-denied-by-u-s-supreme-court"">denied</a>, yesterday Davis was held in contempt of court. With Davis in jail, her deputies <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kim-davis-kentucky-clerk-will-stay-jail-long-it-takes-n421676"">began issuing licenses</a> to couples today. As the saga played out in Rowan County, people turned to the web with <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/639841568816365568"">inquiries</a> ranging from “What religion is Kim Davis?” and “What law did Kim Davis break?” to <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/639841480715075585"">more broad questions</a> like “Why do we need marriage licenses?” and “How long have there been marriage licenses in the U.S.?”<br />
<br />
<b>Fall fun</b><br />
The days are getting shorter (in the Northern Hemisphere, at least) and the long Labor Day weekend marks the unofficial end of summer. In the U.S., people have turned to the web to learn more about the origins of Labor Day and to ask an important fashion question: “Why can’t you wear white after Labor Day?” Our advice: <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=why+can%27t+you+wear+white+after+labor+day&amp;oq=why+can%27t+you+wear+white&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.2983j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8"">don’t let anyone tell you you can’t</a>.)<br />

Autumn may make some melancholy, but for football fans it’s a time to rejoice. Tomorrow marks the first college football Saturday of the season, and searchers are gearing up in anticipation. Yesterday’s Michigan game against Utah drew <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Michigan+Football&amp;std=20150903&amp;pn=p1#a=20150903-Michigan+Football"">500,000+ searches</a> as people looked to find more about the game. As the debut game for new Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh, expectations were high, but deflated (see below) when Utah won 24-17. But it’s Michigan rival—and defending national champs—Ohio State that lit up the scoreboard as the most searched team over the past month:<br />

Finally, though the NFL season doesn’t officially start until next Thursday, the league is in the news after Patriots QB Tom Brady’s four-game suspension for “Deflategate” was overturned. Brady was the <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Tom+Brady&amp;std=20150903&amp;pn=p1#a=20150903-Tom+Brady"">top trend Thursday</a>, with 1 million searches, as people asked <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/639496147363454976"">questions</a> like “Is Tom Brady suspended?” and “What does ‘nullified’ mean?”<br />

<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/olFEpeMwgHk?cc_load_policy=1"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
<br />
So why are we doing this now? Once upon a time, Google was one destination that you reached from one device: a desktop PC. These days, people interact with Google products across many different platforms, apps and devices—sometimes all in a single day. You expect Google to help you whenever and wherever you need it, whether it’s on your mobile phone, TV, watch, the dashboard in your car, and yes, even a desktop! <br />
<br />
Today we’re introducing a new logo and identity family that reflects this reality and shows you when the Google magic is working for you, even on the tiniest screens. As you’ll see, we’ve taken the Google logo and branding, which were originally built for a single desktop browser page, and updated them for a world of seamless computing across an endless number of devices and different kinds of inputs (such as tap, type and talk).<br />
<br />
It doesn’t simply tell you that you’re using Google, but also shows you how Google is working for you. For example, new elements like a colorful Google mic help you identify and interact with Google whether you’re talking, tapping or typing. Meanwhile, we’re bidding adieu to the little blue “g” icon and replacing it with a four-color “G” that matches the logo.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""//2.bp.blogspot.com/-Gh9Drj62EFw/VeXMk3xcsOI/AAAAAAAAAxw/knYsAcpaABo/s1600/OGB-INSIDER-BLOGS-GoogleLogox2-Animated.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//2.bp.blogspot.com/-Gh9Drj62EFw/VeXMk3xcsOI/AAAAAAAAAxw/knYsAcpaABo/s1600/OGB-INSIDER-BLOGS-GoogleLogox2-Animated.gif"" width=""640"" /></a></div><br />
This isn’t the first time we’ve changed our look and it probably won’t be the last, but we think today’s update is a great reflection of all the ways Google works for you across Search, Maps, Gmail, Chrome and many others. We think we’ve taken the best of Google (simple, uncluttered, colorful, friendly), and recast it not just for the Google of today, but for the Google of the future.<br />
<br />
You’ll see the new design roll out across our products soon. Hope you enjoy it!<br />

<br />
<b>WDBJ tragedy</b><br />
A small TV station in Roanoke, Va., is reeling after two of its journalists were shot and killed live on air Wednesday morning. Police identified the gunman as a <a href=""http://www.wdbj7.com/news/nation/vester-flanagans-rocky-tenure-at-wdbj-exposed/34951962"">former reporter</a> for the station, and if his horrible crime was designed for maximum shock and attention, it worked.  Searches for Bryce Williams—the on-air name former employee Vester Flanagan went by—ran into the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Bryce+Williams&amp;std=20150826&amp;pn=p1#a=20150826-Bryce+Williams"">tens of millions</a> as people looked for information and video of what had happened.<br />
<br />
<b>Searches in the path of the storm</b><br />
Thursday marked 10 years since Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, but searchers in the U.S. over the last 48 hours have been looking ahead to another storm. Today, news outlets are <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/28/us/tropical-weather-erika/"">reporting</a> that Tropical Storm Erika has already been responsible for deaths in the Caribbean island of Dominica. As <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/tropical-storm-erika-kills-least-dozen-caribbean-n417611"">Florida’s governor</a> declared a state of emergency ahead of Erika’s predicted U.S. landfall Monday, the city of Hialeah in South Florida is the top of the list of cities searching for information on the storm. But whether the storm searches are coming from the U.S. or the Caribbean, “<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=erika&amp;date=now%207-d&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B7"">Erika path</a>” and related terms are up more than 1000 percent this week.<br />

Get out the popcorn. MTV’s annual Video Music Awards is coming up this Sunday, and all eyes will be on Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj following their <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/07/through-google-lens-search-trends-july_24.html"">much-buzzed about</a> Twitter spat over nominations for Music Video of the Year. We turned to search to see if trends could show us whether people are leaning Team Swift or Team Minaj headed into the weekend. Tay-Tay’s music video “Blank Space” is in the lead in the Best Female Video category, followed by Minaj’s “Anaconda.” Though “Anaconda” was not nominated for Music Video of the Year—a category that Swift also leads for “Bad Blood,” according to Google searches—Minaj is top of the search pile in the Best Hip Hop Video category.   <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7-OLL06VrFw/VeDSFCme2nI/AAAAAAAARBg/225LL6nLPxM/s1600/female%2Bvideo.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""320"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7-OLL06VrFw/VeDSFCme2nI/AAAAAAAARBg/225LL6nLPxM/s640/female%2Bvideo.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><br />
In other music news, a report that One Direction will be parting ways up brought a <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=One+Direction&amp;std=20150823&amp;pn=p1#a=20150823-One+Direction"">200,000 search spike</a> earlier in the week. “Are One Direction splitting up?” (perhaps we should make that “ARE ONE DIRECTION SPLITTING UP??!?! :(:(:(”) was the top search question, before the band clarified they are actually just taking a break. As former band member Zayn Malik has already decided to go solo, we read the search tea leaves to see what kind of popularity the current members have should the band, well, disband.  Most likely to launch a successful solo career based on search buzz? Harry Styles is the resounding winner, taking a whopping 60 percent of the 1D searches. Our advice for Liam Payne: at 1 percent, don’t give up your day job.<br />

841029507556283342,,Google Blogs,2015-08-27T08:01:00-07:00,Improving Public Alerts for hurricane season,"Ten years ago, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina"">Hurricane Katrina</a> ravaged the Gulf Coast of the United States, flooding cities, displacing thousands of people, and causing billions of dollars worth of damage. It is the costliest natural disaster, and one of the deadliest hurricanes, in U.S. history.<br />
<br />
After rescue efforts began in the immediate aftermath of Katrina, some Googlers wondered how they could connect people with useful information and resources related to the storm. With the help of many third-party organizations, small groups of our employees worked to display <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/seeing-what-katrina-has-wrought.html"">satellite imagery</a> of affected areas in Google Earth and helped build <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/two-new-katrina-search-tools.html"">searchable databases</a> so people could check on the safety of friends and loved ones. These early efforts later became some of the standard actions taken today by the <a href=""https://www.google.org/crisisresponse/"">Google Crisis Response Team</a> following natural disasters, from hurricanes to earthquakes to tsunamis.<br />
<br />
As the U.S. enters hurricane season again, Katrina remains a stark reminder of the devastation a storm like that can cause. We want to be as prepared and as helpful as possible for the next one—no matter where it hits, or how big it is. So we’re always working to improve our <a href=""https://www.google.org/crisisresponse/"">Crisis Response</a> efforts to help people stay safe and informed during these events. <br />
<br />
With that in mind, we've launched some improvements to weather forecasts and <a href=""https://support.google.com/publicalerts/?hl=en"">Public Alerts</a> in Google Search to track storms during this year's U.S. hurricane season. Now, when you search the web for information about particular <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=tropical%20storm%20san%20juan"">storms</a> or tornadoes, you may see: <br />
<br />
<ul><li>A map showing your location in relation to the oncoming storm</li>
<li>Visualizations of its forecasted track, wind severity and arrival time, courtesy of <a href=""http://www.noaa.gov/"">NOAA</a></li>
<li>Concise instructions for preparing and staying safe, customized for the estimated intensity of the storm and its arrival time relative to your location, from <a href=""http://www.fema.gov/"">FEMA</a> and <a href=""http://www.ready.gov/"">ready.gov</a></li>
</ul><br />
The safety recommendations you receive will be tailored to reflect the current status of the event and your context. For example, if you search for a specific storm when it’s still several days away, you may see a map of the developing weather event and a recommendation to start preparing an emergency kit. If the storm is only hours away from your location, you might receive a reminder to start charging your phone in case power goes out. And if you search when the storm is nearby, you'll get the most urgent information, like how to avoid injury from fast-moving water or flying debris.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5B52VXwUplc/Vd8rgR8fsRI/AAAAAAAAQ_U/40_hQM16a90/s1600/OJPFepyyRzK%2B%25281%2529.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""500"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5B52VXwUplc/Vd8rgR8fsRI/AAAAAAAAQ_U/40_hQM16a90/s500/OJPFepyyRzK%2B%25281%2529.png"" /></a></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i> Tropical storm alert with precise location, wind details and customized safety checklist. Improved tropical storm alerts like this will appear in Search on mobile and desktop. </i></div><br />
Not every storm is as devastating as Katrina was, but they all have the potential to cause damage, disrupt lives, and uproot communities. By providing useful, accurate, early-warning information, we want to do our part to help people prepare. More information won’t stop natural disasters from occurring, but it can go a long way to keeping people safe, and in some cases, could even save lives.<br />

As students and teachers around the world return to campuses and classrooms this fall, we’re embarking on a different kind of fresh start: a New (School) Year. And we want to help you make the most of it. So we’ve put together a few resolution ideas, plus tips to help you stick to them. We’ve also made a resolution of our own: to bring the best of Google technology to education.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9Kk4iDTNWPI/VdvQsYkKSKI/AAAAAAAAQz0/EWivKGoa7Tw/s1600/gCf2mGHGYQjPMdGi2J-8I5PtZtfNyqZAXJ5qsSPUkF0Ohl4V4hWhqW_Trtg3VerJu4qJtQ%253Ds2048.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" data-about-featured="""" height=""216"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9Kk4iDTNWPI/VdvQsYkKSKI/AAAAAAAAQz0/EWivKGoa7Tw/s640/gCf2mGHGYQjPMdGi2J-8I5PtZtfNyqZAXJ5qsSPUkF0Ohl4V4hWhqW_Trtg3VerJu4qJtQ%253Ds2048.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></div><b>The best of Google, for education</b><br />
Like many resolutions, ours might sound familiar—and that’s because the <a href=""http://google.com/edu"">Google for Education </a>team has been working on it for a while. Over the last few years, we’ve spent a lot of time with teachers and students, witnessing firsthand how technology is helping in the classroom and learning about challenges that are yet unsolved. With feedback from schools, we’ve improved products like Google Apps for Education and Docs, building in new features specifically useful for education. We’ve also created new learning experiences like <a href=""http://google.com/edu/classroom"">Google Classroom</a>—a sort of mission control for teachers and students, offering a single place to keep track of all class materials, eliminating paperwork and making it easy for teachers to collaborate with students, and students to collaborate with each other.<br />
<br />
So as part of our resolution this school year, we’re launching some <a href=""http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2015/08/head-back-to-school-with-new-features-in-Google-Classroom.html"">new features in Google Classroom</a>. Teachers can now easily ask students questions in Classroom, alongside all the other class materials in the stream. Teachers also told us that they want more ways for students to engage with each other, and flex their critical thinking muscles. So now students can comment on each other’s answers in Classroom and have open-ended discussions. In the next month, we'll also make it possible for teachers to add assignments, due dates and field trips to a shared calendar. <br />
<br />
<b>So what’s your resolution?</b><br />
We’re sure you’ve already set some big goals for the year ahead—from acing AP Bio to landing that killer internship. Whatever your plans, it can be tough to stick with those goals once assignments and social commitments start to pile up. So we’ve collected <a href=""https://get.google.com/tips/#!/?category=learn-better"">50+ tips</a> from more than 15 Google products to help you follow through with your resolutions. Here are some ideas:<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oF2uU0a7qZw/VdvRopNUrnI/AAAAAAAAQz8/rmxp28xzQBQ/s1600/55TipsGif.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oF2uU0a7qZw/VdvRopNUrnI/AAAAAAAAQz8/rmxp28xzQBQ/s550/55TipsGif.gif"" width=""550"" /></a></div><b>Resolution 1. Get (and stay) organized</b><br />
When you’re bogged down by clutter, it can be tough to get stuff done. Make this your year to be more organized. Never miss another study group with help from <a href=""https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/never-miss-that-weekly-study-group?category=learn-better"">Google Calendar</a>. Use <a href=""https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/get-your-whole-teams-info-in-one-place?category=learn-better"">Google Sheets</a> to keep all your classmates' info in one place, and better manage your inbox by emailing everyone at once with a <a href=""https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/Email-your-whole-class-with-just-one-address?category=learn-better"">Google group</a>. <br />
<br />
<b>Resolution 2. Get (mentally) fit</b><br />
Push yourself to take your studies to the next level. Teach yourself how to code with <a href=""https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/amp-up-your-selfies-with-code?category=learn-better"">Made with Code</a>. Make the most of language class by saving your most used words and phrases with <a href=""https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/save-your-most-needed-translations-for-language-class?category=learn-better"">Google Translate</a> or <a href=""https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/do-research-in-a-language-you-don-t-speak?category=learn-better"">magically translating webpages</a> with Google Chrome. <br />
<br />
<b>Resolution 3. Get some worldly perspective</b><br />
Not studying abroad this year? No problem. You can still unleash your inner explorer with <a href=""https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/tell-your-history-class-what-it-s-like-to-see-the-pyramids?category=learn-better"">Google Maps Treks</a> and visit the Pyramids of Giza or the Great Barrier Reef without leaving your room. Or bring your art history class to life by seeing those masterpieces up close and in perfect detail with <a href=""https://get.google.com/tips/#!/tips/study-and-compare-images-for-art-history?category=learn-better"">Cultural Institute</a>. <br />
<br />
We hope these give you new ideas for how you can make this school year your best yet. Over the next few weeks, we’ll be announcing more tips and other updates—so follow along with <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=GoogleEdu&amp;src=typd"">#GoogleEdu</a> and on <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+GoogleforEducation"">Google+</a>. We’ll be doing our homework to stick to our resolution, so we can hopefully give you what you need to do the same. Now go hit those books! <br />

And a third-party candidate we can all get behind. This week had a little of everything—read on for a look at the top topics on Google Search.<br />
<br />
<b>Top tabs</b><br />
Lieutenant Shaye Haver and Lieutenant Kristen Griest are the first women to break a major gender barrier and graduate from the rigorous Army Ranger School this week. The course is known for its <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/08/women-army-ranger-military/401984/"">tough physical challenges and a high dropout rate</a>, and this was the first year women were admitted. Search interest in Haver and Griest has spiked more than 150X since Tuesday; at today’s graduation, they earned their tabs—and a place in history.<br />
<br />
<b>This Presidential campaign is Nuts</b><br />
The Republican Presidential candidates continue to draw headlines in the long lead-up to the 2016 election. One of the top topics this week? Immigration, after Donald Trump said in an interview that he would overturn the law that grants citizenship to people born in the U.S.—a law better known as the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=14th+Amendment&amp;std=20150819&amp;pn=p1#a=20150819-14th+Amendment"">14th Amendment</a> to the U.S. Constitution. It didn’t take long for the other candidates to take a stand one way or the other on the “birthright citizenship” issue, while searchers turned to the web to learn more about the Amendment and the ongoing debate. In less political political news, Trump also drew ire this week when he said that supermodel <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Heidi+Klum&amp;std=20150818&amp;pn=p1#a=20150818-Heidi+Klum"">Heidi Klum</a>—a knockout at 42—was “no longer a 10.” More than 200,000 searches—and a <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/18/politics/donald-trump-heidi-klum-no-longer-a-ten/"">smart comeback</a> from Heidi—weren’t far behind.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, there’s a new presidential candidate on the scene in Iowa. A 15-year-old high school sophomore named Brady Olson made <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/08/20/deez-nuts-for-president-why-not-says-iowa-farm-boy/"">quite the splash</a> after he submitted his candidacy with the Federal Election Commission as “<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Deez+Nuts&amp;std=20150819&amp;pn=p1#a=20150819-Deez+Nuts"">Deez Nuts</a>.” Not only is he polling at a <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/19/presidential-candidate-deez-nuts-does-not-exist.html"">not-too-shabby 9 percent</a> against Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in North Carolina—Nuts was a trending topic on Twitter and he’s surpassed Clinton in search interest, too.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ul97BcMOyZQ/VdeLD5bWbhI/AAAAAAAAQzE/rC9sjTl5_YY/s1600/ClintonVsDeezNuts.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ul97BcMOyZQ/VdeLD5bWbhI/AAAAAAAAQzE/rC9sjTl5_YY/s500/ClintonVsDeezNuts.png"" width=""500"" /></a></div><b>Cheater, beware</b><br />
The cheating site Ashley Madison was a top trending term this week, after hackers stole user account and payment information and posted the data online. There were more than 1 million searches for [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Ashley+Madison&amp;std=20150818&amp;pn=p1#a=20150818-Ashley+Madison"">Ashley Madison</a>] on Tuesday, with more than half a million for [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Ashley+Madison+List&amp;std=20150819&amp;pn=p1#a=20150819-Ashley+Madison+List"">Ashley Madison List</a>] as people tried to find out whether someone they knew had a profile. But questions about the hacking were myriad, and sometimes innocent. Many wanted to know “who is Ashley Madison?” (spoiler: not a real person) while others asked “What is the dark web?” in an effort to find out more about the anonymous and hidden network where the data was released. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b8vIKLK_Jss/VdeLDyqIbyI/AAAAAAAAQzI/0RmXxuN1Zr0/s1600/AshleyMadison.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b8vIKLK_Jss/VdeLDyqIbyI/AAAAAAAAQzI/0RmXxuN1Zr0/s500/AshleyMadison.png"" width=""500"" /></a></div><b>Be careful what you wish for</b><br />
A new tourist attraction in the U.K. is already living up to its name. “Dismaland,” an art exhibit by the elusive Banksy, and ""the U.K.'s most disappointing new visitor attraction,” features a <a href=""http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2015/08/dismaland/"">derelict castle with a dirty moat</a>, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/20/arts/banksy-dismaland-art-exhibition/"">gloomy park attendants</a>, and bizarre works by <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/08/21/433476889/banksys-dismaland-living-up-to-its-name-with-ticket-debacle"">50+ artists</a>. After being shrouded in secrecy, the “bemusement park” debuted this week to the tune of <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Dismaland&amp;std=20150820&amp;pn=p1#a=20150820-Dismaland"">200,000+ searches</a>, and today search interest in Dismaland surpassed that of Disneyland’s. (One of searchers’ top questions: “What does Disney say about Dismaland?”) Unfortunately (or, appropriately, depending on your viewpoint), the park has also had its fair share of troubles already. As its website <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-34014623"">crashed</a> under the weight of 6 million hits, and hundreds of people lined up outside the resort, many are wondering whether they’re on their way to see a conceptual art work, or already a part of one.<br />

2914520161780470713,,Google Blogs,2015-08-18T09:16:00-07:00,Meet OnHub: a new router for a new way to Wi-Fi,"Ugh...not again. You get home at the end of the day, and sit down to stream a new movie or upload vacation photos — and your Wi-Fi slows to a crawl or just stops working. Instead of relaxing in front of the screen or sharing those photos with friends, you spend it unplugging and re-plugging cords, trying to decipher blinking lights, or contemplating a call to customer support. <br />
<br />
While we count on Wi-Fi more than ever to be entertained, productive, and stay connected, we’re streaming and sharing in new ways our old routers were never built to handle. So today, with our partner TP-LINK, we’re launching <a href=""http://on.google.com/hub"">OnHub</a>, a different kind of router for a new way to Wi-Fi. Instead of headaches and spotty connections, OnHub gives you Wi-Fi that’s fast, secure, and easy to use. <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/HNnfHP7VDP8"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
<br />
<b>Designed for the Home</b><br />
Many of us keep our router on the floor and out of sight, where it doesn’t work as well. We replaced unruly cords and blinking lights with internal antennas and subtle, useful lighting, so you’ll be happy placing OnHub out in the open, where your router performs its best. <br />
<br />
<b>Starts Fast, Stays Fast</b><br />
During setup, OnHub searches the airwaves and selects the best channel for the fastest connection. A unique antenna design and smart software keep working in the background, automatically adjusting OnHub to avoid interference and keep your network at peak performance. You can even prioritize a device, so that your most important activity —  like streaming your favorite show — gets the fastest speed.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hLBLNJS-Rrg/VdNL2FTbRuI/AAAAAAAAQxM/PP_ebhj1jrA/s1600/onhub%2Bblog.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" data-about-featured="""" height=""313"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hLBLNJS-Rrg/VdNL2FTbRuI/AAAAAAAAQxM/PP_ebhj1jrA/s640/onhub%2Bblog.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><div><br />
<b>A simple mobile app</b><br />
OnHub makes it simple to set up and manage your Wi-Fi, all from the Google On app, available on Android or iOS. The Google On app tells you how much bandwidth your devices are using, lets you run a network check, and if there’s an issue with your Wi-Fi, the app offers suggestions to help. And, instead of lost passwords and sticky notes, it even reveals your password with a single tap and lets you text or email it to friends. <br />
<br />
<b>Just gets better</b><br />
OnHub automatically updates with new features and the latest security upgrades, without interrupting your connection. In the future, OnHub can support smart devices that you bring into your home, whether they use Bluetooth® Smart Ready, Weave, or 802.15.4. We also plan to design new OnHub devices with other hardware partners in the future. Stay tuned for news from our second partner, ASUS, later this year. <br />
<br />
Starting today, OnHub is available for pre-order for $199.99 from <a href=""https://on.google.com/hub/#buy"">online retailers</a> in the U.S. including the Google Store, Amazon, and Walmart.com. It will be available for sale in retail stores in the U.S. and in Canada in the coming weeks. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, we want our Wi-Fi to just work, so that we can do all the things we love to do online. Here’s to Wi-Fi with the reliability, speed, and security you want at home, without the frustrations you don’t. <br />

<b>Per-see … what is it?</b><br />
As the skies lit up with the Perseid Meteor shower this week, there were more than a <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends"">million Google searches</a> around the topic from people on the hunt for shooting stars. Along with questions on how to pronounce it (that would be something in the region of “<a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/perseid-meteor-shower-when-is-it-how-do-i-photograph-it-and-how-do-you-even-pronounce-perseid-10452405.html"">percy-id</a>”), people were asking where to watch and how to photograph the summer show, with <a href=""https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/perseids.cfm"">NASA</a> promising up to a hundred meteors an hour if you got up early enough. These meteors streak through the Earth’s atmosphere for our viewing pleasure every year -- check out the annual <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=perseid&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B7"">spike in Google searches</a> over the last decade for a record of when we spotted them. <br />

<b>Headlines from China </b><br />
Shocking images of destruction continue to come out of China’s northern port city of Tianjin after a massive chemical explosion Wednesday. This eye-witness <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO1q3HwB0y0"">video</a> posted on YouTube by Daniel Van Duren -- who says he was watching for shooting stars when the explosions happened -- has more than 60,000 views in 24 hours.  With news outlets reporting that smoke is still rising from the industrial area where the blasts occurred, the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends"">million Google searches</a> about Tianjin are focused on the “who, what, where, when, why” of the disaster.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4Brp4zh6cOA/Vc5CqAxe0eI/AAAAAAAAQwc/GALJnorz40M/s1600/CMTblrwWsAUHHbu.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""320"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4Brp4zh6cOA/Vc5CqAxe0eI/AAAAAAAAQwc/GALJnorz40M/s640/CMTblrwWsAUHHbu.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><br />
This was the second time news from China appeared in the world’s <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends"">Hot Trends</a> this week. China’s surprise decision to devalue its currency prompted an additional 50,000 searches Tuesday.<br />
<br />
<b>Because there’s apparently a day for everything</b><br />
It was an awesome week for left-handed middle children everywhere. Wednesday was National Middle Child Day, where the top rising search on Google was for <a href=""http://www.gulflive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/08/national_middle_child_day_5_fu.html"">this meme</a>, which pretty much sums it up. Then Thursday was Left Handers Day, prompting a spike of more than <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends#"">100,000 Google searches</a>. Looking at the top questions asked on Google around this important day for southpaws, you all wanted to know how many people in general are left-handed, and how many US presidents in particular (hard to confirm, but the White House <a href=""https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/632016339285078016"">tweeted</a> that President Obama is one of them). Which brings us, naturally, to the next burning question on people’s minds: “Is Donald Trump left-handed?”  File that one under “August.”<br />

5960578054368697454,,Google Blogs,2015-08-10T13:41:00-07:00,G is for Google,"As Sergey and I wrote in the original founders letter 11 years ago, “Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.”  As part of that, we also said that you could expect us to make “smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses.” From the start, we’ve always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have. <br />
<br />
We did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time. Many of those crazy things now have over a billion users, like Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. And we haven’t stopped there.  We are still trying to do things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about.<br />
<br />
We’ve long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes. But in the technology industry, where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas, you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant.<br />
<br />
Our company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable. So we are creating a new company, called <a href=""http://abc.xyz/"">Alphabet</a> (<a href=""https://abc.xyz/"">http://abc.xyz)</a>.  I am really excited to be running Alphabet as CEO with help from my capable partner, Sergey, as President.<br />
<br />
What is Alphabet?  Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies.  The largest of which, of course, is Google.   This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead.  What do we mean by far afield?  Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences (that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens), and <a href=""http://www.calicolabs.com/"">Calico</a> (focused on longevity).  Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren’t very related. Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence. In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed. We will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well.  We'll also make sure we have a great CEO for each business, and we’ll determine their compensation.  In addition, with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results, where Google financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of Alphabet businesses as a whole.<br />
<br />
This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google.  A key part of this is Sundar Pichai. Sundar has been saying the things I would have said (and sometimes better!) for quite some time now, and I’ve been tremendously enjoying our work together. He has really stepped up since October of last year, when he took on product and engineering responsibility for our Internet businesses.  Sergey and I have been super excited about his progress and dedication to the company.  And it is clear to us and our board that it is time for Sundar to be CEO of Google.  I feel very fortunate to have someone as talented as he is to run the slightly slimmed down Google and this frees up time for me to continue to scale our aspirations.  I have been spending quite a bit of time with Sundar, helping him and the company in any way I can, and I will of course continue to do that.  Google itself is also making all sorts of new products, and I know Sundar will always be focused on innovation -- continuing to stretch boundaries.  I know he deeply cares that we can continue to make big strides on our core mission to organize the world's information.  Recent launches like Google Photos and Google Now using machine learning are amazing progress.  Google also has some services that are run with their own identity, like YouTube.  Susan is doing a great job as CEO, running a strong brand and driving incredible growth.<br />
<br />
Sergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things.  Alphabet will also include our X lab, which incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery effort<a href=""http://hooli.xyz/"" style=""text-decoration: none;"">.</a> We are also stoked about growing our investment arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure.<br />
<br />
Alphabet Inc. will replace Google Inc. as the publicly-traded entity and all shares of Google will automatically convert into the same number of shares of Alphabet, with all of the same rights.  Google will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet.  Our two classes of shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq as GOOGL and GOOG.    <br />
<br />
For Sergey and me this is a very exciting new chapter in the life of Google -- the birth of Alphabet. We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search!  We also like that it means alpha-bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!  I should add that we are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related products--the whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands.<br />
<br />
We are excited about…<br />
<ul><li>Getting more ambitious things done.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Taking the long-term view.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Investing at the scale of the opportunities and resources we see.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Improving the transparency and oversight of what we’re doing.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Making Google even better through greater focus.&nbsp;</li>
<li>And hopefully...as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can.</li>
</ul>What could be better?  No wonder we are excited to get to work with everyone in the Alphabet family.  Don’t worry, we’re still getting used to the name too!<br />

With 10 candidates on stage for the prime-time event, Thursday night’s <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_pMFd-k4BAAC3uM_en"">Republican presidential debate</a> debate did seem quite a bit like a party.

<br />
<br />
Not surprisingly, the candidates themselves generated some serious search action. Donald Trump claimed the “most searched” position in the <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/629490415180210176"">days before and hours after</a> the event, and held on to the spot for nearly all of the debate itself, save a few appearances from Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina and Lindsey Graham.<br />

Just open the app, click on the camera, and point it at the text you need to translate—a street sign, ingredient list, instruction manual, dials on a washing machine. You'll see the text transform live on your screen into the other language. No Internet connection or cell phone data needed. <br />
<br />
Today, we’re updating the Google Translate app again—expanding instant visual translation to 20 more languages (for a total of 27!), and making real-time voice translations a lot faster and smoother—so even more people can experience the world in their language.<br />

<br />
We <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/01/hallo-hola-ola-more-powerful-translate.html"">started out</a> with seven languages—English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish—and today we're adding 20 more. You can now translate to and from English and Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Filipino, Finnish, Hungarian, Indonesian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Slovak, Swedish, Turkish and Ukrainian. You can also do one-way translations from English to Hindi and Thai. (Or, try snapping a pic of the text you’d like translated—we have a total of 37 languages in camera mode.)<br />
<br />
To try out the new languages, go to the Google Translate app, set “English” along with the language you’d like to translate, and click the camera button; you'll be prompted to download a small (~2 MB) language pack for each.  <br />
<br />
Ready to see all of these languages in action?<br />

<br />
And how exactly did we get so many new languages running on a device with no data connection? It’s all about convolutional neural networks (whew)—geek out on that over on our <a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/07/how-google-translate-squeezes-deep.html"">Research blog</a>.<br />

<b>Have a natural, smoother conversation—even with a slower mobile network</b><br />
In many emerging markets, slow mobile networks can make it challenging to access many online tools - so if you live in an area with unreliable mobile networks, our other update today is for you. In addition to instant visual translation, we’ve also improved our voice conversation mode (enabling real-time translation of conversations across 32 languages), so it’s even faster and more natural on slow networks.<br />

On top of today’s updates, we’re also continuously working to improve the quality of the translations themselves and to add new languages. A year ago this week, we launched <a href=""https://translate.google.com/community?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=four_point_o"">Translate Community</a>, a place for multilingual people from anywhere in the world to provide and correct translations. Thanks to the millions of language lovers who have already pitched in—more than 100 million words so far!—<a href=""http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2015/06/google-translate-keeps-getting-better.html"">we've been updating our translations</a> for over 90 language pairs, and plan to update many more as our community grows.<br />
<br />
We’ve still got lots of work to do: more than half of the content on the Internet is in English, but only around 20% of the world’s population speaks English. Today’s updates knock down a few more language barriers, helping you communicate better and get the information you need.<br />

Here’s more about what you can expect:<br />
<br />
<b>A more focused Google+ experience</b><br />
Google+ is quickly becoming a place where people engage around their shared interests, with the content and people who inspire them. In line with that focus, we’re continuing to add new features like <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+DmitryShapiro/posts/B4M3R6aMkEf?e=-RedirectToSandbox"">Google+ Collections</a>, where you can share and enjoy posts organized by the topics you care about. At the same time, we’ll also move some features that aren’t essential to an interest-based social experience out of Google+.  For example, many elements of Google+ Photos have been moved into the new Google Photos app, and we’re well underway putting location sharing into Hangouts and other apps, where it really belongs. We think changes like these will lead to a more focused, more useful, more engaging Google+.<br />
<br />
<b>Using Google without a Google+ profile</b><br />
People have told us that accessing all of their Google stuff with one account makes life a whole lot easier. But we’ve also heard that it doesn’t make sense for your Google+ profile to be your identity in all the other Google products you use.<br />
<br />
So in the coming months, a Google Account will be all you’ll need to share content, communicate with contacts, create a YouTube channel and more, all across Google. YouTube will be one of the first products to make this change, and you can learn more <a href=""http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2015/07/youtube-comments.html"">on their blog</a>. As always, your underlying Google Account won’t be searchable or followable, unlike public Google+ profiles. And for people who already created Google+ profiles but don’t plan to use Google+ itself, we’ll offer better options for managing and removing those public profiles.<br />
<br />
You’ll see these changes roll out in stages over several months.  While they won’t happen overnight, they’re right for Google’s users—both the people who are on Google+ every single day, and the people who aren’t.<br />

6595431200387354505,,Google Blogs,2015-07-27T08:23:00-07:00,Rising to the climate challenge,"In less than five months, policymakers from around the world will gather in Paris to finalize a new global agreement on combating climate change. Already, many governments are putting forth ambitious emissions reduction goals. And companies are taking action, too, by reducing their own footprints and investing in clean energy.<br />
<br />
<div>Reaching a strong deal in Paris is an absolute and urgent necessity. The data is clear and the science is beyond dispute: a warming planet poses enormous threats to society. <br />
<br />
Public health experts recently <a href=""http://press.thelancet.com/Climate2Commission.pdf"">warned </a>that climate change threatens to “undermine the last half century of gains in development and global health,” through forces like extreme weather, drought, malnutrition, and disease. The U.S. government has asserted that climate change poses “immediate risks to U.S. national security,” as increased natural disasters and humanitarian crises fuel instability and violence. And many studies have revealed that critical infrastructure, like electricity and water, is vulnerable to rising sea levels and intensifying storms.</div><div><br />
Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time. Rising to that challenge involves a complex mix of policy, technology, and international cooperation. This won’t be easy, but Google is committed to doing its part.<br />
<br />
Google has been carbon neutral since 2007. Our data centers, the physical infrastructure behind web services used by billions of people, now get 3.5 times the computing power out of the same amount of electricity, as compared to five years ago. We are also the <a href=""https://www.sustainablepurchasing.org/summit15/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/06/Summit_2015_Presentation_Slides_Touati_Herve_SPLC-Summit_2015.pdf"">biggest</a> corporate purchaser of renewable power on the planet. Just today at the White House, <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fthe-press-office%2F2015%2F07%2F27%2Ffact-sheet-white-house-launches-american-business-act-climate-pledge&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGojwY7JSNOgW4qZA0CVVhAU-dDXA"">we pledged to triple those purchases</a> over the next decade. In addition, we're a major climate-minded investor, so far committing more than $2 billion to clean energy projects, from America’s largest wind farm to Africa’s largest solar power plant. </div><div><br />
We're serious about environmental sustainability not because it’s trendy, but because it’s core to our values and also makes good business sense. After all, the cheapest energy is the energy you don’t use in the first place. And in many places clean power is cost-competitive with conventional power.<br />
<br />
We’re making progress, but averting catastrophic climate change will require significant investment and bold innovations. Google and our private-sector peers are ready to lead. But something fundamental is required: clear policy. The global business community needs certainty to bring climate solutions to scale. We need the world’s political leaders to confirm that investments in clean energy are sound, and that the laws and policies meant to enable such investment will be designed for the long term and rooted in what science tells us needs to be done.<br />
<br />
It’s encouraging to see the world’s major economies set ambitious climate targets, but it’s time to get a strong international climate agreement on the books. This December in Paris, it’s imperative that policymakers reach a deal that moves us toward a zero-carbon economy. That’s the kind of future that we’re committed to helping build, and that future generations deserve. <br />

<br />
<b>Bad Blood</b><br />
Phew, where to start with this one. Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj had a spat over VMA nominations (Taylor was<a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=video%20of%20the%20year%202015""> nominated for Video of the Year</a>; Nicki was not), worked through it and made up -- all on Twitter. It was a good lesson in the art of the<a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=subtweet""> subtweet</a>, as well as the “sincere apology after responding to a subtweet that wasn’t directly about you” tweet. <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Nicki+Minaj&amp;std=20150721&amp;pn=p1#a=20150721-Nicki+Minaj"">Searches about the incident</a> topped 500,000.<br />
<br />
But Minaj v. Swift wasn’t the only music-related drama to make the list of Trending Searches. Meek Mill, hip hop artist and Nicki Minaj’s significant other, <a href=""http://time.com/3967466/meek-mill-drake/"">started a Twitter rant</a> of his own, alleging that rapper Drake doesn’t write his own material and inspiring more than<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Meek+Mill&amp;std=20150721&amp;pn=p1#a=20150721-Meek+Mill""> a million searches</a>. The two artists haven’t settled up yet, so stay tuned for more on that front.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, country stars Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert are calling it quits after four years of marriage and guess what — they both<a href=""http://tasteofcountry.com/blake-shelton-miranda-lambert-tweet-to-one-another-after-divorce/""> had stuff to say</a> about it on Twitter.

<br />
<b>But wait, there’s more</b><br />
It was the week of the sequel. (The weequel?) James Bond is back -- the trailer for the upcoming “Spectre” was released this week, which got more than 100,000 people searching for the movie. And nearly as surprising as the idea of a shark-filled tornado itself, the Sharknado is back. “Sharknado 3” -- featuring 90s all-stars Tara Reid and Ian Ziering -- aired on Wednesday night and pulled in a <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Sharknado+3&amp;date=now+7-d&amp;geo=US"">cool 500,000 searches</a>.<br />

7069824243381511967,,Google Blogs,2015-07-24T13:34:00-07:00,Five ways we’re celebrating the Special Olympics and #ADA25,"<i>""Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt."" -Special Olympics Athlete Oath</i><br />
<br />
Standing in Soldier Field in Chicago, 47 years ago, Eunice Shriver kicked off the first Special Olympics in history--1,000 people with intellectual disabilities from the U.S. and Canada competed in track &amp; field, swimming and diving. Even though it was a small inaugural event, its historical impact--giving a platform to the civil rights struggles of people with disabilities that were so often overlooked-- was massive. The Games were meant to give children with cognitive disabilities, in Eunice’s words,  “the chance to play, the chance to compete and the chance to grow.” <br />
<br />
Ambitious, inclusive thinking like Eunice’s is contagious, and has inspired us to support this year’s Special Olympics World Games as part of the <a href=""http://get.google.com/disabilitiesimpactchallenge/"">Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities.</a> Launched in May, this effort is focused on supporting the development of assistive technologies for people with disabilities around the world with<a href=""//googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/google-impact-challenge-disabilities.html""> $20 million in Google.org grants.</a> This weekend, to mark the Games as well as the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, landmark legislation that advanced the civil rights of people with disabilities when it was signed into law in 1990, we’re honoring the community in the following ways:<br />

This post comes to us from Sylvia Earle, marine biologist and Explorer-in-Residence at National Geographic and the host of the first week of Camp Google. Tune in to Sylvia’s <a href=""https://camp.withgoogle.com/?utm_source=googleblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=google"">live event at 12 p.m. PT</a> today</i>. -Ed.<br />
<br />
The ocean first got my attention during a family visit to a New Jersey beach when I was three years old—a wave knocked me over! At age 12, a move to the Florida coast made the ocean my backyard, and I loved the abundance of life there—every day I encountered new creatures like starfish, sponges, horseshoe crabs, seaweed, and a wondrous array of small fish that I’d never seen before. I knew from then on that when I grew up I would be a scientist so I could keep exploring, no matter what.<br />
<br />
Now I get to share my love for the ocean with a new generation of adventurers as part of Camp Google, a new online camp for curious kids, starting. During each of the four weeks of Camp Google, kids 7-10 can explore different subjects by joining live adventures—from the depths of the Atlantic to the top of one of the world’s most active volcanoes—and doing fun science projects. Today at 12 p.m. PT, National Geographic diver Erika Bergman and I will take kids on the first adventure—a <a href=""http://camp.withgoogle.com/?utm_source=googleblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=google"">live dive</a> in the Atlantic Ocean. We’ll head to the northernmost part of Florida Reef Tract, the most extensive living coral reef system in North America. Whether it be the Hammerhead Reef or shipwrecks like the Jay Scutti, it will be exciting to see what we’ll find down there!<br />
<br />
After the dive, kids can get hands-on with a range of activities to help them understand the science behind what they’ve seen underwater. The activities are designed by the Google engineers who map the oceans with Google Earth, and can be done with simple household supplies. For example, we’ll <a href=""https://camp.withgoogle.com/activities/week1/why-do-some-things-float?utm_source=googleblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=google"">learn about buoyancy</a> and how things float in the ocean in an experiment with eggs, water and salt, and we’ll explore how dolphins use sounds to see underwater by <a href=""https://camp.withgoogle.com/activities/week1/how-do-dolphins-see-underwater?utm_source=googleblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=google"">building a sonar system</a>. As kids complete these projects, they’ll earn camp badges to celebrate the new skills they learned, like conquering echolocation (not bad for summer vacation!). The activities are designed for kids to do on their own, in groups with their friends, or with their families. <br />
<br />
Following Ocean Week, kids can jump into Space Week with a NASA astronaut and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce"">VSauce</a> where they will help cook up space food and learn how astronauts eat in space. After that, they’ll head to Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park with a National Park Ranger and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium"">Derek Muller</a> to learn more about how volcanoes form. And camp ends in style with Music Week, where kids can jam alongside <a href=""http://zendaya.com/"">Zendaya</a> to learn about why music makes us want to bust a move. We hosts can't wait to explore with you this summer, wherever you might be!<br />

The ocean is vast and a lot of it is unexplored—every time I dive into the ocean there’s the possibility of finding something new. I’m excited to share this spirit of discovery with kids everywhere this summer. I hope through our dive and the rest of Camp Google, we can inspire kids to continue asking questions... and get out there to find answers. <br />

815520418145634327,,Google Blogs,2015-07-10T16:33:00-07:00,Through the Google lens: Search trends July 3-9,"This week people had the goal of searching for info on the U.S. victory in the Women’s World Cup, as well as a hat trick of technical difficulties at three major organizations. Let’s kick off the trending topics on Google this week:<br />
<br />
<b>Victory for the U.S. women</b><br />
The U.S. Women’s National team claimed a 5-2 victory over Japan in the final of the World Cup this week, and took home a slew of searches along with their trophy. In fact, U.S. search interest in the final match surpassed interest in Game 6 of this year’s NBA Finals! Keeper <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Hope+Solo&amp;std=20150705&amp;pn=p1#a=20150705-Hope+Solo"">Hope Solo</a> and forward <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Alex+Morgan&amp;std=20150705&amp;pn=p1#a=20150705-Alex+Morgan"">Alex Morgan</a> topped the trends charts on Sunday with more than 1 million and 500,000+ searches, respectively. But people were also interested in <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=carli%20lloyd&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B7"">midfielder Carli Lloyd</a>, who scored a hat trick in the final, including one goal from midfield that sent searches for “carli lloyd goal” spiking more than 1,000 percent. The team was honored with a <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=ticker+tape+parade&amp;std=20150710&amp;pn=p1#a=20150710-ticker+tape+parade"">ticker-tape parade</a> in New York City today. <br />
<br />
<b>Ground to a halt</b><br />
Wednesday, a slew of technical issues caused trouble across the U.S., starting with United Airlines. A network outage grounded planes for more than an hour, affecting <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/08/news/companies/united-flights-grounded-computer/index.html"">almost 5,000 flights</a>, and frustrated travelers turned to Google to learn more, making the airline the top searched term on Wednesday with <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=United+Airlines&amp;std=20150708&amp;pn=p1#a=20150708-United+Airlines"">more than 1 million searches</a>. Meanwhile, trading was suspended for hours at the New York Stock Exchange after a software glitch. Top questions during the outage included “How many times has the NYSE closed?” and “When was the last time the NYSE suspended trading?” Completing the triumvirate of tech troubles, the Wall Street Journal’s website crashed this week as well. The (sort of?) good news is that the three incidents seem to be unrelated to each other—or to hackers.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RBWWKID6XTw/VaBTxlheKnI/AAAAAAAAQqA/NtRWSqNezpY/s1600/NYSE.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RBWWKID6XTw/VaBTxlheKnI/AAAAAAAAQqA/NtRWSqNezpY/s550/NYSE.png"" width=""550"" /></a></div>From plane delays to train delays: In the U.K. Thursday, a strike by London Underground workers caused the first complete shutdown of the Tube in over a decade. As Londoners trudged home or crowded into buses, searchers asked “How much do tube drivers earn?” The strike was over a failed agreement about pay and a new “night Tube” service scheduled to start running in September.<br />
<br />
<b>Comic-Con</b><br />
The annual Comic-Con International started yesterday, bringing comic, superhero and sci-fi fans together in San Diego, Calif. for a long weekend of panels, events and other celebrations of all things (proud) nerd. The top Comic-Con topics this week include “Doctor Who” and the new “Black Ops III: Zombies” video game, but there are <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8910817/sdcc-2015-dates-event-schedule"">movie trailers and TV show previews</a> to appeal to even the least geeky among us. A new clip from the final installment in the “Hunger Games” movie franchise drew <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Mockingjay+Part+2&amp;std=20150708&amp;pn=p1#a=20150708-Mockingjay+Part+2"">50,000+ searches</a>, while the new trailer for the live-action <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Goosebumps+Movie&amp;std=20150708&amp;pn=p1#a=20150708-Goosebumps+Movie"">“Goosebumps” movie</a> coming next year has already garnered <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cn716jv61s"">more than 6 million views</a> on YouTube. <br />

3833280709484818439,,Google Blogs,2015-06-29T08:45:00-07:00,Google Earth turns 10 today,"When Google Earth was <a href=""http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2005/06/google-launches-free-3d-mapping-and_28.html"">first introduced</a> 10 years ago, it immediately stole my heart. Beyond the freedom to fly anywhere in the world, I was captivated by the ability to paint and visualize geographic data on this incredible global canvas.<br />
<br />
Drawn to datasets backed by <a href=""https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/dcas/pages/casualties.xhtml"">real</a> <a href=""http://www.missingkids.com/search"">human</a> <a href=""http://www.archives.gov/research/alic/reference/military/japanese-internment.html"">stories</a>, I started making my own maps with <a href=""https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kml_tut"">KML</a> a few weeks after Earth’s release in 2005. For my master’s degree, I used Google Earth to build a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTsDmg2ye6c"">virtual representation</a> of a high-tech biological <a href=""http://nrs.ucop.edu/research/special_projects/SP2-Embedded-Sensing.htm"">research reserve</a>. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf"">Vint Cerf</a> saw my work, which eventually led to a job on the <a href=""http://www.google.com/earth/outreach/index.html"">Google Earth Outreach</a> team, turning my passion for telling stories with maps into a career.<br />
<br />
2005 was the beginning of Google Earth’s evolution, as well. In August of that year, <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/katrina_google.html"">Hurricane Katrina</a> showed us how useful mapping tools like Earth could be for <a href=""https://www.google.org/crisisresponse/"">crisis response efforts</a>. Rescue workers compared before and after Satellite imagery in Google Earth to better locate where people were stranded. And in the years after, with more than 2 billion downloads by people in nearly every country in the world, Earth has enabled people to discover <a href=""http://www.theage.com.au/news/technology/desktop-darwins-discovery/2008/02/12/1202760264915.html"">new coral reefs</a>, journey to the <a href=""http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2009/07/fly-yourself-to-moon.html"">Moon</a> and into <a href=""http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2007/08/introducing-sky-in-google-earth_22.html"">deep space</a>, find <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/10/a-long-way-home-with-help-from-google.html"">long-lost  parents</a>, <a href=""http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2012/06/halo-trust-uses-google-earth-to-help.html"">clear landmines</a> and <a href=""http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2015/06/ten-years-of-amazing-google-earth-visualizations.html"">much more</a>.<br />

The ability to empower groups as diverse as <a href=""http://www.googlelittrips.com/GoogleLit/Home.html"">school children</a> and <a href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/?eocn=topnav&amp;eoci=features"">NASA scientists</a> to learn more about the world is what I love about Google Earth. It has the potential to make the planet a far more connected place, if you take the time to explore, discover and share what you learn. So to celebrate how far Google Earth has come and our leap into the next 10 years, we’ve created a few new ways to help you better see places from around (and above) the world.<br />
<br />
<b>Voyager</b><br />
The world is a big place, and it can be hard to know where to begin your virtual journey. Now you can jump straight to the newest and most interesting imagery around the globe with a new layer, Voyager, available in desktop versions of Google Earth.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1gLxYvmlUxQ/VZFkIDX7JYI/AAAAAAAAQpA/fIuk0RnJ9-s/s1600/voyager.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;""><img border=""0"" height=""316"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1gLxYvmlUxQ/VZFkIDX7JYI/AAAAAAAAQpA/fIuk0RnJ9-s/s640/voyager.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i>Different imagery types in Voyager are shown by color</i></div><br />
In this first edition of <i>Voyager</i>, you’ll find five sections to explore:<br />
<ul><li><b>Street View:</b> highlights from Street View, including the Taj Mahal and the Grand Canyon</li>
<li><b>Earth View: </b>striking landscapes around the globe as seen from space (more below)</li>
<li><b>3D cities: </b>a showcase of cities and towns available in photorealistic 3D (<a href=""https://support.google.com/earth/answer/176674"">don’t forget to tilt!</a>)</li>
<li><b>Satellite imagery updates:</b> a map of our most recently published satellite imagery</li>

<b>Earth View</b><br />
Looking at our planet from above is not only a reminder of how interdependent our human and natural ecosystems are—it also lays bare the Earth’s staggering and often surreal beauty.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JiNRwcKJDoI/VZFkD3o_3lI/AAAAAAAAQoo/I52PUNHFr8E/s1600/Google-Chrome-Extension-Store-01-Plain.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""400"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JiNRwcKJDoI/VZFkD3o_3lI/AAAAAAAAQoo/I52PUNHFr8E/s640/Google-Chrome-Extension-Store-01-Plain.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i>The Hammar Marshes of Iran are an uncharacteristic yet beautiful wetland feature in the otherwise arid climate</i></div><br />
Earth View is library of some of the most striking and enigmatic landscapes available in Google Earth. It started as a 20 percent project last year by a few Googlers who enjoyed scouring satellite imagery for these gems. These images soon made their way onto Android phones, Chromecast and Chromebooks as a distinctive kind of wallpaper.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yEVrufQsJHE/VZFkD1wWojI/AAAAAAAAQos/ZBhUecwcgRM/s1600/Google-Chrome-Extension-Store-03-Sharing.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img data-about-featured border=""0"" height=""400"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yEVrufQsJHE/VZFkD1wWojI/AAAAAAAAQos/ZBhUecwcgRM/s640/Google-Chrome-Extension-Store-03-Sharing.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i>Islands surrounding Cuba seen in the Earth View <a href=""http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/earth-view-from-google-ma/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh"">Chrome Extension</a></i></div><br />
For Earth's 10th birthday, we're expanding the Earth View collection to 1,500 landscapes from every continent and ocean and making it accessible to even more people. The new imagery is available with an updated version of our <a href=""http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/earth-view-from-google-ma/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh"">Chrome extension</a> and a new <a href=""http://earthview.withgoogle.com/"">web gallery</a>. Download high-resolution wallpapers for your mobile and desktop devices, or better yet, print them up for your walls!<br />

Thank you for the last 10 years exploring your world with Google Earth. We hope <i>Voyager</i> and <i>Earth View</i> will unlock a new perspective on our planet. We look forward to seeing what the next decade brings! <br />

<br />
<b>#LoveWins</b><br />
Whether the query was “<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Marriage+Equality&amp;std=20150626&amp;pn=p1#a=20150626-Marriage+Equality"">marriage equality</a>,” “<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=14th+Amendment&amp;std=20150626&amp;pn=p1#a=20150626-14th+Amendment"">fourteenth amendment</a>,” or “love wins,” searches related to today’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that same-sex couples nationwide have a right to marry are <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_PjmPKE4BAAD_kM_en"">spiking</a>, with more than 2 million searches for the term “gay marriage” alone. Interest goes beyond the U.S., with “What countries allow same-sex marriage?” and “where is gay marriage legal?” among the top questions.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Z_b-X7hzp8E/VY3TJXMAoCI/AAAAAAAAQoE/z3QX1eWVqR4/s1600/LGBT.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""320"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Z_b-X7hzp8E/VY3TJXMAoCI/AAAAAAAAQoE/z3QX1eWVqR4/s640/LGBT.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><br />
While today’s “<a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/supreme-court-gay-marriage-obama-twitter-119464.html"">thunderbolt</a>” ruling is capturing most of the attention around SCOTUS, searches for the court have in fact been big all week. Yesterday, news that the Court had upheld a key portion of the <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_fMiTKE4BAAChYM_en"">Affordable Care Act</a> was met with a 200,000+ search spike, and renewed questions like “How does Obamacare work?” and “Why do Republicans dislike Obamacare?” <br />
<br />
<b>Confederate flag</b><br />
We noted last week that searches related to the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Confederate+flag&amp;std=20150622&amp;pn=p1#a=20150622-Confederate+flag"">Confederate flag</a> increased sharply following the tragic shooting in Charleston, S.C.; and this week, interest in the flag reached an all-time high. Searches were most concentrated in <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=confederate%20flag&amp;geo=US&amp;date=now%207-d&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B7"">South Carolina</a>, where Governor Nikki Haley has called for the flag’s removal from the state Capitol, followed by Alabama, where Governor Robert Bentley ordered the flag’s removal from the Capitol grounds. But searches have been popular throughout the South as people ask questions like “Is the confederate flag racist” and “How many states fly the Confederate flag?” As companies pulled Confederate flag merchandise from their sites and stores, the search terms “confederate for sale” spiked <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=confederate%20flag&amp;geo=US&amp;date=now%207-d&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B7"">more than 1,000 percent</a>.<br />

<b>Rising stars</b><br />
Thursday’s 2015 N.B.A. Draft also attracted <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=NBA+Draft&amp;std=20150625&amp;pn=p1#a=20150625-NBA+Draft"">more than 2 million searches</a> this week and half of the top 20 searches yesterday, with queries for first pick <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F0pb65ks"">Karl-Anthony Towns</a> spiking more than 1,000 percent. Looks like Minnesota Timberwolves fans had done their research ahead of the selection; Towns was the <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/614217438960467968"">most-searched prospect in the state</a> ahead of the draft. Other breakout names of the week included actor <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Tom+Holland&amp;std=20150622&amp;pn=p1#a=20150622-Tom+Holland"">Tom Holland</a>, who saw 500,000+ searches after he was cast as Spider-Man for the next film in the Marvel franchise. Holland’s home country of the U.K. topped the list of countries looking for details, but Spidey searches from people in the Philippines to the Netherlands show the global popularity of this character, even two years before the movie’s <a href=""http://variety.com/interstitial/"">2017 release</a>. &nbsp; <br />

8069847387540546049,,Google Blogs,2015-06-24T11:00:00-07:00,A power plant for the Internet: our newest data center in Alabama,"Every time you check your Gmail, search on Google for a nearby restaurant, or watch a YouTube video, a server whirs to life in one of our data centers. Data centers are the engines of the Internet, bringing the power of the web to millions of people around the world. And as millions more people come online, our data centers are growing, too.<br />
<br />
We’ve recently expanded our data centers in <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2015/04/16/google-reportedly-investing-additional-1b-in-giant-iowa-data-center/"">Iowa</a>, <a href=""http://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/google-invests-in-300m-expansion-of-douglas-county/nmS4y/"">Georgia</a>, <a href=""http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.com/2015/06/growing-our-data-center-in-singapore.html"">Singapore</a> and <a href=""http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;u=http://www.bloovi.be/nieuws/detail/google-datacenter-draagt-900-miljoen-bij-aan-belgische-economie&amp;sandbox=0&amp;usg=ALkJrhgVEf9bQ8sswO_XIBC3j5uIfCoOnQ"">Belgium</a>. And today we’re announcing <a href=""http://google.com/jacksoncounty"">a new data center</a> in Alabama—our 14th site globally.<br />
<br />
This time, we’re doing something we’ve never done before: we’ll be building on the grounds of the <a href=""http://www.tva.com/sites/widowscreek.htm"">Widows Creek coal power plant</a> in Jackson County, which has been scheduled for shutdown. Data centers need a lot of infrastructure to run 24/7, and there’s a lot of potential in redeveloping large industrial sites like former coal power plants. Decades of investment shouldn’t go to waste just because a site has closed; we can repurpose existing electric and other infrastructure to make sure our data centers are reliably serving our users around the world.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2pxy0kA2_ds/VYrhuspl1yI/AAAAAAAAQm4/8FBix3zWsoI/s1600/AL%2Bphoto%2B1.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img data-about-featured border=""0"" height=""445"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2pxy0kA2_ds/VYrhuspl1yI/AAAAAAAAQm4/8FBix3zWsoI/s640/AL%2Bphoto%2B1.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></div>At Widows Creek, we can use the plants’ many electric transmission lines to bring in lots of renewable energy to power our new data center. Thanks to an arrangement with Tennessee Valley Authority, our electric utility, we’ll be able to scout new renewable energy projects and work with TVA to bring the power onto their electrical grid. Ultimately, this contributes to our goal of being powered by 100% renewable energy.<br />
<br />
In 2010, we were one of the first companies outside of the utility industry to <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/reducing-our-carbon-footprint-with.html"">buy large amounts of renewable energy</a>. Since then, we’ve become the largest corporate renewable energy purchaser in the world (in fact we’ve bought the equivalent of over <a href=""http://www.greenbiz.com/article/beyond-google-and-apple-whats-holding-corporate-renewables-back"">1.5 percent of the installed wind power capacity in the U.S.</a>). We're glad to see this trend is <a href=""http://www.rmi.org/Content/Files/2015_04_13_BNEF_Presentation_by_Herve_Touati.pdf"">catching on</a> among other companies.<br />
<br />
Of course, the cleanest energy is the energy you don’t use. Our Alabama data center will incorporate our state-of-the-art energy efficiency technologies. We’ve built our own <a href=""http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/efficiency/internal/#servers"">super-efficient servers</a>, invented <a href=""http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/efficiency/internal/#water-and-cooling"">more efficient ways to cool our data centers</a>, and even used advanced <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/better-data-centers-through-machine.html"">machine learning</a> to squeeze more out of every watt of power we consume. Compared to five years ago, we now get 3.5 times the computing power out of the same amount of energy.<br />
<br />
Since the 1960s, Widows Creek has generated power for the region—now the site will be used to power Internet services and bring information to people around the world. We expect to begin construction early next year and look forward to bringing a Google data center to Alabama.<br />

“That is awesome. I definitely have to be a part of that.” <br />
<br />
Maybe it was the sheer exhaustion from being in the middle of a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/sports/el-capitans-dawn-wall-climbers-reach-top.html"">19-day climb of the Dawn Wall</a>, but when the guys at Google Maps and <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm"">Yosemite National Park</a> asked if I wanted to help them with their <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@37.729095,-119.636477,3a,90y,54.5h,46.62t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sChhPgowc3CkAAAQqZe0Geg!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656"">first-ever vertical Street View collection of El Capitan in Yosemite</a>, I didn’t hesitate. Yosemite has been such an important part of my life that telling the story of El Capitan through Street View was right up my alley—especially when it meant working with the Google engineers to figure out some absurd challenges. <br />

</div>Climbing is all about flirting with the impossible and pushing the boundaries of what you think you can be done. Capturing <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@37.730029,-119.636392,3a,75y,240.76h,1t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sgskNYa2g8_sAAAQqZe0Ggw!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656"">Street View imagery 3,000 feet up El Capitan</a> proved to be an extension of that, especially when you take a camera meant for the inside of a restaurant and mount it thousands of feet up the world’s most iconic rock wall.<br />

Doing anything thousands of feet high on a sheer granite face is complicated, but everyone up there had spent years of their lives on a rope and knew exactly what they were doing.

<br />
Once we figured out how to keep the camera on El Cap, we created two sets of vertical Street View.

Lynn Hill’s ascent of El Capitan changed the paradigm of climbing, and she had an extraordinary effect on my climbing career. I’ll never forget when she became the first person, man or woman, to free-climb (using only her hands and feet) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nose_(El_Capitan)"">“The Nose”</a> back in 1993. Now, you can see her navigate these epic moves— like climbing sideways on tiny holds of the <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@37.729014,-119.636547,3a,75y,113.35h,40.09t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sCg1Rcf8h2wIAAAQqZe0GeQ!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656"">Jardine Traverse</a>, inventing a “Houdini” maneuver on the  <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@37.729964,-119.636383,3a,90y,43.69h,1t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sCw5RUbnMQJMAAAQqZe0Ggg!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656"">Changing Corners</a> and traversing under the <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@37.729847,-119.636377,3a,90y,252.17h,86.76t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1shE9PFK4uiU0AAAQqZe0Gfw!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656"">Great Roof</a>.<br />

Any story of El Capitan had to include my good friend Alex Honnold. He holds the speed record for climbing the Nose at 2 hours and 23 minutes - most people take 3-5 days. His unwavering confidence in himself is contagious; when I’m with him, I feel like the mountain has shrunk to half its size. As you make your way around Yosemite in Street View, you’ll see Alex doing what he does best: chimneying up the “<a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@37.729235,-119.63652,3a,75y,77.38h,89.45t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1smA_o-n74Vh8AAAQqZe0GfA!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656"">Texas Flake,</a>” racing up the <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@37.730077,-119.636387,3a,90y,278.65h,55.76t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sMAndSgN2PIUAAAQqZe0GhA!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656"">bolt ladder</a>, or getting dinner ready in the <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@37.724248,-119.635349,3a,90y,164.55h,79.6t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sTyBITgDyDkIAAAQqZe0Gcw!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656"">solar-powered van</a> he calls home.  <br />

I spent some of my rest days during my January climb of the Dawn Wall testing out the Street View technology the Google team had sent me that month.

Then, we really put Alex to work to collect the second set of Street View: the entire vertical route of “The Nose” on El Capitan. One of the few people that could do this efficiently and quickly, Alex took the camera and pretty much ran 3,000 feet up with photographer partner Brett Lowell.

Lynn, Alex and I also helped create <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/treks/yosemite/"">a new Yosemite Treks page</a>, where you can take a tour up El Cap and learn more about climbing, from what a “hand jam” is to why we wear such tiny shoes. And as a father, I’m excited kids will learn more about Yosemite when Google brings students to the park through NatureBridge later this year as a part of this project. Plus, its pretty awesome that students who can’t make it to Yosemite yet will be able to go on a virtual reality field trip to the Park with <a href=""http://g.co/expeditions"">Google Expeditions</a>.<br />

Yosemite’s driven so much of my life that I’m excited to be able to share it with the world through my eyes.

1844437769795855732,,Google Blogs,2015-06-23T08:00:00-07:00,Building even better communities with the Google Impact Challenge: Bay Area,"What if low-income kids had the same opportunity for jobs in the tech sector as students from the best computer science departments? What could that mean for their futures, or the future of their communities?<br />
<br />
That’s the question asked by Oakland-based Hack the Hood, whose mission is to inspire Bay Area kids to pursue careers in technology. Hack the Hood trains young people by hiring them to build websites for small businesses in their communities. After applying for the Google Impact Challenge last spring, Hack the Hood went to work with $500,000 in Google.org funding and nearly 100 Googler volunteers. In the past year they’ve expanded their programs in SF, Oakland and Richmond to reach six times as many young people.<br />
<br />
Last year we awarded $5 million to help “hometown hero” organizations like Hack the Hood make a greater impact. Today we’re announcing the <a href=""https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/bayarea2015"">2015 Challenge</a>, and issuing an open call for nonprofits who are asking big “what ifs” about how they can improve their communities and put innovative solutions to work in the Bay Area.<br />

The Bay Area region has always been defined by the people who live here: people who question the status quo to help move our communities forward. From Harvey Milk’s fight for LGBT rights to Alice Waters’ movement for sustainable food to the technological advances of Silicon Valley, the Bay Area has long been at the forefront of positive social change.<br />
<br />
We saw this passion in the 1,000+ nonprofit proposals we received for the 2014 Impact Challenge, and we see it in the 25 finalists. We see it in <a href=""http://ceoworks.org/"">C.E.O.</a>, which is training formerly incarcerated people to reenter the workforce; in <a href=""http://www.lavamae.org/"">Lava Mae</a>’s commitment to bringing showers with dignity to the homeless; and in <a href=""http://missionassetfund.org/"">Mission Asset Fund</a>’s providing low-income people with zero-interest loans. We see it in our neighbors who are striving for a better Bay Area for all.<br />
<br />
As this is our home, and thousands of Googlers live and work here, we want to work together towards an even better Bay Area. The Google Impact Challenge will be accepting proposals from nonprofits through Thursday July 23, 2015 at 11:59 p.m. PDT. To learn more or to nominate a nonprofit visit <a href=""http://g.co/bayareachallenge"">g.co/bayareachallenge</a>.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Update October 21: &nbsp;</i></b>826 Valencia, Bayview/Hunters Point Community Legal, City Year, The Hidden Genius Project, Kiva and the Reset Foundation received the top votes in the 2015 Impact Challenge: Bay Area. You can learn more about these organizations on our <a href=""https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/bayarea2015"">website</a>. <br />
<br />
Amazingly, after more than 400,000 votes—an increase of more than 2X from last year—we had a virtual tie for fourth place. So six organizations, instead of four, will each receive $500,000. Overall that means the total amount funded has increased to $5.5 million.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to all of the nonprofits that participated in the Challenge and work every day to make the Bay Area better for everyone. And thanks to everyone who voted!<br />

3602878156355847062,,Google Blogs,2015-06-22T06:00:00-07:00,Introducing the News Lab ,"It’s hard to think of a more important source of information in the world than quality journalism. At its best, news communicates truth to power, keeps societies free and open, and leads to more informed decision-making by people and leaders. In the past decade, better technology and an open Internet have led to a revolution in how news is created, distributed, and consumed. And given Google’s <a href=""http://www.google.com/about/company/"">mission</a> to ensure quality information is accessible and useful everywhere, we want to help ensure that innovation in news leads to a more informed, more democratic world.<br />
<br />
That’s why we’ve created the <a href=""https://newslab.withgoogle.com/"">News Lab</a>, a new effort at Google to empower innovation at the intersection of technology and media. Our mission is to collaborate with journalists and entrepreneurs to help build the future of media. And we’re tackling this in three ways: though ensuring our tools are made available to journalists around the world (and that newsrooms know how to use them); by getting helpful Google data sets in the hands of journalists everywhere; and through programs designed to build on some of the biggest opportunities that exist in the media industry today.<br />
<div style=""text-align: center;""><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/WcjU3b4rDNk"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
</div><b>Tools for better reporting </b><br />
From Maps to YouTube to Fusion Tables to Earth to Search, we offer many tools that newsrooms can use in their reporting and storytelling. Now, journalists around the world can access tutorials on these products created specifically for newsrooms, at <a href=""http://g.co/newslab"">g.co/newslab</a>. We’ll post short written and video tutorials and case studies that highlight best practices from top newsrooms around the world. As Google develops new products that help journalists, we’ll update these resources regularly. You can also get updates by following us on <a href=""https://twitter.com/googlenewslab"">Twitter</a> and <a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/1/+GoogleNewsLab/posts"">Google+</a>, and by subscribing to our <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/newslabatgoogle"">YouTube</a> channel.<br />

There’s a revolution in data journalism happening in newsrooms today, as more data sets and more tools for analysis are allowing journalists to create insights that were never before possible. To help journalists use our data to offer a unique window to the world, last week we <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/06/a-new-window-into-our-world-with-real.html"">announced</a> an update to our Google Trends platform. The new <a href=""http://google.com/trends"">Google Trends</a> provides journalists with deeper, broader, and real-time data, and incorporates feedback we collected from newsrooms and data journalists around the world. We’re also helping newsrooms around the world tell stories using data, with a <a href=""https://twitter.com/googletrends"">daily feed</a> of curated Google Trends based on the headlines of the day, and through <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/06/17/google-just-created-a-stunning-visualization-of-how-the-world-searches-for-global-warming/"">partnerships</a> <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/tomphillips/google-election-maps#.xmxG9EjZq"">with</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4fu9XZqGu0"">newsrooms</a> on specific data experiments. <br />
<br />
<b>Programs focused on the future of media</b><br />
We’re also working with partners to build a series of programs focused on imagining the future of news and information, as well as on empowering new voices in media. One of the opportunities we’re focused on is increasing the number of media startups in the marketplace. We’ve launched partnerships with <a href=""http://matter.vc/"">Matter</a>, a media accelerator in San Francisco, and <a href=""http://hackshackers.com/"">Hacks/Hackers</a>, a global community group for developers and journalists, to provide financial support and mentorship from Google engineers that will help these organizations expand their impact to more startups around the world. We’re also holding a series of <a href=""https://www.revealnews.org/events-page/techraking/"">TechRaking</a> summits with the Center for Investigative Reporting: hackathons focused on developing new investigative tools such as <a href=""http://knight.stanford.edu/news-notes/2015/elevating-the-news-with-drones/"">drones</a>, online databases, and more.<br />
<br />
Another area we’ve focused our programs on is citizen reporting. Now that mobile technology allows anyone to be a reporter, we want to do our part to ensure that user-generated news content is a positive and game-changing force in media. We’re doing that with <a href=""http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2015/06/eyewitness-video-on-youtube-your-window.html"">three projects</a>—<a href=""https://medium.com/@FirstDraft"">First Draft</a>, the <a href=""http://lab.witness.org/"">WITNESS Media Lab</a>, and the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOaMIPk5GtosYNi32liVbRg"">YouTube Newswire</a>—each of which aims to make YouTube and other open platforms more useful places for first-hand news content from citizen reporters around the world.<br />
<br />
The News Lab is a global effort, with teams in the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany to start—and we’re also powering the training and research arm of Google’s <a href=""http://www.digitalnewsinitiative.com/"">Digital News Initiative</a> in Europe. <br />
<br />
Google has created many technologies and platforms that have engaged the media industry. As both the media landscape and technology continue to evolve, we believe we can create a more informed world if technologists and journalists work together—and we’re excited to be part of the effort.<br />

Here’s a look at what people were searching for after the tragedy, plus a glimpse into what else was on searchers’ minds this week.<br />
<br />
<b>Tragedy in the south</b><br />
On Wednesday night, a gunman shot and killed nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, a historic black church in Charleston, S.C. The suspect, Dylann Roof, was arrested Thursday morning, and charged today with nine counts of murder. As people tried to make sense of the story, many turned to the web, leading searches for “<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Charleston+Shooting&amp;std=20150617&amp;pn=p1#a=20150617-Charleston+Shooting"">Charleston shooting</a>” to climb to more than 5 million. Top questions in the early morning after the shooting include “What was the motive of the hate crime shooting in Charleston?” Many were also interested in the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Confederate+flag&amp;std=20150618&amp;pn=p1#a=20150618-Confederate+flag"">Confederate flag</a>, which still flies above the S.C. Capitol building; interest in the flag spiked 20X in the past week in the U.S. as people asked questions like “What does the Confederate flag stand for?”<br />
<br />
<b>Presidential politics</b><br />
We’re still well more than a year away from the 2016 election but the presidential race is already crowded, and getting more so. This week two new candidates joined the fray: <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Jeb+Bush&amp;std=20150614&amp;pn=p1#a=20150614-Jeb+Bush"">Jeb Bush</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Donald+Trump&amp;std=20150616&amp;pn=p1#a=20150616-Donald+Trump"">Donald Trump</a> both announced they plan to run, bringing the total number of Republican candidates to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/2016-presidential-candidates.html"">a cool dozen</a>. Though Bush was the most searched candidate in more than 25 states after his announcement, it didn’t last long. Following Trump’s announcement Tuesday, he became the most searched Republican Presidential candidate in every state in the U.S. Top questions on the newest candidates include “Is Jeb Bush related to George Bush?” (that would be a “yes”) and “What is Donald Trump’s net worth?” (he says more than $8 billion; the numbers are <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/06/17/415003043/the-problem-with-donald-trumps-one-page-summary-on-his-wealth"">disputed</a>).<br />

This week was big for sports, with Google’s own hometown team <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Golden+State+Warriors&amp;std=20150616&amp;pn=p1#a=20150616-Golden+State+Warriors"">Golden State Warriors</a> beating the Cleveland Cavaliers to win their first NBA Championship title since 1975. The Warriors were at the top of the search charts on Tuesday with more than 2 million searches. Meanwhile, in hockey, the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Chicago+Blackhawks&amp;std=20150615&amp;pn=p1#a=20150615-Chicago+Blackhawks"">Chicago Blackhawks</a> edged out the Tampa Bay Lightning to win the Stanley Cup for the second time in three seasons. Winning never gets old, though: interest in Blackhawks apparel spiked 8X in Chicago between June 9-16, and there were more than 20,000+ searches for the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Blackhawks+Parade+Route&amp;std=20150618&amp;pn=p1#a=20150618-Blackhawks+Parade+Route"">Blackhawks parade route</a>, which took place Thursday with more than 2 million attendees. <br />
<br />
Hockey and basketball not your game? Then perhaps you were one of the 8 million people watching the fifth-season finale of HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Spoilers for the show follow.) The show was the subject of <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Game+of+Thrones&amp;std=20150614&amp;pn=p1#a=20150614-Game+of+Thrones"">2 million searches</a> on Sunday night, as people watched with baited breath to find out what gruesome ends the show had in store for their favorite characters <i>this</i> season. One of the top questions about the show was simply “Who died on ‘Game of Thrones’?”, while others expressed their disbelief by asking “Is Jon Snow dead?” and “Is Stannis dead?” There were also more than 200K searches for <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Lena+Headey&amp;std=20150614&amp;pn=p1#a=20150614-Lena+Headey"">Lena Headley</a>, who plays Cersei Lannister, and another 20K later in the week for <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Rebecca+Van+Cleave&amp;std=20150618&amp;pn=p1#a=20150618-Rebecca+Van+Cleave"">Rebecca Van Cleave</a>, Headley’s body double for a scene where Cersei is forced to walk naked through the streets. Finally, there was a lot of interest in <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Arya+Stark&amp;std=20150614&amp;pn=p1#a=20150614-Arya+Stark"">Arya Stark</a>, one of few surviving Stark children, whose path on the show has also been one of the strangest.<br />
<br />
<b>Tip of the week</b><br />
This weekend marks the first official day of summer, and that means BBQ season. If you’re watching what you eat, Google can help you figure out what to choose at the picnic table. Just ask Google to “compare coleslaw and potato salad” or “compare burgers and pulled pork.” <br />

<br />
Growing up, the best part about Ramadan was eating way too much lentil soup with my family and catching up on the latest episode of our favorite series, ""Bab Al-Hara."" Today, living more than 1900 miles away from my family, I rely on technology to get close with them during Ramadan. Whether it’s sharing moments on Hangouts, my sister sending me pictures of the iftar spread of the day, or receiving an avalanche of recipes from my mother for me to save and try out, technology helps us stay connected and celebrate Ramadan together even when away. <br />
<br />
In fact, technology helps more than 200 million Muslims living away from their families connect and share moments with loved ones. People look to Maps to navigate traffic and make it home from work for Iftar, download Google Play apps to plan their day around the sunset and sunrise, and look up Ramadan opening hours of their favorite local shops and restaurants.<br />

<b><br />
</b> <b>Jailbreak</b><br />
Two prisoners made headlines this week after escaping from the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Clinton+Correctional+Facility&amp;std=20150607&amp;pn=p1#a=20150607-Clinton+Correctional+Facility"">Clinton Correctional Facility</a> in upstate New York. People are coming to Google to learn how the two broke out of the prison and about the status of the manhunt, which is still ongoing. In addition to more than 100K searches each for [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=prison+escape&amp;std=20150608&amp;pn=p1#a=20150608-prison+escape"">prison escape</a>] and the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Clinton+Correctional+Facility&amp;std=20150607&amp;pn=p1#a=20150607-Clinton+Correctional+Facility"">facility itself</a>, people are asking questions like “How often do prisoners escape?” and “How many prison escapes are there per year?” The incident has also sparked interest in other prison escape tales; search interest in “The Shawshank Redemption” spiked 8X in the past week.  And in happier, more fictional prison news, Netflix dropped the third season of “<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Orange+Is+the+New+Black&amp;std=20150611&amp;pn=p1#a=20150611-Orange+Is+the+New+Black"">Orange is the New Black</a>” six hours early yesterday, leading to a jump of 500,000K searches for the hit show.<br />
<br />
<b>High stakes</b><br />
Next, the NBA Finals are heating up as the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors are now tied at two games apiece, and searchers can’t get enough. There were more than 2 million searches for the Finals on <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=NBA+Finals&amp;std=20150607&amp;pn=p1#a=20150607-NBA+Finals"">Saturday</a>, when the Cavs beat the Warriors in Game 2, and another 5 million <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=NBA+Finals&amp;std=20150609&amp;pn=p1#a=20150609-NBA+Finals"">when the Warriors went down 2-1</a> in Game 3 as people looked for scores, news, and players. There were more than 500K searches on Thursday for <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=LeBron+James&amp;std=20150611&amp;pn=p1#a=20150611-LeBron+James"">LeBron James</a>, who got stitches after colliding with a cameraman during the game. Meanwhile, league MVP and Warriors point guard Steph Curry has been a hot topic on Search throughout the playoffs, but as his performance in the Finals <a href=""http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/06/steph-curry-mvp-worst-nba-finals-golden-state-warriors-lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers"">faltered</a> in the first few games, search interest in several of his teammates has risen. People have been looking for info about Curry’s fellow “Splash Brother” <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Klay+Thompson&amp;std=20150610&amp;pn=p1#a=20150610-Klay+Thompson"">Klay Thompson</a> and about <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Andre+Iguodala&amp;std=20150612&amp;pn=p1#a=20150612-Andre+Iguodala"">Andre Iguodala</a>, who started his first game of the season on Thursday and may have <a href=""http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/06/andre-iguodala-perfectly-trolled-lebron-james-during-game-4-blowout"">poked some fun</a> at LeBron James in the process.<br />
<br />
Off the court and onto the pitch, it’s also a great time to be a soccer fan, between the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Champions+League&amp;std=20150605&amp;pn=p1#a=20150605-Champions+League"">Champions League final</a>, the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Copa+America+2015&amp;std=20150611&amp;pn=p1#a=20150611-Copa+America+2015"">Copa America</a>, and the Women’s World Cup. The latter drew more than 5 million searches on <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Women+S+World+Cup&amp;std=20150607&amp;pn=p1#a=20150607-Women+S+World+Cup"">Saturday</a> alone, and as the U.S. faced off against Australia Monday, interest was high in players like Alex Morgan, Hope Solo and Sydney Leroux. Finally, we’d be remiss to write about sports this week without mentioning the first Triple Crown winner since 1978, American Pharoah, who won the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Belmont+Stakes&amp;std=20150605&amp;pn=p1#a=20150605-Belmont+Stakes"">Belmont Stakes</a> last weekend and ran home with a million searches in the bargain.<br />

</b> <b>Change is in the air</b><br />
<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Beyonce&amp;std=20150608&amp;pn=p1#a=20150608-Beyonce"">Beyonce</a> was trending this week after revealing that she has adopted a vegan diet on Good Morning America. Many of Queen Bey’s fans were disappointed that her announcement was about her eating habits, and not the release of a new album or baby #2.  Giving up cheese would be hard enough. But this week pop culture fans confronted the potential loss of something else dear: the long-running (fictional) marriage between Homer and Marge Simpson. With the 27th season of “The Simpsons” on deck in the fall, the show’s executive producer had hinted that TV’s longest-running couple might separate. Amidst the outrage and worry, searchers turned to the web to ask “Why are the Simpsons getting divorced?” Luckily, it seems the rumors are just that—the show cleared the air <a href=""https://twitter.com/thesimpsons/status/608783628810584064"">on Twitter and in chalk</a>.<br />

8709953060978410691,,Google Blogs,2015-06-12T12:00:00-07:00,A YouTube built for gamers,"As a kid, I spent hours on the living room couch playing video games with friends, taking turns trying to beat Ganon in ""Ocarina of Time"" and trading Pokémon until I had all 151. Soon controller passing and Game Boy link cables gave way to network multiplayer and PC LAN parties. Eventually, my living room became a virtual one, with a network of gamers sharing experiences and discoveries.&nbsp;

<br />
<br />
Today, the gaming world is much more diverse than the one I grew up with, and the community has created new formats that have made gaming more collaborative and interactive. On YouTube, gaming has spawned entirely new genres of videos, from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ9bpcdMd_U"">let’s plays</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_aj5ROfakM"">walkthroughs</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq6pGJbd6Iw"">speedruns</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNUcDkNI24o"">cooking</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY6SlRK5SIo"">music videos</a>. Now, it’s our turn to return the favor with something built just for gamers. 
<br />
<br />
This summer, we'll launch  <a href=""http://gaming.youtube.com/"">YouTube Gaming</a>, a brand new app and website to keep you connected to the games, players, and culture that matter to you, with videos, live streams, and the biggest community of gamers on the web—all in one place.<br />

YouTube Gaming is built to be all about your favorite games and gamers, with more videos than anywhere else. From ""Asteroids"" to ""Zelda,"" more than 25,000 games will each have their own page, a single place for all the best videos and live streams about that title. You’ll also find channels from a wide array of game publishers and YouTube creators.<br />
<br />
Keeping up with these games and channels is now super easy, too. Add a game to your collection for quick access whenever you want to check up on the latest videos. Subscribe to a channel, and you'll get a notification as soon as they start a live stream. Uncover new favorites with recommendations based on the games and channels you love. And when you want something specific, you can search with confidence, knowing that typing “call” will show you “Call of Duty” and not “Call Me Maybe.”&nbsp;

Live streams bring the gaming community closer together, so we’ve put them front-and-center on the YouTube Gaming homepage. And in the coming weeks, we’ll launch an improved live experience that makes it simpler to broadcast your gameplay to YouTube. On top of existing features like <a href=""http://youtubecreator.blogspot.com/2015/05/60fps-live-streaming-on-youtube-in-html5.html"">high frame rate streaming at 60fps</a>, DVR, and automatically converting your stream into a YouTube video, we’re redesigning our system so that you no longer need to schedule a live event ahead of time. We’re also creating single link you can share for all your streams.<br />
<br />
YouTube Gaming will be available this summer, starting in the U.S. and U.K. We’re building this just for gamers—so we want to hear from you about how we can make it the best way to connect with your community. If you’re at <a href=""http://www.e3expo.com/"">E3</a> next week, come by our booth for an early look at everything we’ve been working on. If not, tune in live from home at <a href=""http://youtube.com/e3"">youtube.com/e3</a>, head over to <a href=""http://gaming.youtube.com/"">gaming.youtube.com</a> and follow us <a href=""https://twitter.com/youtubegaming"">@YouTubeGaming</a> and you’ll be the first to know when YouTube Gaming is ready for you to play with.<br />

<br />
<b>“Call me Caitlyn”</b><br />
Caitlyn Jenner topped the trends this week, with <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Caitlyn+Jenner&amp;std=20150531&amp;pn=p1#a=20150531-Caitlyn+Jenner"">more than 10 million searches</a> since she introduced herself to the world on Monday with a “Vanity Fair” cover story. Her high-profile transition has put Jenner at the center of an active national dialogue about transgender equality and rights. The news dominated headlines and news feeds for several days—in fact, searches for Jenner were nearly seven times higher than than searches for Kim Kardashian, who announced her second pregnancy with husband Kanye West over the weekend.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hBtVEoQh-dQ/VXItyCaOWRI/AAAAAAAAQbk/Kff-PG1UaBQ/s1600/CaitlynJennerVsKimKardashian.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""320"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hBtVEoQh-dQ/VXItyCaOWRI/AAAAAAAAQbk/Kff-PG1UaBQ/s640/CaitlynJennerVsKimKardashian.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><br />
<b>Remembering Beau Biden</b><br />
Another well-known family shared the search spotlight this week, although for very different reasons. Beau Biden, Delaware attorney general and son of Vice President Joe Biden, died of brain cancer on May 30. Searches for news about his life and death <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Beau+Biden&amp;std=20150604&amp;pn=p1#a=20150604-Beau+Biden"">topped 100,000</a> ahead of memorial services held in his honor on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.<br />
<br />
<b>All the sports</b><br />
With the NBA and Stanley Cup finals underway, and the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Women+S+World+Cup+2015&amp;std=20150605&amp;pn=p1#a=20150605-Women+S+World+Cup+2015"">Women’s World Cup</a> set to kick off over the weekend, it was a particularly sports-heavy week on search. People wanted to know where and when to tune in for the NBA games, and while “How many times has Lebron James been to the finals” was one of the top questions, <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/606509168502165504"">searches for Warriors</a> star Steph Curry were higher than searches for James in nearly every state.<br />

On the hockey front, the Chicago Blackhawks, who currently lead the series 1-0, are also <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/606160973276323840"">dominating the search trends</a> over the Tampa Bay Lightning.

<br />
<b>Summertime sadness</b><br />
It may not be June 21 yet, but school is out, temperatures are up and Memorial Day weekend is practically a distant memory. Summer is here, and for everyone looking to get out of town, Southwest Airlines had just the thing: a 72-hour sale. With plane tickets at less than $100, turns out too many people wanted to get out of town—traffic from would-be travelers crashed Southwest’s website for two days, while searches <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Southwest+Airlines&amp;std=20150603&amp;pn=p1#a=20150603-Southwest+Airlines"">about the sale and the site</a> topped 500,000. <br />
<br />
<b>Tip of the Week</b><br />
No time to watch the game this weekend? Find out what you missed—just ask the Google app, “Who won the Warriors game?” to get box scores, video highlights and more.<br />

Last year, we watched in awe of the <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/07/from-superheroes-to-battle-of.html"">2.1 billion search queries</a> related to the World Cup. And regardless of whether it’s a tournament year, football (or soccer if you please) crushes the competition as the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F02vx4%2C%20%2Fm%2F018w8%2C%20%2Fm%2F09xp_%2C%20%2Fm%2F07bs0%2C%20%2Fm%2F0jm_&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">most-searched</a> sport worldwide.<br />

That’s not for a lack of amazing performance on the field by women athletes—rather, it's because women’s sports have historically been paid less attention than men’s. For instance, women’s football was <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/23147072"">banned</a> by the English FA (and other European organizations) until the 1970s, and it didn’t become <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=1.+What+year+was+womens+soccer+added+to+the+olympics%3F&amp;oq=1.+What+year+was+womens+soccer+added+to+the+olympics%3F&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.231j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8"">an Olympic sport</a> until 1996.<br />

<i>You just lost your phone and want to wipe your personal information.</i><br />
<i>You attend an event, and you want to share your photos with some people (but not everyone).</i><br />
<i>You hesitate as you download another app that's asking for a lot of information.</i><br />
<br />
Everyday, we make choices that affect our privacy and security online. Most people, however, don’t feel they have the right level of control to make these important decisions. According to a <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/05/20/americans-attitudes-about-privacy-security-and-surveillance/"">recent Pew study</a>, 93 percent of people think it’s important to control access to their personal information, and 90 percent care about the type of information that’s collected about them. But only 9 percent feel they have “a lot” of control over it. We want to change that.<br />
<br />
Google builds simple, powerful privacy and security tools that keep your information safe and put you in control of it. At Google I/O, we <a href=""http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2015/05/android-m-developer-preview-tools.html"">announced</a> that people will have more control over the information they provide to mobile apps in the M release, the next version of Android. Today, we’re rolling out two significant improvements to our privacy and security tools: a new hub for managing your Google settings called My Account, and a new site that answers important questions about privacy and security on Google.<br />
<br />
<b>Privacy and security controls, all in one place</b><br />
Privacy and security are two sides of the same coin: if your information isn’t secure, it certainly can’t be private. <a href=""http://myaccount.google.com/"">My Account</a>&nbsp;gives you quick access to the settings and tools that help you safeguard your data, protect your privacy, and decide what information is used to make Google services work better for you. It also provides more context to help you understand your options and make the right choices for you.<br />

<li>Manage the information that can be used from Search, Maps, YouTube and other products to enhance your experience on Google. For example, you can turn on and off settings such as Web and App Activity, which gets you more relevant, faster search results, or Location History, which enables Google Maps and Now to give you tips for a faster commute back home.</li>
<li>Use the Ads Settings tool to control ads based on your interests and the searches you’ve done.</li>
<li>Control which apps and sites are connected to your account.</li>
</ul>We built My Account to be a resource for everyone, even if you don't have a Google Account. Check out your controls at <a href=""http://myaccount.google.com/"">myaccount.google.com</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Answering your questions about privacy and security </b><br />
We listen to feedback from people around the world to better understand their concerns about privacy and security. In addition to My Account, we want to help people find answers to common questions on these topics, such as: ""What data does Google collect? What does Google do with the data it collects? What tools do I have to control my Google experience?"" <br />
<br />
Our new site, <a href=""http://privacy.google.com/"">privacy.google.com</a>, candidly answers these questions, and more. We also explain how we show relevant ads without selling your personal information, how encryption and spam filtering help keep your data safe, and how your information helps customize your experience on Google.

<br />
<b>Deadly storms in Texas</b><br />
Widespread flooding caused by heavy rains in Texas and Oklahoma has left many dead, missing or unaccounted for, along with seriously damaged property and abandoned vehicles. With more severe weather predicted this weekend, <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/603256428367912960"">cities across Texas</a> topped the places searching for “storms,” with “How long does it take for streets to clear a flood?” and “where is it flooded in Houston” among the top storm-related questions.<br />

Football’s governing body was in the search spotlight this week after the arrest of several FIFA officials in a dawn raid at a hotel in Zurich, Switzerland.  There were more than half a million “FIFA” searches <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=FIFA&amp;std=20150526&amp;pn=p1#a=20150526-FIFA"">on Tuesday alone</a>, with a <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/603692214175281152"">top related question</a> being the basic “What is FIFA?” (perhaps for those that call it “soccer”). Just as fans of “The Beautiful Game” span the globe, so do searches related to this week’s alleged ugliness. Costa Rica and Uruguay—home to two of the indicted officials—are among the top 10 countries searching for #FIFAarrests. <br />

<b>Hold on to your butts ... again</b><br />
It’s a Jurassic World. We just live in it. Twenty-two years after the original “Jurassic Park” movie, the release of “Jurassic World” is set to wow audiences worldwide, and ticket pre-sales and general dino-excitement have caused a 100,000+ search spike, while the trailer has topped <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFinNxS5KN4"">60 million YouTube views</a>. Search-wise, the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=jurassic%20world&amp;date=today%207-d&amp;cmpt=date&amp;tz="">U.S. and Australia</a> are most excited about the blockbuster, which will pit star Chris Pratt against a 50-foot-tall dinosaur named Indominus Rex. We’ll have to wait until June for the showdown, but based on <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Indominus%20rex%2C%20chris%20pratt&amp;date=today%203-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">current search interest</a>, our money's on Pratt. <br />
<br />
<b>Tip of the week</b><br />
This weekend is Manhattanhenge, the moment when the setting sun aligns precisely with Manhattan’s street grid. Whether you’re in New York or not, you can find out when the sun will dip below the horizon with a simple “Ok Google, when does the sun set?” You’ll get an answer tailored for your location.<br />

Captured at California's San Diego Zoo, the clip is a 19-second description of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbpi6ZahtOH57RvwW6bbGFRr2qQ5kMcKP"">what exactly makes elephants so cool</a>. Its brief runtime and casual setup suggest little of the online video craziness that would follow over the subsequent decade. <br />
<br />
But it turns out “Me at the Zoo” proved to be a simple distillation of the premise of the new platform, where anyone could just turn on a camera and broadcast themselves with ease.

2793130049893720747,,Google Blogs,2015-05-28T11:48:00-07:00,You say you want a mobile revolution...,"This morning, more than 6,000 developers descended on San Francisco’s Moscone Center to burn through 1,500 gallons of coffee and join millions of others via live stream for our 8th annual Google I/O—a time to fill people in on what we’ve been building recently, and how we’re tackling the future. <br />
<br />
<b>Android growth and momentum</b><br />
In just a short number of years, mobile technology has completely changed the way we find information and entertainment, communicate with friends and family, and get things done. Having a supercomputer in our pocket is now second nature; today more searches on Google come from mobile than from desktop computers, and by <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/there-are-officially-more-mobile-devices-than-people-in-the-world-9780518.html"">some estimates</a> there are more mobile devices than there are people on the planet. For evidence of the mobile revolution, look no further than the growth of Android. There are now more than one billion Android users worldwide—a long way from when we launched the first Android phone back in 2008. And there are 4,000 unique Android devices on the market, from more than 400 manufacturers and over 500 carriers.<br />
<br />
The devices themselves have changed a lot, too. In today’s multi-screen world, you can now use Android on your phone, your tablet, your wrist, in your car and in your living room, and move seamlessly between each. Many of these new form factors have arrived just in the last year. You can now choose from seven different Android Wear watches, not to mention bands, styles, and more than 1,500 watch faces built by developers.<br />
<br />
By the end of this year, 35 car models will offer Android Auto, helping you access Search, Maps, music and other information through your car’s controls. And the first sets running Android TV have now arrived. <br />
<br />
With all of these new places and devices for people to use Android, developers have even more opportunities to build the apps that people use for education and engagement and entertainment. So today we talked about the new tools and features we’re giving them to build more powerful experiences on the Android platform.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q3Q3Y93BMe4/VWc8kiyHdDI/AAAAAAAAQXE/C8EcsBp5m6c/s1600/device-lineup-2015.001.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q3Q3Y93BMe4/VWc8kiyHdDI/AAAAAAAAQXE/C8EcsBp5m6c/s600/device-lineup-2015.001.png"" width=""600"" /></a></div><b>M is for more performance and an improved user experience</b><br />
Android M is the most powerful Android release yet, with <a href=""http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2015/05/android-m-developer-preview-tools.html"">hundreds</a> of improvements made to the platform. Among the highlights, we’ve improved battery life and streamlined permissions for apps to make it easier for you to decide what information the apps on your phone can use. We previewed <a href=""http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2015/05/pay-your-way-with-android.html"">Android Pay</a>, which lets you pay for things with your phone, without even opening an app. And we’re making it much easier to find information in apps, as well as making some important updates to Google Now (more on that below!).<br />
<br />
<b>Organizing the world’s information, better</b><br />
Your mobile phone packs a lot of information, but it’s not always easy to find that nugget of information when you need it—as you know if you’ve ever tried to navigate your email, organize hundreds of photos across devices, or search for restaurant reviews when you’re chatting about dinner plans with friends. Luckily, finding and organizing information is something Google is good at (some might even call it our <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=google%20mission"">mission</a>). <br />
<br />
So as part of M release, we’re <a href=""http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2015/05/now-on-tap.html"">expanding Google Now</a>&nbsp;to give people on-demand assistance in the moment they need it—like seeing if there’s an open table at a new restaurant or when and where “Pitch Perfect 2” is playing—no matter where you are on your phone. We’re also making it much easier to <a href=""http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2014/06/more-apps-in-google-searchnow-even.html"">find new apps and in-app content</a>—which is good news for both users and developers.<br />
<br />
We’ve also put our years of research into machine learning to work in other ways, making Search more useful and your <a href=""http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/thanks-to-you-inbox-by-gmail-is-now.html"">inbox more insightful</a>. And now it’s also helping you make sense of all your photos. Today we launched a <a href=""//googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/picture-this-fresh-approach-to-photos.html"">new Photos app</a>&nbsp;that gives you a single place for all your photos and videos, and helps you sort through them more quickly, bring them to life in cool new ways, and share them however you choose.<br />
<br />
<b>A new platform for the Internet of Things</b><br />
We’re surrounded by devices, but they often exist independently of each other. Our day-to-day lives will be much simpler when these technologies can talk to each other—if our recipe app, for example, could communicate with our smart oven to turn the temperature to exactly the right setting. ​Or outside the home—from transportation systems that notify commuters of schedule changes, to farms where harvesters and irrigation systems are controlled from phones. ​<br />
<br />
But many roadblocks remain—the user experience is inconsistent and confusing, manufacturers often redo their work for every device, devices don’t interoperate, and developers often have no way to create great experiences across devices.<br />
<br />
Enter <a href=""https://developers.google.com/brillo"">Project Brillo</a>, a new platform derived from Android that lets developers and manufacturers build connected devices. As part of Brillo, we’re introducing a communications protocol (Weave) developed in partnership with Nest, a set of developer APIs, a core set of schemas and a certification program to ensure device and app interoperability.<br />
<br />
Although it will launch later this year, we previewed Brillo today because we’re committed to fostering a vibrant ecosystem in which we all work together to move the industry forward.<br />
<br />
<b>New mobile experiences</b><br />
Mobile has evolved so much in the past few years, with connected screens for different experiences depending on your needs. But we are just at the start of what will prove to be a much more immersive mobile experience. At last year’s I/O we introduced <a href=""https://g.co/cardboard"">Cardboard</a>, which lets you turn your phone into a virtual reality experience. Now there are more than 500 <a href=""https://g.co/cardboardapps"">Cardboard apps</a> for film, games, tours and learning, and more than 1 million Cardboard viewers have been shipped. Today we announced iOS support for developers and debuted <a href=""https://g.co/expeditions"">Google Expeditions</a>, which lets students take virtual trips with Cardboard to places like the moon and underwater. We also shared a preview of <a href=""https://g.co/jump"">Jump</a>, which lets you capture the world in video that you can step inside of. <br />
<br />
<b>The next billion users</b><br />
The first billion users of the Internet came online through desktops. The next billion are taking a different path to computing—coming online through mobile and smartphones—and present a unique set of opportunities and challenges. We’re working hard on ensure these people have a great experience across our products. <br />
<br />
In addition to making devices more affordable with <a href=""https://www.google.com/chromebook/"">Chromebooks</a> and <a href=""https://www.android.com/intl/en_us/one/"">Android One</a> (now in seven countries), we’re making changes to ensure that our software works even where there aren’t great Internet connections. We’ve launched a <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+google/posts/XZo6qgrNDE9"">streamlined version of our Search results page</a> in 13 countries, and 73 million people now use <a href=""https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2392284?hl=en"">data saver mode</a> in Chrome to browse the web more efficiently. Finally, we previewed the new offline maps—that’s right, and it’s as simple as it sounds—maps that you can take offline, even with turn-by-turn directions.<br />
<br />
<b>Solving complex problems for a mobile world</b><br />
From our earliest days in Search, our aim has always been to build products for everyone, applying unique technical insight to tackle big problems. That’s just as relevant in today’s mobile-centric world—from finding the information scattered across apps, to helping someone organize and share the photos of their kids; from taking people on a virtual trip to the Pyramids to helping the next billion people come online.<br />
<br />
And by providing a platform on top of which any developer can innovate, we can reach people around the world and put the power of the Internet in their hands—no matter what device they use, where they live or who they are.<br />
<br />
So here’s to the mobile revolution. We can’t wait to see what comes next.<br />

685244243870111082,,Google Blogs,2015-05-28T10:45:00-07:00,Picture this: A fresh approach to Photos,"Every second of every day, people around the world are capturing their memories through photos and videos. Humankind has already taken trillions of photos and will take another <a href=""http://mylio.com/one-trillion-photos-in-2015/"">trillion</a> this year alone.<br />
<br />
But the more moments we capture, the more challenging it becomes to relive those memories. Photos and videos become littered across mobile devices, old computers, hard drives and online services (which are constantly running out of space). It’s almost impossible to find that one photo right at the moment you need it, and sharing a bunch of photos at once is frustrating, often requiring special apps and logins. <br />
<br />
We wanted to do better. So today we’re introducing Google Photos—a new, standalone product that gives you a home for all your photos and videos, helps you organize and bring your moments to life, and lets you share and save what matters.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bpj2B0dA6O8/VWc3o7gHpWI/AAAAAAAAQVo/4hjit3Bgc8E/s1600/all-three-v4.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""380"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bpj2B0dA6O8/VWc3o7gHpWI/AAAAAAAAQVo/4hjit3Bgc8E/s640/all-three-v4.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><b>A home for all your photos and videos</b><br />
Google Photos gives you a single, private place to keep a lifetime of memories, and access them from any device. They’re automatically backed up and synced, so you can have peace of mind that your photos are safe, available across all your devices.  <br />
<br />
And when we say a lifetime of memories, we really mean it. With Google Photos, you can now backup and store unlimited, high-quality photos and videos, for free.

Google Photos automatically organizes your memories by the people, places, and things that matter. You don’t have to tag or label any of them, and you don’t need to laboriously create albums. When you want to find a particular shot, with a simple search you can instantly find any photo—whether it’s your dog, your daughter’s birthday party, or your favorite beach in Santa Barbara. And all of this auto-grouping is private, for your eyes only.<br />

With Google Photos, you have the choice to share your photos and videos however you want across any service you choose, from Hangouts to Twitter to WhatsApp. But even then, it’s still remarkably difficult to share a lot of photos just with friends and family and keep the ones shared with you—it usually involves a lot of downloading and re-uploading across a number of different services. We wanted to make sharing much simpler and more reliable. <br />
<br />
You can now take any set of photos and videos, or any album, and simply create a link to share hundreds of photos at once. The recipient can see what you shared without a special app or login, then immediately save the high-quality images to their own library with a single tap. So now it’s easier to hang on to the photos you care about even if you weren’t the one holding the camera.<br />

With this launch we've made a lot of progress towards eliminating many of the frustrations involved in storing, editing and sharing your memories. But we have a lot more in store—so as you keep snapping photos and capturing videos, we’ll keep working on making them even easier to store, share and bring to life. <br />

8503676129998051281,,Google Blogs,2015-05-26T08:00:00-07:00,Pursuing transformative technology with the Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities,"When Laura Palmaro was 10 years old, she woke one morning to find that the central vision in her left eye had all but disappeared. She was not ill and had no genetic issues—it was completely out of the blue. When she was 14, the same rare condition struck her right eye, and she began her freshman year of high school legally blind. Suddenly she was forced to depend on other people to read everything aloud, from school assignments to menus. The toughest part, according to Laura, was losing her sense of independence—and not knowing when or how she would get it back.<br />
<br />
Laura has since adopted technological solutions to her vision challenges, using a combination of screen-readers and magnification software to read, work and more. Now a program manager at Google, she is following her passion, helping Chrome and Chrome OS teams make their products more accessible. “Technology has truly transformed my life,” she says. “Assistive technology can tear down boundaries, and empower people to find their independence and fulfill their dreams.”<br />
<br />
We agree with Laura about the power of technology to change lives. And in order to support more people like her—people who see obstacles as opportunities—we’re launching the <a href=""http://g.co/ImpactChallengeDisability"">Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities</a>. We’re putting $20 million in Google.org grants behind nonprofits using emerging technologies to increase independence for people living with disabilities, and today we’re issuing an open call to identify new areas of opportunity at <a href=""http://g.co/ImpactChallengeDisability"">g.co/ImpactChallengeDisability</a>.<br />
<br />
We’re kicking things off with support for two remarkable organizations. Each of these organizations is using technology to dramatically reduce the cost of and access to prosthetic limbs and auditory therapy, respectively—which could be transformative for hundreds of millions of people.<br />
<br />
<ul><li>The <a href=""http://enablingthefuture.org/"">Enable community</a> connects people who want prosthetics with volunteers who use 3D printers to design, print, assemble, and fit them, for free.  This dramatically cuts costs,  increases  speed of distribution, and meets unmet needs.  We’ll support the Enable Community Foundation's efforts with a $600,000 grant to advance the design, distribution and delivery of open-source 3D-printed upper-limb prosthetics.</li>
<li>Diagnosing auditory challenges can be a struggle in low income communities—the equipment is expensive, bulky and unrealistic, particularly in the developing world. With our support, and a $500,000 grant, <a href=""http://www.wwhearing.org/"">World Wide Hearing</a> will develop, prototype and test an extremely low cost tool kit for hearing loss using smartphone technology that’s widely available—and affordable—in the developing world.</li>
</ul><br />
The Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities will seek out nonprofits and help them find new solutions to some serious “what ifs” for the disabled community. We will choose the best of these ideas and help them to scale by investing in their vision, by rallying our people and by mobilizing our resources in support of their missions.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4NLr-Dg2FKI/VWP-NP0sAvI/AAAAAAAAQVI/r-nvkUDpiJU/s1600/GIC%2BSocial_one%2Bbillion.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""332"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4NLr-Dg2FKI/VWP-NP0sAvI/AAAAAAAAQVI/r-nvkUDpiJU/s640/GIC%2BSocial_one%2Bbillion.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></div>But of course, we realize there’s always room to improve our products as well. We have a team committed to monitoring the accessibility of Google tools; and we provide engineering teams with training to incorporate accessibility principles into products and services. That doesn’t just mean improving existing Google tools, it means developing new ones as well. For example, Liftware is a stabilizing utensil designed to help people with hand tremors eat more easily, and self-driving cars could one day transform mobility for everyone.<br />
<br />
Historically, people living with disabilities have relied on technologies that were often bulky, expensive, and limited to assisting with one or two specific tasks. But that’s beginning to change. Thanks to groups like Enable and World Wide Hearing, and with tools like Liftware, we’re starting to see the potential for technologies that can profoundly and affordably impact millions. But we’ll all get there sooner if we make it a team effort—which is why we’re launching Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities today. Together, we can create a better world, faster. <br />

7928172358650551387,,Google Blogs,2015-05-25T21:56:00-07:00,A doodle salute for Sally Ride ,"<i>Today’s guest blog post is from Tam O’Shaughnessy—life partner of astronaut Sally Ride, and co-founder &amp; CEO of <a href=""http://sallyridescience.com/"">Sally Ride Science</a>. Over the past few months, Tam worked with our Doodle team to create a <a href=""http://www.google.com/doodles/sally-rides-64th-birthday"">doodle for Sally’s 64th birthday</a>. In this post, she tells us more about Sally’s life, her flight aboard the space shuttle </i>Challenger<i>, and her passion for helping kids stay excited about science and technology. </i>-Ed.<br />
<br />
As the first American woman in space, Sally Ride—who would have been 64 today—captured the nation’s imagination as a symbol of the ability of women to break barriers. But her historic flight represented just one aspect of a remarkable and multifaceted life. She was also a physicist, a science writer, and an inspirational advocate for keeping kids excited about science as they go through school.<br />
<br />
Sally was born on May 26, 1951, in Los Angeles. She grew up playing with a chemistry set and small telescope—and playing football in the streets with the neighborhood kids. Later she considered playing professional tennis, but decided instead to study science. <br />
<br />
In 1977, Sally was finishing her Ph.D. in physics at Stanford University when she saw an article in the student newspaper saying that NASA was looking for astronauts—and for the first time was allowing women to apply. Sally didn’t hesitate to send in her application, and became one of six women selected as part of the new crop of astronaut candidates. On June 18, 1983, she soared into history as the first American woman in space.<br />
<div style=""text-align: center;"">

<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>A look behind the scenes of today's Sally Ride doodle, narrated by the artist of the doodle, Olivia Huynh, and Tam O'Shaughnessy</i></div>
<br />
Looking back at Earth through the window of the space shuttle, Sally was moved by the view of our beautiful blue planet wrapped in its thin blanket of air. She realized how important it is for all of us to take care of our fragile home in space, and became an environmentalist. Many years later, we wrote books for young adults about Earth’s changing climate.<br />
<br />
After leaving NASA, Sally became a professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego. She loved being a scientist, but she was concerned that many young people—especially girls and minority students—abandon their early interest in science and math. <br />
<br />
Studies show that the reason kids turn away from STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) is not that they don’t like it or aren’t good it. Instead, young people get turned off because society sends false messages about who scientists are, what they do, and how they work. So Sally decided to use her high profile to motivate young people to stick with their interest in science and to consider pursuing STEM careers. <br />
<br />
In 2001, Sally and I and three friends started Sally Ride Science to create programs and publications that bring science to life and show young people that STEM is fascinating, creative, and fun. Since then, we’ve trained thousands of teachers on how to spark and sustain interest in STEM and reached millions of students with our books and programs. <br />
<br />
Sally died almost three years ago on July 23, 2012, from pancreatic cancer. But I know she would be honored by today’s <a href=""http://www.google.com/doodles/sally-rides-64th-birthday"">Google Doodle</a>. With whimsy, it expresses Sally’s sense of fun and adventure, and her ability to inspire young people. And who knows—maybe her Doodle will motivate some girl or boy somewhere in the world to become a scientist and adventurer just like Sally. <br />
<br />
Sally said it best . . .<br />
<blockquote>
<i>Everywhere I go I meet girls and boys who want to be astronauts and explore space, or they love the ocean and want to be oceanographers, or they love animals and want to be zoologists, or they love designing things and want to be engineers. I want to see those same stars in their eyes in 10 years and know they are on their way!</i></blockquote>

<br />
<b>Deadly biker brawl</b><br />
A shooting between rival motorcycle gangs in Waco, Texas, left nine dead and more than 170 people in jail this week. There were more than 500,000 searches for “<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Waco+shooting&amp;std=20150517&amp;pn=p1#a=20150517-Waco+shooting"">Waco shooting</a>” on Sunday as people asked questions like “What biker gangs are in Texas?” and “What county is Waco, Texas in?” to try to understand why the shooting may have happened.<br />
<br />
<b>An NBA family affair</b><br />
The <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=NBA+Playoffs&amp;std=20150520&amp;pn=p1#a=20150520-NBA+Playoffs"">NBA playoffs</a> continue to be a top topic in search as the conference finals began this week, with the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets matchup garnering the most attention. (The Cavaliers made the trends charts on Wednesday, but otherwise all eyes are on the West.) After going down 2-0 to the Warriors, the Rockets are in the spotlight, with <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Houston+Rockets&amp;std=20150520&amp;pn=p1#a=20150520-Houston+Rockets"">200,000+ searches</a> following their game 1 loss.

There were 50,000+ searches for his mom, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Sonya+Curry&amp;std=20150520&amp;pn=p1#a=20150520-Sonya+Curry"">Sonya Curry</a>, after she appeared looking <a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/sports/ci_28151682/twitter-approves-stephen-currys-mom-sonya-after-she"">ageless</a> at Tuesday’s game, while others were interested in his daughter <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evjJJoEONgo"">Riley’s post-game press conference hijinks</a>. In fact, three out of the top five Curry-related searches on Wednesday were about his family.<br />
<br />
<b>Thanks, Dave</b><br />
David Letterman ended his 33-year career in late-night TV on Wednesday night. His farewell show featured favorite clips from the past, some classic Dave self-deprecation and a Top 10 list to top all Top 10 lists starring celebs like Steve Martin, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and (Dave’s apparent favorite) Peyton Manning. Dave was at the top of the search list, too, with more than <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=David+Letterman&amp;std=20150520&amp;pn=p1#a=20150520-David+Letterman"">500,000+ searches</a>—consider it a small consolation <a href=""http://www.etonline.com/tv/164886_david_letterman_says_goodbye_to_late_show/"">for not getting “The Tonight Show.”</a> Top <a href=""https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/600722070960533505"">questions</a> leading up to the last show included “How tall is David Letterman?” and “Who is taking over for Letterman?” (Answer: someone else who brought a crew of celebs to his <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_final_episode_of_The_Colbert_Report"">final show last December</a>.)<br />

The movie, a dystopian thriller set in Australia starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Mad+Max&amp;std=20150514&amp;pn=p1#a=20150514-Mad+Max"">appeared</a> on the Hot Trends list <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Mad+Max+Fury+Road&amp;std=20150511&amp;pn=p1#a=20150511-Mad+Max+Fury+Road"">twice</a> this week, with more than 500,000 searches yesterday. <br />
<br />
While a battle for survival in the Outback takes place on screen, a real-life high-stakes story was playing out this week in Australia. The government told the actor Johnny Depp that he had to <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/14/asia/johnny-depps-dogs-travel-rules/"">remove his two Yorkie dogs</a> from the country by Saturday or they would be euthanized. Australia has strict laws about bringing animals into the country, and Boo and Pistol hadn’t followed proper procedure. There were <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Johnny+Depp&amp;std=20150514&amp;pn=p1#a=20150514-Johnny+Depp"">more than 50,000 searches</a> in the U.S. for the actor as people followed the doggie drama. But that’s nothing compared to searches in Australia:<br />

Today, people are saying goodbye to B.B. King, who died yesterday at the age of 89. The blues guitarist (the name “B.B.” comes from “Blues Boy”) was a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/16/arts/music/b-b-king-blues-singer-dies-at-89.html"">legend</a> in music circles, and influenced stars like Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. More than half a million searches and an outpouring of memories followed the news of his death. <br />
<br />
“American Idol” fans are saying farewell to the popular Fox show. “Idol” crowned its 14th winner this week, <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/05/13/american-idol-crowns-its-14th-champion/"">Connecticut-based Nick Fradiani</a>, and announced that next season will be its last. There were <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=American+Idol&amp;std=20150513&amp;pn=p1#a=20150513-American+Idol"">more than 200K searches</a> for the show the day of the finale and announcement. And elsewhere in long-running Fox TV series news, “The Simpsons” voice actor <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Harry+Shearer&amp;std=20150514&amp;pn=p1#a=20150514-Harry+Shearer"">Harry Shearer</a> (the voice of Mr. Burns, Ned Flanders and many other beloved yellow characters), won’t be back for the show’s 27th season. Show co-creator James L. Brooks <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-harry-shearer-will-be-replaced-on-the-simpsons-producer-says-20150514-story.html"">isn’t giving up hope</a>, though, and neither, it seems, are searchers, who sent Shearer into the top charts yesterday.<br />
<br />
<b>Ladies in green</b><br />
Searches spiked for <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Harriet+Tubman&amp;std=20150512&amp;pn=p1#a=20150512-Harriet+Tubman"">Harriet Tubman</a> this week after the abolitionist and Underground Railroad hero won an online poll about who should be the new face of the $20 bill. More than 600K people voted in the Women on 20s campaign, in the end choosing Tubman over Eleanor Roosevelt by a slim margin. The petition would need to be <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/13/406452142/harriet-tubman-wins-unofficial-contest-to-be-on-20-bill"">approved</a> by the Secretary of the Treasury.<br />
<br />
Regardless of whose face is on the front, you’d need 8 million 20s to buy “Women in Algiers,” the Picasso painting that broke records this week at Christie’s in New York when it sold for $160 million. The anonymous buyer made the cubist painting the most expensive to ever sell at auction, and now it’s the top Picasso painting in search to boot. <br />

2053684444632452571,,Google Blogs,2015-05-15T00:00:00-07:00,Green lights for our self-driving vehicle prototypes,"When we started <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/just-press-go-designing-self-driving.html"">designing the world’s first fully self-driving vehicle</a>, our goal was a vehicle that could shoulder the entire burden of driving.  Vehicles that can take anyone from A to B at the push of a button could transform mobility for millions of people, whether by reducing the <a href=""http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pubs/812115.pdf"">94 percent of accidents caused by human error</a>&nbsp;(PDF), reclaiming the billions of hours wasted in traffic, or bringing everyday destinations and new opportunities within reach of those who might otherwise be excluded by their inability to drive a car. <br />
<br />
Now we’re announcing the next step for our project: this summer, a few of the prototype vehicles we’ve created will leave the test track and hit the familiar roads of Mountain View, Calif., with our safety drivers aboard.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XYZaPoEQw54/VVVH_dnEySI/AAAAAAAAQSE/ybYRvn5dbrM/s1600/png%3Bbase64393abaebbf084743.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XYZaPoEQw54/VVVH_dnEySI/AAAAAAAAQSE/ybYRvn5dbrM/s600/png%3Bbase64393abaebbf084743.png"" /></a></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i>Our safety drivers will test fully self-driving vehicle prototypes like this one on the streets of Mountain View, Calif., this summer.</i></div><br />
We’ve been running the vehicles through rigorous testing at our test facilities, and ensuring our software and sensors work as they’re supposed to on this new vehicle. The new prototypes will drive with the same software that our existing fleet of self-driving <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-self-driving-car-logs-more-miles-on.html"">Lexus RX450h SUVs</a> uses. That fleet has logged nearly a million autonomous miles on the roads since we started the project, and recently has been self-driving about 10,000 miles a week. So the new prototypes already have lots of experience to draw on—in fact, it’s the equivalent of about 75 years of typical American adult driving experience. <br />
<div style=""text-align: center;""><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/uCezICQNgJU"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
</div>Each prototype’s speed is capped at a neighborhood-friendly 25mph, and during this next phase of our project we’ll have safety drivers aboard with a removable steering wheel, accelerator pedal, and brake pedal that allow them to take over driving if needed.  We’re looking forward to learning how the community perceives and interacts with the vehicles, and to uncovering challenges that are unique to a fully self-driving vehicle—e.g., where it should stop if it can’t stop at its exact destination due to construction or congestion. In the coming years, we’d like to run small pilot programs with our prototypes to learn what people would like to do with vehicles like this. If you’d like to follow updates about the project and share your thoughts, please join us on our <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+SelfDrivingCar"">Google+ page</a>. See you on the road!<br />

7988764648854540096,,Google Blogs,2015-05-14T15:22:00-07:00,"New data, more facts: an update to the Transparency Report ","We first launched the <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/"">Transparency Report</a> in 2010 to help the public learn about the scope of government requests for user data. With recent <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/what.html"">revelations</a> about government surveillance, <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/feds-put-heat-on-web-firms-for-master-encryption-keys/"">calls for companies to make encryption keys</a> available to police, and a wide range of <a href=""http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=USC-RULES-CR-2014-0004-0029"">proposals</a>, both in and out of the U.S., to expand surveillance powers throughout the world, the issues today are more complicated than ever. Some issues, like <a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/congress-renews-push-to-require-search-warrants-for-email-snooping-20150203"">ECPA reform</a>, are less complex, and we’re encouraged by the broad support in Congress <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/699?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22h.r.+699%22%5D%7D"">for</a> <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/356?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22electronic+communications+privacy+act+amendments+act%22%5D%7D"">legislation</a> that would codify a standard requiring warrants for communications content.<br />
<br />
Google’s position remains consistent: We respect the important role of the government in investigating and combating security threats, and we comply with valid legal process. At the same time, we’ll fight on behalf of our users against unlawful requests for data or mass surveillance. We also work to make sure surveillance laws are transparent, principled, and reasonable.<br />
<br />
<b>Today’s Transparency Report update</b><br />
With this in mind, we’re adding some new details to our Transparency Report that we’re releasing today.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Emergency disclosure requests. </b>We’ve expanded our reporting on requests for information we receive in emergency situations. These emergency disclosure requests come from government agencies seeking information to save the life of a person who is in peril (like a kidnapping victim), or to prevent serious physical injury (like a threatened school shooting). We have a process for evaluating and fast-tracking these requests, and in true emergencies we can provide the necessary data without delay. The Transparency Report previously included this number for the United States, but we’re now reporting for every country that submits this sort of request.</li>
<li><b>Preservation requests. </b>We’re also now reporting on government requests asking us to set aside information relating to a particular user’s account. These requests can be made so that information needed in an investigation is not lost while the government goes through the steps to get the formal legal process asking us to disclose the information. We call these ""preservation requests"" and because they don't always lead to formal data requests, we keep them separate from the country totals we report. Beginning with this reporting period, we’re reporting this number for every country.</li>
</ul>
<br />
In addition to this new data, the report shows that we’ve received 30,138 requests from around the world seeking information about more than 50,585 users/accounts; we provided information in response to 63 percent of those requests. We saw slight increases in the number of requests from governments in Europe (2 percent) and Asia/Pacific (7 percent), and a 22 percent increase in requests from governments in Latin America.<br />
<br />
<b>The fight for increased transparency</b><br />
Sometimes, laws and gag-orders prohibit us from notifying someone that a request for their data has been made. There are some situations where these restrictions make sense, and others not so much. We will fight—sometimes through lengthy court action—for our users’ right to know when data requests have been made. We’ve recently succeeded in a couple of important cases.<br />
<br />
First, after years of persistent litigation in which we fought for the right to inform Wikileaks of government requests for their data, we were successful in <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/google-says-it-fought-gag-orders-in-wikileaks-investigation/2015/01/28/e62bfd04-a5c9-11e4-a06b-9df2002b86a0_story.html"">unsealing court documents relating to these requests</a>. We’re now making those documents available to the public <a href=""https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5dcd1BnwkWGNFZmbjF3MnlqNGc/edit"">here</a> and <a href=""https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5dcd1BnwkWGRzlfQ3ZjS3FNYWc/edit"">here</a>. <br />
<br />
Second, we've fought to be more transparent regarding the U.S. government's use of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter"">National Security Letters</a>, or NSLs. An NSL is a special type of subpoena for user information that the FBI issues without prior judicial oversight. NSLs can include provisions prohibiting the recipient from disclosing any information about it. <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/08/26/open-secret-about-googles-surveillance-case-no-longer-secret/"">Reporters speculated in 2013</a> that we challenged the constitutionality of NSLs; after years of litigation with the government in several courts across multiple jurisdictions, we can now confirm that we challenged 19 NSLs and fought for our right to disclose this to the public. We also recently won the right to release additional information about those challenges and the documents should be available on the public court dockets soon.<br />
<br />
Finally, just yesterday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 338-88 to pass the <a href=""http://www.judiciary.house.gov/index.cfm/usa-freedom-act"">USA Freedom Act of 2015</a>. This represents a significant step toward broader surveillance reform, while preserving important national security authorities.

<br />
<b>The princess and the Parliament</b><br />
The Duke and Duchess welcomed their second child, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge, this week—setting off a wave of <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=royal+baby&amp;std=20150502&amp;pn=p1#a=20150502-royal+baby"">royal baby</a> fervor worldwide.

<b> From Jedi robes to couture gowns</b><br />
Fans around the world donned their best Princess Leia and Stormtrooper costumes for Star Wars Day on Monday. Celebrated on May 4 (<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=May+the+4th+Be+With+You&amp;std=20150504&amp;pn=p1#a=20150504-May+the+4th+Be+With+You"">May the Fourth Be with You</a>, get it?) thanks in large part to the Internet, the holiday has been growing for the past few years in search, but we saw the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=star%20wars%20day&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">biggest spike yet</a> in 2015. In addition to Leia and Stormtrooper, top costume searches on Monday include [yoda dog] and [female jedi costume]. Interest in the upcoming movie “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” doubled, and other popular questions include “Is Star Wars on Netflix?” and “What order should you watch Star Wars?” <br />

There were more than a million searches in the U.S. on Tuesday for Cinco de Mayo—in fact, for the past two years more searches for the holiday have taken place in the U.S. than in Mexico. As people looked into the history of the holiday, common questions include “Who won the Battle of Puebla?” and “What caused the conflict that led to the Battle of Puebla?” But for the most part, people seem to be in it for the food (and, we assume, the margaritas). <br />

2571891622342413300,,Google Blogs,2015-05-05T14:00:00-07:00,Doing more on diversity,"When we <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/getting-to-work-on-diversity-at-google.html"">released</a> the composition of our workforce almost a year ago, it confirmed what many people suspected: the tech industry needs to do a lot more when it comes to diversity. Since then, the question I get asked most is—so what are you doing about it? <br />
<br />
You may have heard about some of the work we’ve been doing: <a href=""http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4312d33e1cb8454a9885f230d35f0eb1/google-embeds-engineers-professors"">embedding engineers</a> at Historically Black Colleges and Universities; <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/03/18/google-abc-disney-pair-up-to-promote-images-of-girls-and-computer-science/24903551/"">partnering with Hollywood</a> to inspire girls to pursue careers in computer science; building <a href=""http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20141003/PC1213/141009834/1003/"">local initiatives</a> to introduce coding to high school students from diverse communities; and expanding our employee unconscious bias <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/you-dont-know-what-you-dont-know-how.html"">training</a>.  <br />
<br />
But these programs represent only a sampling of all the work that is going on behind the scenes. If we’re really going to make an impact, we need a holistic plan. Today, we want to <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/05/05/google-raises-stakes-diversity-spending/26868359/"">share</a> our diversity strategy, which is focused on four key areas: <br />
<br />
<b>Hire diverse Googlers: </b>In the past, our university-focused hiring programs have relied heavily on a relatively small number of schools. But, we know those schools aren't always the most diverse. For example, while <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=98"">14% of Hispanic college enrollment is at 4-year schools</a>, Hispanics make up just <a href=""https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/06/18/new-book-discusses-diversity-strategies-dont-consider-race#sthash.PJ6995ZV.HyygIdnv.dpbs"">7% at the 200 most selective schools</a>. In the past two years, we've doubled the number of schools where we recruit, to promote student diversity. This year, nearly 20 percent of the hires we make from a university are from these new campuses.<br />
<br />
<b>Foster a fair and inclusive culture:</b> We want to ensure that we have an environment where all Googlers can thrive. We’ve raised awareness around <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/you-dont-know-what-you-dont-know-how.html"">unconscious bias</a>—half of all Googlers have participated in our unconscious bias workshops—and we’ve now rolled out a hands-on workshop that provides practical tips for addressing bias when we see it. We’re also drawing on the idea of <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/05/googles-20-percent-time-in-action.html"">20 percent</a> time to enable employees to use their time at work to focus on diversity projects. In 2015, more than 500 Googlers will participate in Diversity Core, a formal program in which employees contribute—as part of their job—to the company’s diversity efforts. <br />
<br />
<b>Expand the pool of technologists:</b> Making computer science (CS) education accessible and available to everyone is one of our most important initiatives. Our <a href=""http://www.cs-first.com/"">CS First</a> program is designed to help anyone—a teacher, a coach, or volunteer—teach kids the basics of coding. And since <a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/file/d/0B-E2rcvhnlQ_a1Q4VUxWQ2dtTHM/edit"">research</a> tells us that to inspire more girls, we need to show them that computer science isn’t just for boys, we started <a href=""http://madewithcode.com/"">Made with Code</a>—and we’re working with the entertainment industry to <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/03/18/google-abc-disney-pair-up-to-promote-images-of-girls-and-computer-science/24903551/"">change the perceptions around CS</a> and what it means to be a computer scientist.<br />
<br />
<b>Bridge the digital divide:</b> We also want more underrepresented communities, including women and minorities, to share the benefits of the web, and to have access to the economic engine it provides. The <a href=""http://accelerate.withgoogle.com/"">Accelerate with Google Academy</a> helps business owners get online, grow and drive economic impact. <br />
<br />
With an organization of our size, meaningful change will take time. From one year to the next, bit by bit, our progress will inch forward. More importantly, our industry will become more inclusive, and the opportunities for currently underrepresented groups will grow. We’ll share our updated diversity data for 2015 soon. We’re gradually making progress across these four areas, and we’re in it for the long term.<br />

He concurred and gave me a 7th grade algebra book because he believed in me. I spent the summer working through every problem! With that simple act, Mr. Tomazewski had set me off on a career path that eventually led to the <a href=""http://internethalloffame.org/inductees/vint-cerf"">invention of the Internet</a>.<br />

As students, we have the potential to be or do anything—whether and how we fulfill that potential is largely determined by the guidance and encouragement of our teachers. <br />
<br />
That’s one reason why Google is so committed to improving teaching and learning through the use of technology. One year ago this week, <a href=""//googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/previewing-new-classroom.html"">we announced Classroom</a>, a tool that helps teachers manage assignments, communicate with students and parents, and stay organized. Since then, we’ve continued to add features that teachers and students tell us they need, and if you stay tuned to the <a href=""http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/"">Google for Education Blog</a> this week, you’ll hear about a few of our newest additions.  <br />
<br />
In the spirit of listening to our teachers, we’re also continuing to improve our <a href=""http://www.cs-first.com/"">CS First</a> materials—free online computer science content developed by educators and computer scientists—to help introduce the art of programming to students in grades 4-8 through after-school, in-school and summer programs.<br />
<br />
We also realize the importance of what teachers can learn from one another. So with that in mind, this week we’re hosting <a href=""https://educationonair.withgoogle.com/live/2015-may?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=2015-EDU-NA-EDU-EDU-AIR-Blogs&amp;utm_content="">Education on Air</a>—a free online event with 100+ sessions led by educators from 12 countries and 29 U.S. states. We’ll cover themes that include empowering students, practical innovation, CS and STEM, and building community. Speakers include LeVar Burton and Google Science Fair 2012 winner Brittany Wenger. We hope you can virtually join us May 8-9 for this online education conference, and <a href=""https://educationonair.withgoogle.com/live/2015-may?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=2015-EDU-NA-EDU-EDU-AIR-Blogs&amp;utm_content="">make sure to register</a> so you can catch recorded videos of all the sessions. <br />

1771686003237871747,,Google Blogs,2015-05-04T21:00:00-07:00,What Girls are Good For: Happy birthday Nellie Bly! ,"In 1880, the Pittsburgh <i>Dispatch</i> published an article titled ""What Girls Are Good For.” In dismissive terms, the column’s author wrote that women shouldn't be allowed to work because their place was at home. <br />
<br />
Days later, a pseudonymous rebuttal appeared in the paper. The response, by a 16-year-old girl whose real name was Elizabeth Jane Cochran, argued how important it was for women to be independent and self-reliant. Within a decade, the author of that response would become known worldwide as Nellie Bly: a hard-hitting young journalist who went undercover at a lunatic asylum and traveled around the world in a record-breaking 72 days. <br />
<br />
Throughout her life and career, Nellie Bly spoke up for the underprivileged, the helpless and minorities, and defied society’s expectations for women. We love her adventurous spirit, and we share her belief that women can do anything and be anything they want (we like to think if she were around today she’d be a fellow fan of trailblazing women like <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/12/honouring-computings-1843-visionary.html"">Ada</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/anitaborg/"">Anita</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=79&amp;v=yrnNmzSSn0w"">Ann</a>). So when it came time to honor Nellie with a <a href=""https://g.co/doodle/pd56hz"">Doodle</a>, we wanted to make it special. <a href=""http://www.karenomusic.com/"">Karen O</a> of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs wrote, composed and recorded an original song about Nellie, and Katy Wu, the artist who created this doodle, created an animation set to Karen O’s music celebrating this intrepid investigative reporter. <br />
<div style=""text-align: center;""><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""338"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/BrrgeZKvFEo"" width=""600""></iframe><br />
</div>Nellie was born on May 5, 1864 in a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pa. After her response was published in the <i>Dispatch</i> in 1880, the editor, George Madden, tracked her down and hired her as a reporter. At the time, women reporters commonly used pen names; hers came from a song by fellow Pittsburgher <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Foster"">Stephen Foster</a>. She spent several years at the paper before moving to New York for a job at New York World, which was owned by Joseph Pulitzer. In 1887, she went undercover at the Women's Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell's Island to write an exposé about the conditions there. Her resulting book, “Ten Days in a Mad-House,” made her famous. <br />
<br />
But Nellie is best known for her trip around the world. Inspired by Phileas Fogg, the hero of Jules Verne’s novel, “Around the World in 80 Days,” Nellie set sail from New York in November 1889 determined to beat Fogg’s time. Traveling by steamships and sailboats, she sent dispatches back to her newspaper as she circled the globe. Instead of sitting idly and just observing, she was always a part of the action and conversation, despite the fact that public spaces were typically reserved for men at the time.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9YiO4jSqghw/VUgzXa3hktI/AAAAAAAAQJs/NvGWO80D2Zw/s1600/png%3Bbase64acb9b511c3b1ba09.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9YiO4jSqghw/VUgzXa3hktI/AAAAAAAAQJs/NvGWO80D2Zw/s640/png%3Bbase64acb9b511c3b1ba09.png"" /></a></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i>Storyboard for today's Nellie Bly video doodle, by Katy Wu</i></div><br />
When creating the Doodle, we took inspiration from Karen O’s lyrics and Nellie’s journey around the globe. Throughout the video, Katy used newspaper as a unifying theme—with paper tearing, folding and crumpling as the story goes along. And though the video is mostly black and white, she added some color to represent Nellie's energy and vibrancy. <br />
<br />
Back in the 19th century, Nellie fearlessly showed a generation of people “what girls are good for.” We’re excited to tell her story in today’s Doodle—and we hope Nellie inspires women and girls everywhere to follow in her footsteps and show the world what they can do.<br />

745591176226371460,,Google Blogs,2015-04-22T10:34:00-07:00,Say hi to Fi: A new way to say hello ,"In today's mobile world, fast and reliable connectivity is almost second nature. But even in places like the U.S., where mobile connections are nearly ubiquitous, there are still times when you turn to your phone for that split-second answer and don't have fast enough speed. Or you can't get calls and texts because you left your phone in a taxi (or it got lost in a couch cushion for the day). As mobile devices continually improve how you connect to people and information, it's important that wireless connectivity and communication keep pace and be fast everywhere, easy to use, and accessible to everyone. <br />
<br />
That's why today we’re introducing Project Fi, a program to explore this opportunity by introducing new ideas through a fast and easy wireless experience. Similar to our Nexus hardware program, Project Fi enables us to work in close partnership with leading carriers, hardware makers, and all of you to push the boundaries of what's possible. By designing across hardware, software and connectivity, we can more fully explore new ways for people to connect and communicate. Two of the top mobile networks in the U.S.—Sprint and T-Mobile—are partnering with us to launch Project Fi and now you can be part of the project too. <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xfFHnBQ6nQg"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
Our three focus areas include: <br />
<br />
<b>Helping you get the highest-quality connection</b><br />
Project Fi aims to put you on the best network wherever you go. As you move around, the best network for you might be a Wi-Fi hotspot or a specific 4G LTE network. We developed new technology that gives you better coverage by intelligently connecting you to the fastest available network at your location whether it's Wi-Fi or one of our two partner LTE networks. As you go about your day, Project Fi automatically connects you to more than a million free, open Wi-Fi hotspots we've verified as fast and reliable. Once you're connected, we help secure your data through encryption. When you're not on Wi-Fi, we move you between whichever of our partner networks is delivering the fastest speed, so you get 4G LTE in more places. <a href=""http://fi.google.com/about/network/"">Learn more about our network of networks. </a><br />
<br />
<b>Enabling easy communication across networks and devices</b><br />
Project Fi works to get technology out of the way so you can communicate through whichever network type and device you're using. Wherever you're connected to Wi-Fi—whether that's at home, your favorite coffee shop or your Batcave—you can talk and text like you normally do. If you leave an area of Wi-Fi coverage, your call will seamlessly transition from Wi-Fi to cell networks so your conversation doesn’t skip a beat. We also want to help phone numbers adapt to a multi-screen world. With Project Fi, your phone number lives in the cloud, so you can talk and text with your number on just about any phone, tablet or laptop. So the next time you misplace your phone, you can stay connected using another screen. <a href=""http://fi.google.com/about/experience"">Check out how it works.</a><br />
<br />
<b>Making the service experience as simple as possible</b><br />
Project Fi takes a fresh approach to how you pay for wireless, manage your service, and get in touch when you need help. We offer one simple plan at one price with 24/7 support. Here's how it works: for $20 a month you get all the basics (talk, text, Wi-Fi tethering, and international coverage in 120+ countries), and then it's a flat $10 per GB for cellular data while in the U.S. and abroad. 1GB is $10/month, 2GB is $20/month, 3GB is $30/month, and so on. Since it's hard to predict your data usage, you'll get credit for the full value of your unused data. Let's say you go with 3GB for $30 and only use 1.4GB one month. You'll get $16 back, so you only pay for what you use. <a href=""http://fi.google.com/about/plan/"">Get all the details about our plan.</a><br />
<b><br /></b>
<b>Be part of the project from the start</b><br />
We're beginning Project Fi's Early Access Program to invite people to sign up for the service. Project Fi will be available on the Nexus 6, which we developed with Motorola and is the first smartphone that supports the hardware and software to work with our service. If you live <a href=""http://fi.google.com/coverage"">where we have coverage</a> in the U.S., request an invite at <a href=""http://fi.google.com/"">fi.google.com</a>&nbsp;to get started. <br />
<br />
We look forward to connecting! <br />

Known now as “<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Day_%28South_Africa%29"">Freedom Day</a>,” that date has become a symbol of hope in South Africa and around the world. To commemorate this historic day, we’ve partnered with the <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/robben-island-museum"">Robben Island Museum</a> and the <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/nelson-mandela-centre-of-memory"">Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory</a> to bring the story of this UNESCO World Heritage Site online for the world to explore.

<br />
As a symbol of South Africa’s struggle for freedom, Robben Island has become a destination for people to connect with Mandela and other freedom fighters.

Formed of a series of interrelated bodies of water, including the River Oich to the south and the Bona Narrows to the north, Loch Ness stretches for 23 miles southwest of Inverness. Although it’s neither the largest Scottish loch by surface area nor depth, it is the largest by volume, containing more freshwater than all the lakes of England and Wales combined. And at almost 800 feet deep, there’s an entire world below the surface, giving rise to the Nessie legend.<br />

So&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.android.com/wear"">Android Wear</a>&nbsp;offers a range of watches and apps that are fashionable as well as functional.<br />
<br />
Over the past few months we’ve added lots of ways to express your style—from&nbsp;<a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/12/android-dress-code-wear-what-you-want.html"">custom watch faces</a>&nbsp;to a&nbsp;<a href=""http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2015/04/android-wear-even-more-ways-to-wear.html"">rainbow of bands</a>. Today we’re making Android Wear more helpful as well—getting you what you need, right on your wrist.<br />
<br />
<b>Always-on screen, always-on apps</b><br />
<br />
When you buy a watch you want it to, well, tell the time. So most Android Wear watches include an always-on screen—no tapping, twisting or shaking required to see what time it is. Now we’re expanding this option to apps, so they can stay visible as long as you need them, instead of disappearing when you drop your arm. In either case the screen is only full color when you're actively looking at it—so you get the info you need, and you save on battery life.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l9wXeyKxHv8/VTSFYePsgyI/AAAAAAAAAY0/2219XKH5w3A/s1600/alwayson_500.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l9wXeyKxHv8/VTSFYePsgyI/AAAAAAAAAY0/2219XKH5w3A/s1600/alwayson_500.gif"" /></a></div><br />
<b>Wi-Fi support</b><br />
<b><br />
</b>With GPS and offline music support, you can already leave your phone at home, then go&nbsp;<a href=""http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2014/10/jogging-and-jamming-with-android-wear.html"">jogging and jamming</a>&nbsp;like normal. Now Android Wear supports watches with built-in Wi-Fi. As long as your watch is connected to a Wi-Fi network, and your phone has a data connection (wherever it is), you’ll be able to get notifications, send messages, and use all your favorite apps. And if you really do forget your phone, you can always&nbsp;<a href=""http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2015/03/keep-watch-on-your-phone.html"">ask your watch</a>&nbsp;where it is.<br />
<br />
<b>Simpler, faster, and more smiley</b><br />
<br />
When it comes to your watch, using apps should be as simple as checking the time. So today we’re making a number of Android Wear improvements to help you access your info, and express yourself more easily:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>Got your hands full? You no longer need them to check your news and notifications. Instead you can just&nbsp;<a href=""http://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/wristgesture_500.gif"">flick your wrist</a>&nbsp;to scroll through the stream.</li>

<b>Best I ever had?</b><br />
In the land of music festivals, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Coachella&amp;std=20150410&amp;pn=p1#a=20150410-Coachella"">Coachella</a> is the biggest of them all. With thousands of fans and celebrities swarming to the California desert to party, there’s bound to be a couple of surprises throughout the weekend’s shenanigans. This year, rapper Drake got a little more than he expected when he brought <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Madonna&amp;std=20150413&amp;pn=p1#a=20150413-Madonna"">Madonna</a> on stage as a guest performer. The pop singer, never one to shy away from scandal, decided it was entirely appropriate to <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/13/entertainment/feat-madonna-kiss-drake/"">make out</a> with Drake–on stage, in front of everyone and, apparently, without his consent. The shocking liplock swept the Internet off its feet (mainly because Drake seemed horrified by the experience). Nonetheless, searches for Madonna hit 500,000+ and Drake reached his <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F05mt_q&amp;date=today%2012-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">highest peak</a> in queries so far this year. But everything’s still good between the two: Drake <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/14/drake-madonna-kiss-response_n_7061150.html"">responded</a> to the commotion on Instagram. “Don't misinterpret my shock!!” he wrote in a comment. “I got to make out with the queen Madonna and I feel 100 about that forever.”<br />
<br />
We’re willing to bet that pro golfer <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Jordan+Spieth&amp;std=20150411&amp;pn=p1#a=20150411-Jordan+Spieth"">Jordan Spieth</a> is having the best week of his life after he <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/sports/features/jordan-spieth-golfs-heir-apparent-wins-the-masters-20150413"">won</a> the Masters Tournament and became the competition's second youngest winner after Tiger Woods at the age of 21. Spieth took home <a href=""http://www.cbssports.com/golf/eye-on-golf/25147737/jordan-spieths-masters-win-is-worth-much-more-than-just-prize-money"">$1.8 million</a> in prize money and more than a half million searches–sounds like a good day on the greens to us.<br />

Campaign season is back in full force this week. Former Secretary of State <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Hillary+Clinton&amp;std=20150412&amp;pn=p1#a=20150412-Hillary+Clinton"">Hillary Clinton</a> revealed America’s worst kept secret, announcing her presidential run with a YouTube video. Meanwhile, the list of contenders for the Republican nomination grows every week —Senator <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Marco+Rubio&amp;std=20150413&amp;pn=p1#a=20150413-Marco+Rubio"">Marco Rubio</a> threw his name into the hat ring as well. Queries for both nominees nearly crossed a million as people turned to the web to find more details about their political positions and track records. <br />
<br />
Back in D.C., the latest distraction came in the form of a <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Gyrocopter&amp;std=20150415&amp;pn=p1#a=20150415-Gyrocopter"">gyrocopter.</a> In a bid to stir the debate about campaign finance reform, pilot Doug Hughes (illegally) landed a gyroplane on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol. The stunt is <a href=""http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/gyrocopter-flight-raises-profile-on-campaign-finance-reform-but-for-how/2225878"">getting people talking</a> about how much money candidates raise and spend during elections and boosting searches for gyrocopters to an <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Gyrocopter&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">all-time high</a>.<br />

Ever thought about working in the credit card business? Maybe you should reconsider your future plans. This week the CEO of <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Gravity+Payments&amp;std=20150414&amp;pn=p1#a=20150414-Gravity+Payments"">Gravity payments</a>, a credit card processing company, informed his employees that he was <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gravity-payments-ceo-dan-prices-raise-minimum-pay-economics/"">raising the minimum salary</a> to $70,000–seriously! CEO Dan Price told the media he made the change as a way to confront income inequality. Buzz for the little-known company skyrocketed since the media caught wind of the announcement, with searches topping more than 100,000.<br />
<br />
<b>Tip of the week</b><br />
Can’t find your phone and starting to feel desperate? If you’re computer is nearby you can now ask Google to find your Android phone from your desktop. Just say, “find my phone” on Voice Search and Google will ring the phone for you. Just make sure you’ve got the latest version of the Google app installed on your device!﻿<br />

9182922246997919942,,European Public Policy Blog,2015-04-15T03:23:00-07:00,The Search for Harm,"In the summer of 2010, Google announced plans to acquire the flight search provider, ITA.  As we said at the time, while many people buy their airline tickets online, finding the right flight at the best price can be a real hassle.  Today Google Flight Search has made that much easier.  Search for ""Flight CDG to SFO"" and you get the different options right there on the results page.  It’s a great example of Google’s increasing ability to answer queries directly, saving people a lot of time and effort—because as Larry Page said over a decade ago “the perfect search engine should understand exactly what you mean and give you back exactly what you want.""<br />
<br />
At the time of the ITA acquisition, several online travel companies—Expedia, Kayak, and Travelocity--unsuccessfully lobbied regulators in the US and the European Union to block the deal, arguing that our ability to show flight options directly would siphon off their traffic and harm competition online.  Four years later it’s clear their allegations of harm turned out to be untrue.  As the <i><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/google-flight-search-four-years-in-success-or-not/2014/10/02/bfb69036-45ab-11e4-9a15-137aa0153527_story.html"">Washington Post</a> </i>recently pointed out (in an article headed “Google Flight Search, four years in:  not the competition-killer critics feared”) Expedia, Orbitz, Priceline and Travelocity account for 95% of the US online travel market today.  It’s a similar situation in Europe too, as this graph for Germany neatly shows:<br />
<br />
<b>Travel sites in Germany</b><br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j2NSQNkMoww/VS6Du6_AKPI/AAAAAAAAQCE/mHPzyDfMAUA/s1600/travel%2Bsites%2Bin%2Bgermany.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j2NSQNkMoww/VS6Du6_AKPI/AAAAAAAAQCE/mHPzyDfMAUA/s1600/travel%2Bsites%2Bin%2Bgermany.png"" height=""436"" width=""640"" /></a></div><i>Source: ComScore MMX and Google data (for Google), desktop traffic, unique visitors (‘000s)</i><span id=""goog_1386856001""></span><br />
<br />
We’ve seen similar <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/10/us-eu-google-antitrust-insight-idUSKBN0N022E20150410"">allegations</a> of harm from competitors in other areas.  And the European Commission today confirmed that it is sending Google a Statement of Objections (SO) regarding the display and ranking of shopping results.   <br />
<br />
While Google may be the most used search engine, people can now find and access information in numerous different ways—and allegations of harm, for consumers <u>and</u> competitors, have proved to be wide of the mark.   <br />
<br />
<b>More choice than ever before</b><br />
In fact, people have more choice than ever before.<br />
<br />
<ul><li>There are numerous other search engines such as Bing, Yahoo, Quora, DuckDuckGo and a new wave of search assistants like Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana.</li>
<li>In addition, there are a ton of specialized services like Amazon, Idealo, Le Guide, Expedia or eBay.  For example, Amazon, eBay, and Axel Springer’s Idealo are the three most popular shopping services in Germany.</li>
<li>People are increasingly using social sites like Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter to find recommendations, such as where to eat, which movies to watch or how to decorate their homes.</li>
<li>When it comes to news, users have many ways to reach their favorite sites. For example, <i>Bild</i> gets more than 85% of its traffic from sources other than Google and other search engines.*</li>
</ul><br />
Of course mobile is changing things as well.  Today <a href=""http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2014/The-US-Mobile-App-Report"">7 out of every 8 minutes</a> on mobile devices is spent within apps—in other words consumers are going to whichever websites or apps serve them best.  And they face no friction or costs in switching between them.  Yelp, for example, has told investors they get over 40% of their searches direct from their mobile apps.* So while in many ways it’s flattering to be described as a gatekeeper, the facts don’t actually bear that out.<br />
<br />
<b>Thriving competition online</b><br />
Which brings me to the competition.  Companies like Axel Springer, Expedia, TripAdvisor, and Yelp (all vociferous complainants in this process) have alleged that Google’s practice of including our specialized results (Flight Search, Maps, Local results, etc.) in search has significantly harmed their businesses.  But their traffic, revenues and profits (as well as the pitch they make to investors) tell a very different story.<br />
<br />
<ul><li>Yelp calls itself the “de facto local search engine” and has seen revenue growth of over 350% in the last four years.</li>
<li>TripAdvisor claims to be the Web’s largest travel brand and has nearly doubled its revenues in the last four years.</li>
<li>Expedia has grown its revenues by more than 67% over the same period—and recently told investors:  <i>“We're seeing increased traffic coming through Google Hotel Finder.  It is ­clearly getting more exposure. And in general … the product continues to improve.  And Google has invested in it, we'll continue to invest in it … From our standpoint, we're happy to play in any market that Google puts out there and over a long period of time, we have proven an ability to get our fair share in the Google marketplaces.” </i>(Remarkable given their complaints.)</li>
<li>Axel Springer continues to invest in search, including the French search engine Qwant, because as the company told investors, “<a href=""http://www.axelspringer.de/en/presse/Axel-Springer-Digital-Ventures-is-participating-in-French-startup-Qwant.com_21308881.html"">there is a lot of innovation on the search market</a>.”</li>

Indeed if you look at shopping—an area where we have seen a lot of complaints and where the European Commission has focused in its Statement of Objections—it’s clear that (a) there’s a ton of competition (including from Amazon and eBay, two of the biggest shopping sites in the world) and (b) Google’s shopping results have not harmed the competition.  Take a look at these graphs:<br />

Any economist would say that you typically do not see a ton of innovation, new entrants or investment in sectors where competition is stagnating—or dominated by one player.  Yet that is exactly what’s happening in our world.  Zalando, the German shopping site, went public in 2014 in one of Europe’s biggest-ever tech IPOs.  Companies like Facebook, Pinterest and Amazon have been investing in their own search services and search engines like Quixey, DuckDuckGo and Qwant have attracted new funding.  We’re seeing innovation in voice search and the rise of search assistants—with even more to come.<br />
<br />
It’s why we respectfully <u>but</u> strongly disagree with the need to issue a Statement of Objections and look forward to making our case over the weeks ahead. <br />

3925028378842550156,,European Public Policy Blog,2015-04-15T03:22:00-07:00,Android has helped create more choice and innovation on mobile than ever before,"It's hard to believe, but smartphones barely existed ten years ago.  People used feature phones, which had very basic functionality, and were a nightmare for developers.  The only way to build apps was device by device and platform by platform—Google had a closet full of hundreds of phones that we tested one by one each time we wanted to launch new software.  <br />
<br />
Android was born from this frustration.  We hoped that by offering a great, free open-source operating system, we could turbocharge innovation by allowing manufacturers and developers to focus on what they do best.  At the time, most people thought this plan was nuts.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to today.  The pace of mobile innovation has never been greater.  Smartphones are being adopted globally at an increasingly fast pace, with over hundreds of millions shipped each quarter, and the average smartphone price fell 23% between <a href=""http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24461213"">2012</a> and <a href=""http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25282214"">2014</a>.  It’s now possible to purchase a powerful smartphone, without subsidies or contracts, for under $100.  And the app ecosystem has exploded, giving consumers more choice than ever before.<br />
<br />
Android has been a key player in spurring this competition and choice, lowering prices and increasing choice for everyone (there are over <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/article/devs-now-have-over-18000-different-android-devices-to-tweak-apps-for/"">18,000</a> different devices available today);<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>It’s an open-source operating system that can be used <a href=""https://source.android.com/"">free-of-charge</a> by anyone—that’s right, literally anyone.  And it’s not just phones.  Today people are building almost anything with Android—including tablets, watches, TVs, cars, and more.  Some Android devices use Google services, and <a href=""https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/platforms/android-fireos"">others</a> do not.</li>
<li>Our Google Play store contains over one million apps and we paid out over $7 billion in revenue over the past year to developers and content publishers.</li>
<li>Apps that compete directly with Google such as Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft Office, and Expedia are easily available to Android users.  Indeed many of these apps come pre-loaded onto Android devices in addition to Google apps. The recent Samsung S6 is a great example of this, including pre-installed apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Google.</li>
<li>Developers have a choice of platforms and <a href=""http://www.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/q4-2013-devsurvey.pdf"">over 80% of developers</a> are building apps for several different mobile operating systems.</li>
</ul>
<br />
The European Commission has asked questions about our partner agreements.  It's important to remember that these are voluntary—again, you can use Android without Google—but provide real benefits to Android users, developers and the broader ecosystem.<br />
<br />
Anti-fragmentation agreements, for example, ensure apps work across all sorts of different Android devices. (After all, it would be pretty frustrating if an app you downloaded on one phone didn’t also work on your eventual replacement phone.)  And our app distribution agreements make sure that people get a great ""out of the box"" experience with useful apps right there on the home screen (how many of us could get through our day without maps or email?).  This also helps manufacturers of Android devices compete with Apple, Microsoft and other mobile ecosystems that come preloaded with similar baseline apps.  And remember that these distribution agreements are not exclusive, and Android manufacturers install their own apps and apps from other companies as well.  And in comparison to Apple—the world’s most profitable (mobile) phone company—there are far fewer Google apps pre-installed on Android phones than Apple apps on iOS devices.<br />
<br />
We are thankful for Android’s success and we understand that with success comes scrutiny.  But it's not just Google that has benefited from Android's success.  The Android model has let manufacturers compete on their unique innovations.  Developers can reach huge audiences and build strong businesses.  And consumers now have unprecedented choice at ever-lower prices.  We look forward to discussing these issues in more detail with the European Commission over the months ahead. <br />

8657461697474663755,,Google Blogs,2015-04-14T22:00:00-07:00,Opening the doors to the world-famous Abbey Road Studios,"On a leafy street in north London, next to a <a href=""http://www.abbeyroad.com/crossing"">popular zebra crossing</a>, is one of the world’s most celebrated music landmarks: Abbey Road Studios.<br />
<br />
Most people probably associate Abbey Road with the Beatles album of the same name. In fact, the studios have played a role in music history: if you can hum the theme to ""Star Wars,"" ""Harry Potter"" or ""Indiana Jones,"" or you’ve sung along to tracks by Pink Floyd or Oasis, or even if you own a pair of stereo headphones, then you’ve been impacted by the work of Abbey Road. Since opening in 1931, the studios have pushed the boundaries of music and sound, reinventing the recording process at every step. But until now, the famous crossing was as close as most of us could get to the studios.<br />
<br />
Now, for the first time, the doors at Abbey Road are open to everyone. In partnership with Abbey Road Studios, we’ve created <a href=""http://g.co/insideabbeyroad"">Inside Abbey Road</a>, an experience that lets fans around the world step inside the studios and explore this renowned institution.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGztmJrf748"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
Accessible via desktop, tablet and phone, you can explore every nook and cranny of Abbey Road with more than 150 different 360-degree panoramic images. As you walk through the studios, you’ll see YouTube videos and archival images from Abbey Road’s history—right where they originally happened. You can also play with pioneering equipment in specially designed interactive gadgets, such as the J37 4-track recorder that was used to record the Beatles’ <i>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.</i><br />
<br />
Throughout the studios you’ll find more than 30 stories, full of anecdotes and facts about the studios, like the story of Abbey Road engineer Alan Blumlein. Alan was annoyed after a trip to the movies, because the sound in early cinemas only came from one side of the screen. He went on to invent the concept of stereo audio—and sound and screen have matched ever since. Or, if you feel like being guided around the studios, there's an audio tour you can join in every studio. Narrated by producer Giles Martin, engineer and Head of Audio Products Mirek Stiles, and broadcaster Lauren Laverne, the audio tours let you see the studios through their eyes. Think of it as your own personal tour.<br />
<br />
Inside Abbey Road is part of our broader effort to help people experience worldwide culture and places from wherever they are, whether it’s visiting the Pyramids of Giza in Google Maps or getting up close to the brush strokes of Van Gogh in the Google Art Project. Now, we’re taking you behind the doors of one of the most famous music studios in the world. Take a step <a href=""http://g.co/insideabbeyroad"">Inside Abbey Road</a> and see for yourself.<br />

<b>Crime and punishment</b><br />
A white police officer in South Carolina was charged with the murder of an unarmed 50-year old black man this week. The officer, Michael T. Slager, claimed that he fired at Walter Scott because he feared for his safety, but a bystander’s video of the shooting showed Slager fire eight shots at Scott’s back as the man ran away. The video reignited debates about the use of lethal force by police, particularly against black men—a topic that has been in the news for months following the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York. Search interest in police brutality increased by 150 percent, and there were more than half a million searches for <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Walter+Scott&amp;std=20150407&amp;pn=p1#a=20150407-Walter+Scott"">Walter Scott</a> as people turned to the web to ask questions about how and why the event unfolded:<br />

Here’s a look at what people were searching for this week: <br />
<br />
<b>Germanwings Flight 9525</b><br />
On Tuesday, Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed in the French Alps, killing all 150 people who were onboard. In the wake of the tragedy, people around the world have turned to search to learn more about the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Germanwings&amp;std=20150324&amp;pn=p1#a=20150324-Germanwings"">crash</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Germanwings&amp;std=20150326&amp;pn=p1#a=20150326-Germanwings"">subsequent investigation</a>. Early searches included questions about Lufthansa, Germanwings’ parent company, and about the type of plane that had crashed; search interest in the Airbus A320 family spiked 100x in the first four hours. But after investigations revealed that co-pilot <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Andreas+Lubitz&amp;std=20150326&amp;pn=p1#a=20150326-Andreas+Lubitz"">Andreas Lubitz</a> appears to have deliberately locked himself in the cockpit and flown the plane into a mountain, the questions got more specific. People asked questions like “How do you access the plane’s cockpit?” and worried: “Is it safe to fly after the Germanwings crash?” and “Is flying becoming more dangerous?” <br />
<br />
<b>Presidential politics</b><br />
Election Day 2016 is more than a year-and-a-half away, but the presidential race is already underway. On Monday, Senator Ted Cruz announced his candidacy. The Texas Republican is known for his fervent opposition to the Affordable Care Act, in particular a 21-hour filibuster-style speech on the floor of the Senate in 2013 (at one point, he read aloud from Dr. Seuss’ <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i>). Searchers turned to the web to answer all kinds of questions about Cruz and his beliefs, sending searches for [cruz liberty], [cruz obamacare] and [cruz wiki] to spike <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=ted%20cruz&amp;date=today%201-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">more than a thousand percent</a> in the last 30 days. The top questions, though, were around whether Cruz is eligible to become President because he was born in Canada. (The answer is yes, BTW.)<br />

This week Zayn Malik confirmed he is leaving boy band One Direction, sending <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelzarrell/teens-mourn-zayn#.wnx7eGyMr"">teens</a> worldwide into a <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/elliewoodward/zayn-malik-has-left-one-direction-and-the-internets-lost-its#.oc42W1rQ3"">tailspin</a> as they asked (and searched): “Why is Zayn leaving One Direction?” The British star said that he is leaving to “be a normal 22-year-old...out of the spotlight,” which may be tough given there were more than <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Zayn+Malik&amp;std=20150325&amp;pn=p1#a=20150325-Zayn+Malik"">a million searches for him</a> on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the rest of the band will go on without him—in fact, search interest in One Direction tours spiked 5x in the U.S. the day of the announcement. <br />
<br />
If freaking out about Zayn isn’t your thing, maybe freaking out about “A” is? The mysterious villain of the ABC Family show <i>Pretty Little Liars</i> was revealed—sorta—on Tuesday night, leading to <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Pretty+Little+Liars&amp;std=20150324&amp;pn=p1#a=20150324-Pretty+Little+Liars"">hundreds of thousands of searches</a>&nbsp;for the show. We won’t spoil it here, even though it was frankly a little hard to miss amidst the outcry. Let’s just say, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=X+Files&amp;std=20150324&amp;pn=p1#a=20150324-X+Files"">the truth is out there</a>. ;)<br />
<br />
Finally, it’s barely spring but it’s already time to start thinking about your summer festival agenda. The line-ups of both San Francisco’s <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Outside+Lands+2015&amp;std=20150324&amp;pn=p1#a=20150324-Outside+Lands+2015"">Outside Lands</a> and Chicago’s <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Lollapalooza+2015&amp;std=20150324&amp;pn=p1#a=20150324-Lollapalooza+2015"">Lollapalooza</a> music festivals were announced this week. The top festival searched in each state breaks down almost exclusively along geographic lines and leaves us wondering: Are Massachusetts residents big <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1789323/outside-lands-2015-lineup/news/"">Elton John</a> fans?<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yMbFyEREhI4/VRXcSg-BvfI/AAAAAAAAP_Y/_c1crXidfpw/s1600/SummerMusicFestival.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yMbFyEREhI4/VRXcSg-BvfI/AAAAAAAAP_Y/_c1crXidfpw/s1600/SummerMusicFestival.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></div><b>Taking charge of your health</b><br />
In a New York Times op-ed, Angelina Jolie revealed that she had undergone surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes to prevent cancer. This was the second preventative surgery for Jolie (she wrote about her double mastectomy in 2013), who made this decision because she carries a mutation in her BRCA1 gene, putting her at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer. There were more than 100,000 searches for <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Angelina+Jolie&amp;std=20150324&amp;pn=p1#a=20150324-Angelina+Jolie"">Angelina Jolie</a> on Tuesday, and people turned to the web to ask related questions about women’s health and cancer prevention.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ytTfWB8Ar7Y/VRXcZjv_N0I/AAAAAAAAP_o/HFyZXzrjyy4/s1600/BRCATesting.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ytTfWB8Ar7Y/VRXcZjv_N0I/AAAAAAAAP_o/HFyZXzrjyy4/s1600/BRCATesting.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></div><b>Tip of the week</b><br />

4646374852472772556,,Google Blogs,2015-03-25T04:00:00-07:00,It's time to put America’s small businesses on the map ,"If you searched for “Dependable Care near Garland, TX” a few months ago, you would have seen a lot of search results—but not the one that mattered to Marieshia Hicks. Marieshia runs <a href=""https://plus.google.com/115560580538070249843/posts"">Dependable Care Health Service</a> in Garland, and it was her business that was missing. But that all changed last month when she attended a workshop at the Garland Chamber of Commerce called Let’s Put Garland on the Map.<br />
<br />
The workshop, run by our Get Your Business Online team, showed her how to use Google My Business—a tool that allows business owners to control the info listed about their business on Google Search and Maps—to help more people find Dependable. Marieshia added an updated phone number, hours of operation, and a description to her business listing. Within a few months, she had more customers come through the door and referrals from doctors who could reach her. This one simple adjustment made a difference. In Marieshia’s words: “It’s huge.” <br />
<br />
Huge might be an understatement. <a href=""https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/research-studies/how-advertisers-can-extend-their-relevance-with-search.html"">Four out of five people</a> use search engines to find local information, like business hours and addresses, and research shows that businesses with complete listings are t<a href=""https://www.gybo.com/downloads/verification-benefits.pdf"">wice as likely</a>&nbsp;(PDF) to be considered reputable by customers. Consumers are <a href=""http://www.gybo.com/search-listing-research"">38 percent more likely to visit and 29 percent more likely to consider purchasing</a> from businesses with complete listings. Yet <a href=""http://www.meclabs.com/training/misc/EXCERPT-PLAIN-BMR-2012-Search-Marketing-SEO-Edition.pdf"">only 37 percent of businesses</a>&nbsp;(PDF) have claimed a local business listing on a search engine. That’s a lot of missed opportunities for small businesses. <br />
<br />
With this in mind, our Get Your Business Online team set out in 2011 to help businesses like Marieshia’s get found online. We’ve gone to every state in the U.S. and worked with thousands of business owners to create free websites and update their Google Search and Maps listings. But there’s a lot more work to do to help businesses take advantage of the vast opportunities yielded by the web. So today, we’re introducing <a href=""http://www.gybo.com/"">Let’s Put Our Cities on the Map</a>, a new program to help 30,000 cities get their local businesses online.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1OFk9EpegUs"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
If we want to help every business in the U.S., we need to reach businesses where they are. So this tailor-made program provides each city with a custom website where local businesses can find helpful resources, including a new diagnostic tool that shows businesses how they appear on Search and Maps, a step-by-step guide for getting online with Google My Business, and a free website and domain name for one year with our partner, Startlogic.<br />
<br />
We’re also forming partnerships with local organizations—like chambers and small business development centers—and equipping them with free trainings and customized city materials to run workshops just like the one Marieshia attended in Garland. These local partners know the challenges for local businesses more than anyone—and they recognize the value of getting businesses online. After all, getting Dependable’s information online not only means the world for Marieshia, it means even more for the city of Garland. Complete business info can help generate economic value <a href=""https://www.gybo.com/downloads/verification-benefits.pdf"">up to $300,000 a year for a small city or up to $7 million for a large one</a>&nbsp;(PDF). So when our local businesses are online, our local economies benefit.<br />
<br />
If you have a favorite local business—a day care, a dentist, a dry cleaner—show your support by helping them get their info online and on the map. Visit your city’s website at <a href=""http://www.gybo.com/"">www.gybo.com</a> to find out how you can get involved.<br />
<br />
Let’s put our cities on the map! <br />

<br />
<b>TV gold</b><br />
FOX’s “<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Empire&amp;std=20150318&amp;pn=p1#a=20150318-Empire"">Empire</a>” has <a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/empire-tv-rise-in-7-charts.html"">built a kingdom of fans</a> during its first season on the air. This week’s finale not only brought the TV show its highest number of viewers—it also had its largest spike in search interest to date with 200,000+ searches Wednesday night. The two-hour finale delivered a king-sized serving of soap opera-esque surprises, ending in a cliffhanger that had fans eager for more (“When does ‘Empire’ season 2 air?” was trending question this week). And “Empire” is making waves in the real-life music industry too: its soundtrack <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6502441/empire-soundtrack-number-one-madonna-number-two"">debuted at number one</a> on Billboard’s Top 200 list this week. Here’s a look at the top searched songs:<br />

Durst was the subject of “The Jinx,” the HBO documentary that aired its final episode Sunday night—in which Durst appears to confess to the crimes. Needless to say, though the police said <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lapd-durst-arrest-hbo-series-20150316-story.html"">the arrest was not connected to the show</a>, the timing was <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=robert%20durst%2C%20the%20jinx&amp;date=today%201-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">great</a> for HBO. Search interest in Robert Durst increased by 1,700 percent in the U.S.<br />
<br />
<b>Spring fever</b><br />
<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=March+Madness&amp;std=20150319&amp;pn=p1#a=20150319-March+Madness"">March Madness</a> tipped off this week, with fans across the nation rushing to fill out their brackets and come up with excuses to be out of the office. Ten of the top 20 searches yesterday were related to college basketball, and people are turning to search to ask important questions like “Who can beat Kentucky?” (They’re undefeated this season.) And everyone wants to know who President Obama is rooting for: his is the <a href=""https://twitter.com/google/status/578619085984043008"">most searched celebrity bracket</a> so far.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VCgN_Ek1O-M/VQyiBgJpBeI/AAAAAAAAP-c/ZL3OjNJu1F0/s1600/RelatedQs_2ndRound.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VCgN_Ek1O-M/VQyiBgJpBeI/AAAAAAAAP-c/ZL3OjNJu1F0/s1600/RelatedQs_2ndRound.jpg"" height=""320"" width=""640"" /></a></div>If your bracket is already busted, you’ve got something else to be happy about: today marks the first day of spring, and the vernal equinox. Even though it’s still cold or even snowy in some spots today, the arrival of spring has people very excited. There were more than 2 million searches for [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Vernal+equinox&amp;std=20150319&amp;pn=p1#a=20150319-Vernal+equinox"">vernal equinox</a>] yesterday—even more than searches for [march madness live]. <br />
<br />
Still, the sun’s position over the Equator isn’t the only celestial event that’s got people searching. On Friday, we’ll see both a Supermoon as well as the only total solar eclipse of the year—the first since 2013. Searches for [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=solar%20eclipse&amp;date=today%201-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">solar eclipse glasses</a>] are up more than 2,000 percent as people figure out how to catch a glimpse. And an intense solar storm brought the aurora borealis south on Tuesday night, making the Northern Lights visible as far south as Oregon and as far out as <a href=""http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/03/18/astronauts-auroras-magnetic-storm-northern-lights-space/"">outer space</a>. The green lights lit up search as well as the skies: search interest went up more than 1,250 percent this week!<br />

Who says it needs to be hot out to eat ice cream? <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Dairy+Queen&amp;std=20150316&amp;pn=p1#a=20150316-Dairy+Queen"">Dairy Queen</a> kicked off its 75th anniversary celebrations on Monday by treating everyone to a free cone, and more than 200,000 searches followed. And it turns out that when it comes to comfort food, ice cream was a better choice this week than the good ol’ blue box. Kraft announced a recall of more than 6 million boxes its classic macaroni and cheese after metal was found in some boxes. There were more than 100,000+ searches for [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Kraft+mac+and+cheese+recall&amp;std=20150318&amp;pn=p1#a=20150318-Kraft+mac+and+cheese+recall"">kraft mac and cheese recall</a>] as people tried to determine whether their pantries were affected. <br />

5755621954015736080,,Google Blogs,2015-03-17T08:30:00-07:00,Bringing street art to your daily life,"For more than 20 years, New Yorkers and street art lovers worldwide made the pilgrimage to 5Pointz, a building in Long Island City called the ""Graffiti Mecca"" because of its brightly colored, ever-changing walls. Artists from around the world covered every inch of the 200,000-square foot exterior with more than 350 technicolor murals. But last summer, this building on Davis Street was whitewashed over by developers, then demolished.<br />
<br />
Street art like that at 5Pointz transforms public spaces into open-air galleries, adding vibrancy to urban landscapes. But using the city as a canvas often means these artworks are here today, gone tomorrow. With the Google Art Project, we’re working to preserve this ephemeral art form and make it available to fans around the world, anywhere and anytime. <br />
<br />
Last June, <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.fr/2014/06/the-world-is-canvas-introducing-street.html"">we added</a> street art from all over the globe—<a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/5-pointz-nyc/wRU6hVET?projectId=street-art"">including 5Pointz</a>—to the Google Art Project. Today, we’re <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/browse/?projectId=street-art"">doubling</a> the number of public artworks to more than 10,000 high-resolution images. Eighty-five art organizations from 34 countries are sharing pieces, ranging from Sweden’s most famous <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/artscape-2014-virtual-tour/uAIC23FNeKp5JA?projectId=street-art"">street festival</a>, to <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/the-water-tank-project-a-virtual-walking-tour/nQKC-nah34U6Iw?projectId=street-art"">water tanks wrapped with art</a> among New York city’s rooftops, to the abandoned walls of <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/the-talking-walls-of-buenos-aires-la-boca/mAICdXF-PN3rJA?projectId=street-art"">Buenos Aires</a> that are a source of inspiration for street artists from all over the world.<br />

This string of numbers separated by periods—an IP address—isn’t nearly as easy or memorable as typing google.com. Domain names ending in things like .COM, .NET and .EDU make browsing the web and telling people where to find you online easier. Since this month marks the 30-year anniversary of .COM and several other domain endings, we’re taking a minute to celebrate these often-overlooked suffixes that have changed the way we use the web.<br />

Using these online addresses, people began to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/10/us/candidates-for-president-turn-to-the-web.html"">spread messages</a>, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/02/business/companies-rush-to-set-up-shop-in-cyberspace.html"">start businesses</a> and <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/30/technology/state-of-the-art-searching-for-less-not-more.html"">access information</a> that otherwise would have been nearly impossible to find.

<br />
<b>Preachin' papas</b><br />
“Dude, where’s my baby changing table?” That’s what actor Ashton Kutcher was wondering on <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/11/living/feat-ashton-kutcher-changing-table/"">social media</a> after he observed a lack of diaper-changing facilities in men’s restrooms. Kutcher offered to give a shout-out on his Facebook page to the the first business he could find with diaper-friendly bathrooms. While the actor’s call to arms might not move the needle in terms of shifting societal perceptions on parenting, it did get the celebrity <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Ashton%20Kutcher&amp;date=today%207-d&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">trending</a> on the search charts. <br />
<br />
<b>Runways and sun tans</b><br />
Peering into our search crystal ball, we think we see a little more breakdance fighting in our future. This past Tuesday, actors Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson surprised fans and fashionistas everywhere when they unexpectedly <a href=""http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/03/10/zoolander-2-valentino-show-paris-fashion-week-ben-stiller-owen-wilson-modeling/"">took to the catwalk</a> during Valentino's display for Paris Fashion Week—all just to announce <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Zoolander+2&amp;std=20150310&amp;pn=p1#a=20150310-Zoolander+2"">the sequel</a> to their cult classic Zoolander. The news cracked the top 10 on trends for that day as searchers looked for videos of Stiller and Wilson strutting their stuff in full Zoolander and Hansel persona. One thing is clear: Blue steel is back in season. <br />

You know who else is excited right now? College kids, thanks to a little annual tradition called spring break. Students are all packed up and ready to hit the sun-drenched beaches of Panama City and South Padre Island, and searches for last-minute destinations and travel suggestions are heating up. <br />
<br />
<b>Boiling over</b><br />
<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Ferguson&amp;std=20150312&amp;pn=p1#a=20150312-Ferguson"">Ferguson</a>, Mo., is in the headlines again, and the reasons aren’t getting any better. First, the city’s police chief resigned following an investigation into his department that found evidence of racism. Then, two police officers were shot and injured during a demonstration at the Ferguson Police Department. Both officers are out of the hospital, but no arrests have been made, and <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/security-change-ferguson-after-2-police-officers-are-shot-n322491"">protests</a> are erupting in a city still traumatized by recent events—stirring people to get on the web to find the latest updates and causing <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Ferguson&amp;date=today%207-d&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">sustained interest</a> in the small city.  <br />
<br />
<b>Imitation is the sincerest form of payment</b><br />
Musicians Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were found guilty of plagiarism after a jury determined that the duo infringed on soul singer Marvin Gaye’s track “Got to Give it Up” in 2013’s summer jam “<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Blurred+Lines&amp;std=20150310&amp;pn=p1#a=20150310-Blurred+Lines"">Blurred Lines</a>.” The artists were hit with a whopping $7.4 million fine and generated 200,000+ searches. Some are already deriding the decision as a vote against <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-blurred-lines-verdict-reaction-20150310-column.html"">creative expression</a> and a terrible precedent to set for the music industry.

Today, on the web’s birthday, we’re highlighting recent improvements to Safe Browsing, technology that protects more than 1.1 billion people all over the world.</i> -Ed.<br />
<br />
As the web continues to evolve, it’s important that user protections develop in lockstep so that people stay safe online. Our Safe Browsing technology may not be <i>quite</i> as old as the web—which celebrates its <a href=""http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2014/03/world-wide-web-born-cern-25-years-ago"">26th birthday</a> today—but ever since Safe Browsing <a href=""http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2007/05/introducing-googles-anti-malware.html"">launched</a> nearly eight years ago, it’s continually adapted to protect web users, everywhere.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qiB48NcYjnU/VQGwBKAJElI/AAAAAAAAP60/W0dwW8W-cNM/s1600/CK_Google_Cake_Blog.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qiB48NcYjnU/VQGwBKAJElI/AAAAAAAAP60/W0dwW8W-cNM/s1600/CK_Google_Cake_Blog.gif"" height=""180"" width=""320"" /></a></div>Safe Browsing gives users—both on Google and across on the web—information they need to steer clear of danger. The dangerous sites detected by Safe Browsing generally fall into two categories: sites that attack users <i>intentionally</i> with either <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware"">malware</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing"">phishing</a>, or <a href=""https://www.google.com/about/company/unwanted-software-policy.html"">unwanted software</a> that is deceptive or hard to uninstall, or sites that attack users <i>unintentionally</i> because they have been compromised, often without the site’s owner realizing this has happened.<br />
<br />
Once we detect these sites, Safe Browsing warns people about them in a variety of ways.  You’ve probably come across a warning like this in Chrome, Firefox or Safari; it’s powered by Safe Browsing:<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l0vRG2VpYYI/VQGwHLFzbDI/AAAAAAAAP7E/H0mdBnKzjrU/s1600/png%3Bbase6454b054f31de5fa53.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l0vRG2VpYYI/VQGwHLFzbDI/AAAAAAAAP7E/H0mdBnKzjrU/s1600/png%3Bbase6454b054f31de5fa53.png"" height=""283"" width=""400"" /></a></div>Today, Safe Browsing shows people more than 5 million warnings per day for all sorts of malicious sites and unwanted software, and discovers more than 50,000 malware sites and more than 90,000 phishing sites every month. If you’re interested, you can see information about the dangerous sites that are detected by this technology anytime in our <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/safebrowsing/"">Safe Browsing Transparency Report</a>.<br />
<br />
We also use Safe Browsing technology to warn website owners or operators about issues with their sites so they can quickly fix them. We provide basic site maintenance tips, as well as specific Safe Browsing notifications in Webmaster Tools and Google Analytics. Often site owners don’t realize there are issues with their sites until they get these notifications.<br />
<br />
<b>Recent developments</b><br />
Since its earliest days, Safe Browsing has been widely available, and free—for users, site owners, and other companies—to use and integrate into their own products.  In the early days, we focused on detecting dangerous sites and then showing people warnings:<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lLUskTDmlgo/VQGwEA-oOQI/AAAAAAAAP68/acc7jPKcD1w/s1600/old%2Bsafe%2Bbrowsing%2Bwarning.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lLUskTDmlgo/VQGwEA-oOQI/AAAAAAAAP68/acc7jPKcD1w/s1600/old%2Bsafe%2Bbrowsing%2Bwarning.png"" height=""278"" width=""400"" /></a></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i>An early Safe Browsing notification, c. 2007. These would appear in the top right corner of people’s web browsers when they visited a site that had been flagged by Safe Browsing as potentially dangerous.</i></div><br />
But, just as attacks become more sophisticated, we’ve made sure our own technologies have kept up. Over the years, we’ve built Safe Browsing into other Google products to help protect people in more places:<br />
<br />
<ul><li><b>Safe Browsing API:</b> We already make Safe Browsing data available for free to developers. This week we’re adding information about sites that host unwanted software, allowing developers to better protect their users as well.</li>
<li><b>Chrome: </b>Before people <a href=""http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/02/more-protection-from-unwanted-software.html"">visit</a> a site delivering <a href=""https://www.google.com/about/company/unwanted-software-policy.html"">unwanted software</a>, or try to <a href=""http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/08/thats-not-download-youre-looking-for.html"">download</a> some of it, we show them a clear warning.</li>
<li><b>Google Analytics:</b> We recently <a href=""http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/02/safe-browsing-and-google-analytics.html"">integrated</a> Safe Browsing notifications into Google Analytics, so site owners can quickly take action to protect their users if there are issues with their websites. Previously, we’d only provided these warnings via our Webmaster Tools service.</li>
<li><b>Ads:</b> We’ve also <a href=""https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/6101154?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=29265"">recently</a> begun to identify ads that target people with unwanted software.</li>
</ul><br />
As the web grows up, Safe Browsing technology will, too. We’re looking forward to protecting the web, and its users, for many birthdays to come.<br />

7453620141376204977,,Google Blogs,2015-03-11T11:00:00-07:00,Meet the updated Chromebook Pixel and the new Google Store,"Two years ago, we <a href=""http://chrome.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-chromebook-pixel-for-whats-next.html"">introduced</a> the first Chromebook Pixel. The idea was to bring together the best in hardware, software and design to inspire the next generation of Chromebooks. It's been exciting to see how the entire range of Chromebooks—from classroom-proof to high-end—has made a difference to people <a href=""http://www.futuresource-consulting.com/2014-12-record-quarter-for-chromebooks-press-3428.html"">at school</a>, <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/2863936/amazons-three-top-selling-computers-for-the-holidays-were-chromebooks.html"">at home</a>, and <a href=""http://googleforwork.blogspot.com/2014/10/chromebooks-for-work-more-manageable.html"">at work</a>. Today, we’re introducing <a href=""http://www.google.com/chromebook/pixel"">an updated and more powerful Pixel</a> to fuel the imaginations of another wave of Chromebook enthusiasts. Plus, we’ve created a new, online <a href=""https://store.google.com/?utm_source=blogpost&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=launch"">Google Store</a> where you can get the Pixel and other devices made with Google, all in one place.  <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/jC8Xy3Q82hY"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
<b>One charger for all your stuff</b><br />
These days, packing for a trip means remembering to bring all your different chargers—for your phone, laptop, tablet, watch, etc. We think you should be able to use just one charger for all your electronics. So for the new Pixel, we’ve joined forces with some of the biggest names in the industry to create a new standard for charging, called <a href=""http://www.usb.org/press/USB-IF_Press_Releases/Type-C_PR_20131203_Final.pdf"">USB Type C</a>. The Pixel is one of the first products to launch with this new standard, with more Chromebooks and Android devices following suit soon.<br />
<br />
Not only does Type-C enable multi-device charging, but it also allows high-speed data and display over the same connector and cable. It’s small enough to work with smartphones, powerful enough to charge computers, and conveniently symmetrical (no more guessing which side is up!). Speaking of symmetry, the new Pixel doesn’t just have one Type C port—it has two, one on each side, so you can plug in wherever is convenient. <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-J0FWWDuRg"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
<b>Thoughtful design</b><br />
Like the original Pixel, the new Chromebook has a high-resolution touchscreen, a sleek aluminum body, and smooth glass trackpad. We’ve also made a few other enhancements, including a new wide-angle camera lens. <br />
<br />
Of course, the Pixel is also great on the inside. It’s got a powerful Intel® Core™ i5 with 8GB RAM and a 32GB SSD. If that’s not enough for you, we’re making an LS (yup, that stands for ""Ludicrous Speed"") version that's even faster. And even with the new charger, you probably won’t be carrying it around much, since the new Pixel has 12 hours of battery life.* When you do need to top up, it’s fast—you’ll get up to two hours of battery life with just 15 minutes of charging.*<br />
<br />
<b>Shop for the Pixel and more at the Google Store </b><br />
We’ve been selling our devices on Google Play for years, but as we’ve added more products to the family, we thought it was time to make it easier for you to learn more about them. So today we’re also launching the Google Store, the new home for the latest devices made with Google.<br />
<br />
At <a href=""https://store.google.com/?utm_source=blogpost&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=launch"">store.google.com</a>, you can shop Nexus phones and tablets, Chromecast and Chromebooks, learn more about newer technology like Android Wear, Nexus Player and Nest, and stock up on accessories like cases, keyboards and chargers. You’ll see how the Google apps you already know—like Search, Maps and YouTube—work seamlessly with all these products. The Google Store is available on your phone, tablet, or laptop, and right now you’ll get free shipping on everything** (consider it our way of saying hello).<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zBLSBIhUZSY/VQCV-H3hHKI/AAAAAAAAP6c/BA8xUL7idng/s1600/gTL2OJ3gkb.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zBLSBIhUZSY/VQCV-H3hHKI/AAAAAAAAP6c/BA8xUL7idng/s1600/gTL2OJ3gkb.png"" height=""326"" width=""640"" /></a></div>Once you’ve found the right device at the Google Store, you can still head to Google Play to find apps, games, music, movies, TV shows and more. If you recently bought a device on Google Play, don’t worry—your order info will automatically be transferred to the Google Store. <a href=""https://support.google.com/store"">See our Help Center</a> for more information.<br />
<br />
The Chromebook Pixel is available for purchase starting today in the U.S. on the new Google Store for $999 and $1299 for the LS version. Come <a href=""https://store.google.com/product/chromebook_pixel_2015?utm_source=blogpost&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_content=chromebook_pixel&amp;utm_campaign=launch"">check it out</a>, and see what else is in <a href=""https://store.google.com/?utm_source=blogpost&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=launch"">store</a>.<br />

5333492032358185238,,Google Blogs,2015-03-07T21:00:00-08:00,Connect. Create. Celebrate women in technology.,"Ask Liz Liao what accomplishment she’s most proud of, and she’ll tell you it’s not her master’s degree in robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, her numerous published articles, or even the autonomous industrial robot she helped develop as a senior software engineer at Seegrid. Nope—according to Liz, her greatest achievement is co-founding <a href=""https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/minneapolis"">Girl Develop It Minneapolis</a>, a chapter in the national non-profit <a href=""https://www.girldevelopit.com/about"">Girl Develop It</a>, which provides hands-on programs and a network of support to women interested in learning web and software development.<br />

Liz often remembers being the only woman engineer on her team, but it wasn’t until she moved to a new city and spent more time working remotely that she began to feel isolated—and realized how important it was for her to have a community of like-minded people to connect with. She started volunteering with a few local organizations and started the local Girl Develop It chapter in 2014. In just seven months, her chapter has more than 500 members and Liz has found a network of people she can connect to.<br />
<br />
There are many women like Liz who never find that sense of community and instead end up leaving tech permanently. Not only does that mean our industry is less diverse than it should be, but it also leads to less innovative products. That’s why it’s so important for Google to do our part in creating environments, programs and policies that help women in technology thrive. We’ve partnered with organizations like <a href=""https://www.girldevelopit.com/"">Girl Develop It</a>, <a href=""https://www.womenwhocode.com/"">Women Who Code</a>, <a href=""http://anitaborg.org/"">Anita Borg Institute</a> and the <a href=""http://www.ncwit.org/"">National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology</a> to create a more supportive environment for women in tech. And this International Women’s Day, we’re building on our efforts to empower women to become makers of technology. Here’s a look at what we’re up to:<br />
<br />
<b>Women Techmakers</b><br />
Last year, Google started our Women Techmakers program to provide visibility, resources and a community for women in technology worldwide. This month we kicked off our second annual <a href=""http://womentechmakers.com/"">Women Techmakers Global Event Series</a>, and we encourage you to attend an event to meet incredible women from around the world who are leading the technology industry. Create the future of wearables at a summit or from home with a brand new <a href=""http://g.co/dev/codelab-watchface"">Android Wear Watch Face Codelab</a>, and engage with the community using our hashtag #WTM15. For event highlights, photos and more check out Women Techmakers on <a href=""https://twitter.com/womentechmakers"">Twitter</a> and <a href=""http://youtube.com/WomenTechmakers"">YouTube</a>.<br />

<b>Share your wisdom with a #DearMe video letter</b><br />
For many young girls, the path to finding themselves is filled with uncertainty. It’s hard to figure out what you want to do or who you want to be when you’re dealing with gossip, self-doubt and pressure from all sides. As part of our International Women’s Day celebration, we’re encouraging you to think back on the advice you wish you’d gotten when you were a young, and to share those words of wisdom with today’s teenage girls. Submit a video letter on YouTube tagged with #DearMe telling your younger self what you wish someone had told you. We’re looking forward to what you have to say.<br />

<b>A Doodle honoring women who transform the world </b><br />
Finally, we couldn’t let International Women’s Day pass without a Doodle. So our homepage today celebrates the many ways women scientists, engineers, athletes, doctors, artists, explorers and more are changing the world. <br />

<br />
<b>Yes, you did just see that</b><br />
What’s furry, has wings and hits the trends charts with 50,000+ searches? A <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Weasel+Woodpecker&amp;std=20150303&amp;pn=p1#a=20150303-Weasel+Woodpecker"">weasel woodpecker</a>...or more accurately a weasel riding a woodpecker. Nature’s most unlikely pair was a top search on Monday after amateur photographer Martin Le-May snapped an incredible <a href=""https://twitter.com/Jayward7/status/572495249756577792"">photo</a> which went viral. Like most online phenomena, this one has its dissenters: many are speculating that the photo is a <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/03/150303-weasels-woodpeckers-animals-science-weaselpecker-photos/"">fake</a>.<br />
<br />
That wasn’t this week’s only unusual sight. Actor <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Jared+Leto&amp;std=20150302&amp;pn=p1#a=20150302-Jared+Leto"">Jared Leto</a> stepped out without his trademark <a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/03/jared-leto-haircut"">flowing locks</a>, instead sporting <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/05/jared-leto-blond_n_6808636.html"">platinum blond</a> short hair for his role in the new movie Suicide Squad.

<b>Email: more trouble than it’s worth?</b><br />
There was a <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F0d06m5&amp;date=today%207-d&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">spike</a> in searches for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after news broke that she used her private email rather than an official government account while she was in office. The potential Democratic presidential candidate’s actions are drawing criticism from the media, although Republicans have remained <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/hillary-clinton-email-flap-creates-awkward-gop-silence-115781.html"">surprisingly silent</a> on the issue. To quell fears that she’s got something to hide, Clinton tweeted: “<a href=""https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/573340998287413248"">I want the public to see my email</a>”—guess there aren’t any skeletons in this inbox. <br />
<br />
<b>Trolls exit here</b><br />
Karma, meet Internet trolls. This week several prominent figures struck back at their online harassers, starting with baseball player <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Curt+Schilling&amp;std=20150302&amp;pn=p1#a=20150302-Curt+Schilling"">Curt Schilling</a>, who called out on his personal blog cyber bullies who had made offensive comments about his daughter on Twitter. Two of the commenters have already lost their <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/curt-schilling-takes-action-against-daughters-online-bullies/"">jobs</a> due to Schilling’s response, leading some people to dub him an “<a href=""http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/12418373/curt-schilling-unlikely-internet-vigilante"">Internet Vigilante</a>.” The situation has certainly raised Shilling’s profile: Searches for the former Red Sox player have hit their <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F01k1rx&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">highest</a> in years. <br />
<br />
American Idol winner <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Kelly+Clarkson&amp;std=20150302&amp;pn=p1#a=20150302-Kelly+Clarkson"">Kelly Clarkson</a> was next to take a swing at the haters. When British TV personality Katie Hopkins tweeted multiple derogatory remarks about Clarkson’s weight, the singer stood up for herself and against body shaming. Clarkson responded saying, “<a href=""http://www.refinery29.com/2015/03/83324/kelly-clarkson-katie-hopkins-fat-shame-troll"">I’m awesome</a>,” and that she doesn’t seek acceptance from others. The social media universe gave the singer a collective “You go girl,” and pushed Clarkson to the top of the search charts.<br />

<br />
<b>Internet gold </b><br />
Is it white and gold? Or blue and black? That’s the question that had everyone searching, tweeting and generally freaking out Thursday after a Tumblr user posted a photo of a dress that seemed to appear different colors to different people. Debate over the true color of the dress raged for hours, while others tried to <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/02/science-one-agrees-color-dress/"">solve the mystery</a> of its divisiveness.

But as we’ve inhabited a variety of workplaces—including a garage in Menlo Park, a farmhouse in Denmark and an entire New York city block—we’ve learned something about what makes an office space great. And we’re excited to put that into practice, starting here at our home in Mountain View.  <br />
<br />
Today we’re submitting a plan to redevelop four sites—places where we already have offices but hope to significantly increase our square footage—to the Mountain View City Council. It's the first time we'll design and build offices from scratch and we hope these plans by Bjarke Ingels at <a href=""http://www.big.dk/#projects"">BIG</a> and <a href=""http://www.heatherwick.com/"">Thomas Heatherwick</a> at Heatherwick Studio will lead to a better way of working.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q1cBq73Xfd4/VPCevVPO3lI/AAAAAAAAP1I/kzQr9sIqr8o/s1600/Charleston-South_Exterior_Softgrid.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q1cBq73Xfd4/VPCevVPO3lI/AAAAAAAAP1I/kzQr9sIqr8o/s1600/Charleston-South_Exterior_Softgrid.jpg"" height=""314"" width=""640"" /></a></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i>A rendering of our proposed new campus. <a href=""https://plus.google.com/b/116899029375914044550/photos/+google/albums/6120564551779148881"">See more images on Google+</a></i></div><br />
The idea is simple. Instead of constructing immoveable concrete buildings, we’ll create lightweight block-like structures which can be moved around easily as we invest in new product areas. (Our self-driving car team, for example, has very different needs when it comes to office space from our Search engineers.) Large translucent canopies will cover each site, controlling the climate inside yet letting in light and air. With trees, landscaping, cafes, and bike paths weaving through these structures, we aim to blur the distinction between our buildings and nature.<br />
<br />
Of course, this project is about much more than just office space; it’s about doing more with the local community as well. So we’re adding lots of bike paths and retail opportunities, like restaurants, for local businesses. We also hope to bring new life to the unique local environment, from enhancing burrowing owl habitats to widening creek beds. And we’re committed to do everything we can to save energy—our recent agreement to <a href=""//googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/02/from-altamont-pass-to-mountain-view.html"">offset our energy consumption in North Bayshore with renewable energy</a> includes the development of this proposal.  <br />
<br />
We chose Mountain View for our headquarters 15 years ago because we love the beauty of the bay, the close proximity to great universities, the family-friendly environment and the chance to work in a city at the heart of Silicon Valley. Today, we want to create office spaces that don’t just provide a great home for Google, but which also work for the city that has given us so much.  <br />
<br />
We look forward to working with our neighbors at the City Council on this proposal—and the future of Mountain View’s North Bayshore.<br />

Every year around this time, we see an uptick in searches for spring and summer travel from people who have had it up to here with winter. And in the middle of one of the coldest, snowiest, iciest winters on record in the U.S., you better believe people are gearing up to grab their suntan lotion and their carry-ons, and hop on a plane. Enter <a href=""https://www.google.com/flights/"">Google Flights</a>, which makes it easy to plan the trip that’s right for you. Here are a few tips to help you book this year’s dream vacation.<br />
<br />
<b>Flexibility is key when finding great deals</b><br />
There’s a travel myth that you can always find the best deals on Tuesday. But actually, you can find good deals any day of the week—especially if you’re flexible with your travel dates. Though it’s sometimes hard to pull the trigger because you’re afraid the price will drop tomorrow (or next Tuesday, maybe?), our experience shows it’s usually best to book right away. <br />
<br />
Regardless of which day you sit down to plan your trip, you can use the <a href=""http://googletravel.blogspot.com/2014/02/calendar-shopping-for-flights-just-got.html"">calendar</a> in Google Flights to scroll through months and see the lowest fare highlighted for each day. If you’re planning even further out, use the lowest fares graph beneath the calendar to see how prices may fluctuate based on the season, holidays or other events. You can also set preferences (such as direct flights only) and our calendar will adjust to show you just those flights and fares that fit the bill. Finally, if you can save more by using a nearby airport or flying on a different day, we’ll show you a tip at the top of your results. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sr1bbItkmp4/VO0xUOob9jI/AAAAAAAAP0U/JAe0IBCBTT0/s1600/OGB%2BFlights%2BPress%2BBreakfast%2Bcal%2Blow%2Bfare%2Bgraph%2Bimage.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sr1bbItkmp4/VO0xUOob9jI/AAAAAAAAP0U/JAe0IBCBTT0/s1600/OGB%2BFlights%2BPress%2BBreakfast%2Bcal%2Blow%2Bfare%2Bgraph%2Bimage.png"" height=""381"" width=""400"" /></a></div><b>Not sure about your destination? No problem</b><br />
Sometimes, you know exactly where your destination needs to be—say, when you’re taking a business trip, or headed to a wedding or family reunion. But there are times when all you know is that you want to go somewhere. Maybe you want to go somewhere with a beach, but don’t care if it’s in Greece or the Caribbean. Or you want to visit Southeast Asia, but aren’t sure which countries to visit. <br />
<a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B0bjsPCTJ_0/VO0wfIpCR3I/AAAAAAAAP0I/nFG0d6cf0Sk/s1600/ogb-gfs-regional-dreaming-600px.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B0bjsPCTJ_0/VO0wfIpCR3I/AAAAAAAAP0I/nFG0d6cf0Sk/s1600/ogb-gfs-regional-dreaming-600px.png"" /></a><br />
Our research shows <a href=""http://storage.googleapis.com/think/docs/2014-travelers-road-to-decision_research_studies.pdf"">more than half of searchers</a> don’t know where they’re going to travel when they sit down to plan. With Google Flights, you can search for regions or whole countries, like “<a href=""https://www.google.com/flights/#search;f=EWR,JFK,LGA;t=r-Europe-0x46ed8886cfadda85%253A0x72ef99e6b3fcf079;d=2015-03-12;r=2015-03-16;mc=m;q=flights+to+europe"">Flights to Europe</a>” and “<a href=""https://www.google.com/flights/#search;f=EWR,JFK,LGA;t=r-Mexico-0x84043a3b88685353%253A0xed64b4be6b099811;d=2015-03-12;r=2015-03-16;mc=m;q=flights+to+europe"">Flights to Mexico</a>."" Or, expand the map to scan the entire world and see accurate prices for all the different cities you can fly to, along with filters for your flight preferences. If you’re in a particularly adventurous—or lazy—mood, select the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button on the map and we’ll suggest ideas for where to go based on popular destinations and your past search history.<br />
<br />
<b>But… cheaper isn’t always better</b><br />
We all love a good deal, but when it comes to choosing flights, cheaper doesn’t always win—and no wonder, when sometimes that means two connections instead of none. On Google Flights, the vast majority of people choose one of the <a href=""http://googletravel.blogspot.com/2013/07/flight-search-now-even-easier-to-use.html"">Best flights</a>—considered to be flights that are the best combination of price and convenience. Try it out next time you’re looking for something that fits your schedule, not just your budget. <br />
<a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ec9kcWm9Lt0/VO0we-Nk2pI/AAAAAAAAP0E/YKTg_nVQ1mQ/s1600/ogb-gfs-cheapest-flight-600px.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ec9kcWm9Lt0/VO0we-Nk2pI/AAAAAAAAP0E/YKTg_nVQ1mQ/s1600/ogb-gfs-cheapest-flight-600px.png"" /></a><br />
So once you’ve warmed your hands on that cup of hot cocoa, put them to work on your keyboard or phone. Google Flights is ready to find the best destinations, dates, fares and flights for you to get away from it all.<br />

It’s also designed to tap into students’ existing interests, showing them how CS can integrate with the rest of their lives. Inspired by fashion, art, music, politics and more, students have used code to build videos, games and stories on topics big and small, from how they met their best friends to solving global hunger.<br />

Now, we’re partnering with <a href=""http://goo.gl/j9Bk66"">Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America</a> and <a href=""http://goo.gl/8cioDK"">Corporation for National and Community Service</a> to bring CS First to even more students across the country. A new group of 20 AmeriCorps VISTA members will spend a year helping local Boys &amp; Girls Clubs incorporate CS First and other educational programs into their slate of activities, giving more young people, especially those who might not otherwise be exposed to coding, greater access to computer science education. <br />
<br />
Computer science is increasingly important to building a successful career, in fields varying from medicine to architecture to music. But today, there aren’t enough computer scientists to fill the available jobs—and on top of that, many populations aren’t equally represented in the field. According to code.org, only 8 percent of people who take the Advanced Placement Computer Science Exam are students of color, and only 15 percent are women. And while women earn 57 percent of all bachelor's degrees, only 12 percent of computer science degrees are awarded to women. We want to expand the pool of technologists, and make sure that all young people, regardless of background or resources, have access to high-quality CS education from an early age. <br />
<br />
That’s what this new effort is all about. Our partners have long been committed to supporting young people and communities. <a href=""http://goo.gl/j9Bk66"">Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America</a> gives young people access to opportunities to help them become productive and responsible citizens during out of school time. And <a href=""http://goo.gl/TwY1xk"">AmeriCorps VISTA</a> taps the skills and passion of more than 7,000 Americans annually to support community efforts to overcome poverty. Working together, we can empower more young people with the technical know-how they need to succeed in today’s society and economy. <br />
<br />
Join us in making CS more accessible to more kids, and <a href=""http://goo.gl/pBj84s"">apply on the AmeriCorps website</a> by March 1. If accepted, you’ll come to the Google headquarters in Mountain View for training before spending a year in one of six cities. Best of all, your year of service will make a real difference in the lives of young people. <br />

When we wanted to watch cartoons, we eagerly awaited Saturday morning. Today’s kids have it even better—they have all of these options, plus a world of knowledge and information at their fingertips via the Internet. That opens up wonderful opportunities, but also can cause some worry for those of us who are parents.<br />
<br />
So <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/12/03/google-products-revamped-for-under-13-crowd/19803447/"">over the past year</a>, teams across Google—including many passionate parents—have been looking at how families are using our products, and how we can make it easier for children and parents to explore and play together. We decided to start with YouTube. <br />
<br />
For years, families have come to YouTube, watching countless hours of videos on a variety of topics. And today, we’re launching YouTube Kids, a new family-friendly app that makes it easy for kids to explore a vast selection of videos on any topic. <br />
<br />
In the new YouTube Kids app, available on Android and iOS in the U.S., videos are narrowed to focus on content that is appropriate for the whole family. You might explore DIY arts and crafts, learn how to find the circumference of a circle, or watch favorites from Mother Goose Club to Minecraft, as well as new series from National Geographic Kids and Reading Rainbow. And there are more train videos than even you can count. <br />
<br />
We’ve designed the app to be easier for kids to use, with a brighter and bigger interface that’s perfect for small thumbs and pudgy fingers. For parents, we’ve built in options that let you decide how your family uses the app, including the ability to set viewing limits with a timer.<br />

Read on to learn the details.<br />

What better way to start your morning than with seven feet of snow? That’s what the lucky people of New England are saying (or not saying) as they endure the wrath of the aptly named <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Thundersnow&amp;std=20150216&amp;pn=p1#a=20150216-Thundersnow"">Thundersnow</a>. This type of storm occurs when a thunderstorm features snow instead of rain, and is just the latest storm in a record-breaking month of winter weather. The phenomena led to 20,000+ searches, which might have at least a little to do with The Weather Channel’s Jim Cantore’s on-air <a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/weather/2015/02/16/jim-cantore-why-loves-thundersnow/OoVMhvW5HhmxtrFAwYqdHN/story.html"">celebration</a> when the storm hit.

But the highlight of the event is the Best Picture Category, which many consider to be a tight race this year. The favorites are <i>Boyhood</i> and <i>Birdman</i>, but if searches this past month determined the winner, it would be Wes Anderson's <i>The Grand Budapest Hotel</i>.<br />
<br />

<br />
<b>Artists in the spotlight</b><br />
Around The Grammy’s last week, two artists were at the front of the search pack: <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Beck&amp;std=20150208&amp;pn=p1#a=20150208-Beck"">Beck</a>, who took home the Album of the Year award, and <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Kanye+West&amp;std=20150208&amp;pn=p1#a=20150208-Kanye+West"">Kanye West</a>. Kanye almost pulled a Kanye (of 2009 VMA’s fame) when he appeared on the verge of interrupting Beck’s acceptance speech; West was upset that Beck won the award over Beyonce, who (according to West) had the best album of all time. <br />
<br />
Other top artists in search include <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Sia&amp;std=20150208&amp;pn=p1#a=20150208-Sia"">Sia</a>—along with <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Kristen+Wiig+Grammys&amp;std=20150209&amp;pn=p1#a=20150209-Kristen+Wiig+Grammys"">Kristen Wiig</a>, who appeared in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rFkpcyZ598"">Sia’s Grammy performance</a>, although Sia’s face did not—and <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Annie+Lennox&amp;std=20150208&amp;pn=p1#a=20150208-Annie+Lennox"">Annie Lennox</a>, who’s still got it. Finally, searchers were struck by a sober moment during the ceremony: after domestic abuse survivor Brooke Axtell shared her personal story on stage, <a href=""https://twitter.com/google/status/564902316525228033"">search interest in [domestic violence] spiked 93x</a>.<br />

Meanwhile, Jon Stewart announced he will leave <i>The Daily Show</i> after 16 years, devastating loyal fans everywhere and inspiring speculation over who will replace him. And finally, we said goodbye to two legends of journalism: <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Bob+Simon&amp;std=20150211&amp;pn=p1#a=20150211-Bob+Simon"">Bob Simon</a>, CBS News reporter and <i>60 Minutes</i> correspondent for decades, and <i>The New York Times</i>’ media columnist <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=David+Carr&amp;std=20150212&amp;pn=p1#a=20150212-David+Carr"">David Carr</a>&nbsp;are being mourned by colleagues and readers.<br />

More than 50,000 searches followed as people tried to get a glimpse before they were taken down. And speaking of lucky, this week’s $500+ million Powerball jackpot had people searching like crazy in hopes of winning the big bucks.

For example, making use of <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/efficiency/datacenters/"">natural climates</a> has helped us make our data centers 50% more efficient than the industry average, and green building technology has helped us limit energy consumption in our offices around the world. Now, we’re doing more with less to power Google’s North Bayshore campus in Mountain View.<br />
<br />
We’ve recently signed a long-term agreement to purchase enough local wind energy to offset the electrical consumption of our North Bayshore headquarters on an annual basis. While we’ve been committed to being a carbon-neutral company <a href=""//googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/06/carbon-neutrality-by-end-of-2007.html"">since 2007</a>, and we purchase clean energy for our <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/energy/use/#purchasing"">data centers</a>, this agreement is the first of its kind when it comes to our offices.<br />
<br />
The agreement with <a href=""http://www.nexteraenergyresources.com/home/index.shtml"">NextEra Energy Resources</a> will help to repower an iconic Bay Area wind farm at California’s Altamont Pass with new turbines that will pour 43 MW of electricity onto the grid starting in 2016.

While these electrons can’t be traced once they enter the grid, we can measure how many of them leave the turbines, as well as how many we use on campus on an annual basis (tracked through a system of <a href=""http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/us/green/pdfs/renewable-energy.pdf"">renewable energy credits</a>, or RECs). So even though the electrons follow an untraceable path through the California electricity grid, we can be sure that we're offsetting the electrical consumption of our North Bayshore headquarters with the renewable energy from the new turbines.<br />
<br />
Since our first wind investment <a href=""//googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/not-merely-tilting-at-windmills.html"">in 2010</a>, we’ve developed close relationships with renewable energy providers, helping us secure renewable energy agreements like this one for our campus and data centers—<a href=""http://www.google.com/green/energy/use/#purchasing"">more than 1.1 gigawatt’s worth</a> to date—and it’s also made it possible for us to make equity investments in <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/energy/#investments"">17 utility-scale renewable energy projects</a>. And over the years we’ve been thrilled to see other California leaders, from <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-will-invest-850m-in-california-solar-farm/"">tech companies</a> to <a href=""http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-make-large-purchase-solar-energy-partner-frontier-renewables"">universities</a>, also working to bring more renewable energy online.<br />
<br />
Finally, if we can geek out for a minute: We think this project is especially cool because back in the 1980’s, the golden hills of Altamont Pass were an early test bed for the first large-scale wind power technology in the U.S. We’ve been blown away (pun intended :)) by how far turbine technology has come since then. Once the installation is complete, and the 370 legacy turbines are replaced, it will take just 24 new ones to generate as much power as our campus uses in a year. Talk about doing more with less.<br />

Maybe you heard a news story about gluten-free diets and pulled up <a href=""http://g.co/googleapp"">the Google app</a> to ask, ""What is celiac disease?"" Maybe a co-worker shook your hand and later found out she had pink eye, so you looked up “pink eye” to see whether it’s contagious. Or maybe you were worried about a loved one—like I was, recently, when my infant son Veer fell off a bed in a hotel in rural Vermont, and I was concerned that he might have a concussion. I wasn’t able to search and quickly find the information I urgently needed (and I work at Google!).<br />
<br />
Thankfully my son was OK, but the point is this stuff really matters: one in 20 Google searches are for health-related information. And you should find the health information you need more quickly and easily. <br />
<br />
So starting in the next few days, when you ask Google about common health conditions, you’ll start getting relevant medical facts right up front from the <a href=""http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html"">Knowledge Graph</a>. We’ll show you typical symptoms and treatments, as well as details on how common the condition is—whether it’s critical, if it’s contagious, what ages it affects, and more. For some conditions you’ll also see high-quality illustrations from licensed medical illustrators. Once you get this basic info from Google, you should find it easier to do more research on other sites around the web, or know what questions to ask your doctor.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KutWxLtJgzE/VNlxVLji2MI/AAAAAAAAPwk/ei4NkzspBz4/s1600/health-info-animated.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KutWxLtJgzE/VNlxVLji2MI/AAAAAAAAPwk/ei4NkzspBz4/s1600/health-info-animated.gif"" height=""400"" width=""225"" /></a></div>We worked with a team of medical doctors (led by our own Dr. Kapil Parakh, M.D., MPH, Ph.D.) to carefully compile, curate, and review this information. All of the gathered facts represent real-life clinical knowledge from these doctors and high-quality medical sources across the web, and the information has been checked by medical doctors at Google and the Mayo Clinic for accuracy.<br />
<br />
That doesn’t mean these search results are intended as medical advice. We know that cases can vary in severity from person to person, and that there are bound to be exceptions. What we present is intended for informational purposes only—and you should always consult a healthcare professional if you have a medical concern. <br />
<br />
But we hope this can empower you in your health decisions by helping you learn more about common conditions. We’re rolling it out over the next few days, in the U.S. in English to start. In the long run, not only do we plan to cover many more medical conditions, but we also want to extend this to other parts of the world. So the next time you need info on frostbite symptoms, or treatments for tennis elbow, or the basics on measles, the Google app will be a better place to start. <br />

The spotlight is back on Lance Armstrong and it’s not helping the cyclist’s already damaged reputation. Back in December, Armstrong and his girlfriend Anna Hansen were involved in a hit-and-run accident involving parked cars. At the time, Hansen said she was driving the car during the incident—but it turns out Armstrong was actually the <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/03/us/lance-armstrong-cited/"">one behind the wheel</a>, leading to two misdemeanor charges, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=lance%20armstrong&amp;date=today%207-d&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">rising interest</a> on trends and more embarrassment for the star.<br />

7462515419474175487,,Google Blogs,2015-02-02T11:00:00-08:00,Google RISE Awards support girls and minorities in tech—from Australia to Mexico ,"<i>(Cross-posted on the <a href=""http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/"">Google for EDU Blog</a>)</i><br />
<br />
When Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people need support, they turn to their daughters. In a culture whose history goes back 50,000 years, 70 young girls are using technology to give their families a new way to call for help in emergencies. Last year, Engineers Without Borders Australia taught a group of students to build an emergency response beacon using basic hardware and some code to transmit a user’s location and distress message via radio.<br />
<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up less than 3 percent of Australia’s population, and they’ve historically faced discrimination in society, including in education. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, dropout rates exceed 60 percent in certain regions and Aboriginal students are, on average, 2.5 years behind their peers in scientific and mathematical literacy. The problem is often compounded for girls, who tend to be left out of educational opportunities.<br />
<br />
So <a href=""http://www.ewb.org.au/"">Engineers Without Borders Australia</a> (EWBA) set out to close the educational and digital divide, developing a program which brings together Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal girls to create emergency beacons from scratch by coding a Raspberry Pi to work with an LED, GPS module and FM transmitter. It will also work through issues of stereotyping and discrimination, and help the girls to better understand each other’s worlds.<br />
<br />
This is just one example of an organization doing extraordinary work to make computer science (CS) education available to women and other underrepresented minorities. Computer science has tremendous potential to make a real difference in the world—but only when more people can access and harness it.<br />
<br />
That’s the idea behind Google’s <a href=""http://www.google.com/edu/rise"">RISE Awards</a>, through which we support organizations in their work to inspire students around the world with CS. Since 2010, more than 200 organizations have received an award, and this year, <a href=""https://www.google.com/edu/resources/programs/google-rise-awards/#!award-recipients"">37 organizations</a> are receiving a cumulative $1.5 million to keep this vital effort humming along. Our partners facilitate programs and activities including teaching girls about the <a href=""https://www.womensaudiomission.org/"">intersection of coding and music production in California</a>, promoting computational thinking through <a href=""http://sgd.cs.colorado.edu/wiki/Scalable_Game_Design_Mexico:_Chic@s_Code"">game-design in Mexico</a>, and <a href=""http://www.computacaonaescola.ufsc.br/"">inspiring children in Brazil to program alongside their parents</a>. <iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEICKDdCszA"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
This year, three nonprofits will receive a new “RISE Partnership Award”—a grant to work with one or two partner organizations to help grow their CS outreach to a wider scale. One of the three is Engineers Without Borders Australia, which plans to work with MEET—an organization with expertise on how coding skills can build relationships and break down stereotypes—to integrate their curriculum to reach up to 2,000 girls across Australia, including in Aboriginal communities.<br />
<br />
With access to hands-on CS education, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander girls are preparing themselves for the digital economy, contributing to the diversity of our future’s technology, and taking concrete steps to rise above the inequities their community has faced for decades. They’re not alone. We hope that through the RISE Awards and <a href=""http://www.google.com/diversity/"">our other efforts</a> to support diversity in technology, these girls and others like them can have an even greater impact. We can’t wait to see it.<br />

That’s true on YouTube and Google too—people watched more game-day ads and teaser videos on YouTube than ever before, YouTube hosted its first-ever halftime show, and a throwback PSA became a top trending search term. Here’s a look at the top trending searches, videos and more across Google and YouTube:<br />
<br />
<b>Battle of the brands </b><br />
As the battle for football supremacy was taking place on the field, a very different one was raging across the country: Which ad would reign supreme? Whether via smartphone, tablet or laptop, people spent nearly 4 million hours watching game-day ads and teaser videos on YouTube—up from 2.2 million hours from this time last year. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2mvysnqT1NE/VM-ejbb0GcI/AAAAAAAAPug/9FuvRjmCkxQ/s1600/TopAdsQuestions_OGBPost.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2mvysnqT1NE/VM-ejbb0GcI/AAAAAAAAPug/9FuvRjmCkxQ/s1600/TopAdsQuestions_OGBPost.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></div>This year’s most popular ads came from a wide range of advertisers—newcomers and veterans alike. But one thing’s for certain—<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAsjRRMMg_Q"">puppies</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9A1NowrnGI"">pranks</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTwzsV3I3OQ"">Kim Kardashian</a> continue to “break the Internet.” Here are some of the ads that scored big on YouTube so far:<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Dp18fBIaiNM/VM_JuJdoYmI/AAAAAAAAPvQ/2KjBKdV1yUo/s1600/YouTube-Superbowl-2-r1.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Dp18fBIaiNM/VM_JuJdoYmI/AAAAAAAAPvQ/2KjBKdV1yUo/s1600/YouTube-Superbowl-2-r1.jpg"" height=""640"" width=""585"" /></a></div><b>Tom Brady and Missy Elliott dominate on search</b><br />
While people turned to YouTube to watch the ads, people turned to Google to search for everything from “how old is Tom Brady” to “buffalo chicken dip recipes” to “Katy Perry Halftime performance.” Before kickoff, people asked Google “Why did John Travolta call Idina ‘Adele'?”—a throwback to John Travolta’s infamous mispronunciation of National Anthem performer Idina Menzel's name at the 2014 Oscars. Searchers were also interested in Menzel’s performance, asking “How long will it take Idina to sing the National Anthem?”<br />
<br />
Tom Brady, Marshawn Lynch and Russell Wilson were the top three searched players before, during and after the game. Thanks to some standout in-game performances, by the end they were sharing the spotlight with Rob Gronkowski and Chris Matthews (replacing Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor). And MVP Tom Brady wasn’t just a winner on the field—he captured the title of “Most Searched Quarterback” in every state except for the Seahawks’ home Washington.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rAQOTbSQP9U/VM-ejQ786CI/AAAAAAAAPuc/hbfm0rl4uj4/s1600/QBMap_OGBPost.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rAQOTbSQP9U/VM-ejQ786CI/AAAAAAAAPuc/hbfm0rl4uj4/s1600/QBMap_OGBPost.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></div>Of course, for many people the halftime show is the highlight of the night, and Katy Perry’s performance delivered. She came in on a lion, danced with sharks and went out on a star—one that was, for some, reminiscent of NBC’s old “The More You Know” PSAs. The phrase ""the more you know"" spiked 190x in search for the 10 minutes after Katy’s starry flight. And although Missy Elliott was a late addition to the halftime lineup, she was a popular topic in search. Top questions related to Missy Elliott included “When was Missy Elliott popular?” and “How does Katy Perry know Missy Elliott?”<br />
<br />
<b>A very YouTube halftime show </b><br />
For the first time ever, this year YouTube hosted a halftime show produced by Collective Digital Studio, with the help of more than 25 YouTube creators including <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/EpicMealTime"">Epic Meal Time</a>'s Harley Morenstein as host, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/RhettandLink"">Rhett &amp; Link</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/TobyTurner"">Toby Turner</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/freddiew"">Freddie Wong</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/TylerWardMusic"">Tyler Ward</a>.

People across the country are gearing up for this weekend’s Super Bowl, starting with the basics: “<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=When+Is+The+Super+Bowl&amp;std=20150125&amp;pn=p1#a=20150125-When+Is+The+Super+Bowl"">When is the Super Bowl</a>?” They’re also researching some of the major characters of Sunday’s face-off—namely Seahawks running back <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Marshawn+Lynch&amp;std=20150127&amp;pn=p1#a=20150127-Marshawn+Lynch"">Marshawn Lynch</a> and Patriots coach <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Bill+Belichick&amp;std=20150124&amp;pn=p1#a=20150124-Bill+Belichick"">Bill Belichick</a>—and getting the jump on the ads on YouTube (you’ve already watched more than 100 million minutes’ worth!), including a controversial <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Godaddy+Puppy+Commercial&amp;std=20150128&amp;pn=p1#a=20150128-Godaddy+Puppy+Commercial"">GoDaddy ad</a>.

With all the football hubbub, people still found time to search for other sports happenings. Last Friday, baseball fans mourned the death of <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Ernie+Banks&amp;std=20150123&amp;pn=p1#a=20150123-Ernie+Banks"">Ernie Banks</a>, a.k.a. Mr. Cub, a beloved shortstop and Hall of Famer. And that same night, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Klay+Thompson&amp;std=20150123&amp;pn=p1#a=20150123-Klay+Thompson"">Klay Thompson</a> of the Golden State Warriors scored a record-breaking 37 points in one quarter.<br />
<br />
<b>Who you gonna call?</b><br />
An all-female <i>Ghostbusters</i>, that’s who. Rumors about next year’s reboot of the 80’s classic have been looming over us like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man for a while now, but now it’s all but confirmed that the 2016 film will feature Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon. Searches for each of the actresses spiked faster than you could say “proton pack,” and <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Kate+McKinnon&amp;std=20150127&amp;pn=p1#a=20150127-Kate+McKinnon"">Kate McKinnon</a> was the #2 search overall on Tuesday. In other leading-lady casting news, <i>Harry Potter</i> alum <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Emma+Watson&amp;std=20150126&amp;pn=p1#a=20150126-Emma+Watson"">Emma Watson</a> announced that she’ll play Belle in Disney’s forthcoming live-action <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>.<br />

Headed into this week, the weather was on everyone’s mind, at least on the East Coast. Searches for terms like [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=weather&amp;std=20150126&amp;pn=p1#a=20150126-weather"">weather</a>], [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Blizzard+2015&amp;std=20150126&amp;pn=p1#a=20150126-Blizzard+2015"">blizzard 2015</a>], [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Juno&amp;std=20150126&amp;pn=p1#a=20150126-Juno"">juno</a>], [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=National+Weather+Service&amp;std=20150125&amp;pn=p1#a=20150125-National+Weather+Service"">National Weather Service</a>] and [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Weather+Nyc&amp;std=20150125&amp;pn=p1#a=20150125-Weather+Nyc"">weather NYC</a>] were all hot—or, cold, as the case may be.

Though the storm in New York amounted to little more than an excuse for a snow day, it dumped up to three feet of snow in parts of New England. Definitely enough to merit all those pre-storm searches!<br />
<br />
And moving from the blizzard to the desert, Michelle Obama made headlines when she appeared in Riyadh to mark the death of King Abdullah—without a veil or headscarf. Searches spiked as people tried to find out if the First Lady intended her attire as a political statement. Others noted that she’s certainly not the first to go bareheaded: Hillary Clinton, Angela Merkel, Laura Bush and Condoleezza Rice have, too.<br />
<br />
<b>One down, eight to go</b><br />
File under “stranger than fiction”: [zombie cat] was trending in search this week after a 23-month old kitten in Florida seemingly came back from the dead. After being hit by a car and buried, Bart proved the old “nine lives” adage true when he reappeared in a neighbor’s yard five days later. We’d say that after his trials, Bart deserves a cozy new bed at home, like a <a href=""http://www.skymall.com/serenity-cat-pod/AF6102.html"">Serenity Cat Pod</a> from <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=SkyMall&amp;std=20150123&amp;pn=p1#a=20150123-SkyMall"">Skymall</a>, but, well… <br />

Now, Google Fiber is live in Kansas City, Provo and Austin, and we've started to see how gigabit Internet, with speeds up to 100 times faster than today’s basic broadband, can transform cities. It can give them new platforms for economic development and new ways of using technology to improve life for their citizens. And, around the country, it seems to be catching on.<br />
<br />
Check out the <a href=""http://www.kcstartupvillage.org/"" target=""_blank"">Kansas City Startup Village</a> and Provo learn-how-to-code hub <a href=""https://devmounta.in/faq"" target=""_blank"">DevMountain</a>. Take a look at the <a href=""https://medium.com/@reidrobison/how-google-fiber-is-changing-the-game-for-genomics-20a6e67af092"" target=""_blank"">work of a geneticist</a> whose speedy connection could one day help newborns in intensive care, or how one city's network is connecting a high school classroom to an underwater microscope so students can study oceanic life in the Pacific... from Chattanooga, Tenn. There are many more stories like this—stories about how people are using gigabit internet to spark innovation, inspire creativity, and collaborate in ways they simply couldn't before. And we want to see even more.<br />
<br />
So, today, we’re happy to announce that Google Fiber is coming to 18 cities across four <a href=""https://fiber.google.com/newcities/"" target=""_blank"">new metro areas</a>: <a href=""https://fiber.google.com/cities/atlanta/home/"" target=""_blank"">Atlanta</a>, <a href=""https://fiber.google.com/cities/charlotte/home/"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte</a>, <a href=""https://fiber.google.com/cities/nashville/home/"" target=""_blank"">Nashville</a>, and <a href=""https://fiber.google.com/cities/raleighdurham/home/"" target=""_blank"">Raleigh-Durham</a>.

Bringing Google Fiber to these cities is a long-term investment. We’ve been working closely with city leaders over the past year on a <a href=""http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/checking-in-on-checklist.html"" target=""_blank"">joint planning process</a> to get their communities ready for Google Fiber—and now the really hard work begins. Our next step is to work with cities to create a detailed map of where we can put our thousands of miles of fiber, using existing infrastructure such as utility poles and underground conduit, and making sure to avoid things like gas and water lines. Then a team of surveyors and engineers will hit the streets to fill in missing details. Once we’re done designing the network (which we expect to wrap up in a few months), we’ll start construction.  <br />

<br />
Today, we aren't the only ones talking about gigabit broadband. From the White House to main street, a chorus of new voices is standing up for speed. Just last week during the <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/20/remarks-president-state-union-address-january-20-2015"" target=""_blank"">State of the Union</a>, the President called for faster networks so that innovators and entrepreneurs can build the next big idea. New research from the Fiber to the Home Council <a href=""http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/gigabit-enthusiasm-economic-reality.html"" target=""_blank"">shows</a> gigabit networks are contributing billions of dollars in economic growth.

<b>Deflate-gate and other scandals</b><br />
Super Bowl drama is already here, and it’s not even February 1. After the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Patriots&amp;std=20150120&amp;pn=p1#a=20150120-Patriots"">New England Patriots</a> dominated the Indianapolis Colts 45-7 to win the AFC Championship, news broke out that 11 out of the 12 balls used by New England quarterback <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Tom+Brady&amp;std=20150122&amp;pn=p1#a=20150122-Tom+Brady"">Tom Brady</a> were <a href=""http://espn.go.com/boston/nfl/story/_/id/12202450/nfl-says-new-england-patriots-had-inflated-footballs-afc-championship-game"">under inflated</a>, which is a no-no in the NFL. The league has strict rules about the air pressure in game day balls since alterations could give one team an advantage. Both Brady and head coach Bill Belichick are singing Shaggy's greatest hit “It Wasn’t Me,” so we’ll all have to wait and see how the mystery unfolds.<br />
<br />
On the other “football” field, U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team goalkeeper <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Hope+Solo&amp;std=20150121&amp;pn=p1#a=20150121-Hope+Solo"">Hope Solo</a> is back in trouble with the law after she and her husband, Jerramy Stevens, were pulled over for suspicions of driving under the influence. The kicker? This all happened while Stevens was driving the U.S. team van, which promptly resulted in a 30-day suspension for Solo. This event comes just seven days after charges of domestic violence were dropped against the athlete. <br />

On Tuesday, President Obama delivered his sixth <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=State+of+the+Union&amp;std=20150119&amp;pn=p1#a=20150119-State+of+the+Union"">State of the Union</a> address to outline his legislative agenda for the year ahead. Then, on Thursday, the President took <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbR6iQ62v9k"">questions</a> about his remarks from YouTube Creators. While topics like education, the economy and foreign relations got people searching, the Internet had a <a href=""http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2015/01/twitter-explodes-with-awesome-memes-after-obama-hammers-republican-heckling/"">field day</a> after Obama dropped the proverbial mic at the expense of his Republican counterparts during his speech. In the midst of his talk, Obama stated “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fI5-BZyzRU#t=17"">I have no more campaigns to run</a>,” generating applause from some of his opponents. But Obama -- not one to be the butt of a joke -- responded as smooth as butter: “I know because I won both of them.” Burn. <br />

Search left people salivating after news that milk’s favorite cookie, the Oreo, was getting a new flavor inspired by Valentine’s Day. Confection-maker Nabisco decided to bring cupcake and cookie together in holy matrimony with the launch of a red velvet version of their snack on February 2. And as some people tried to satisfy their sweet tooth, it looks like Tiger Woods may have lost his...literally. The famed golfer made an appearance at his girlfriend <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Lindsey+Vonn&amp;std=20150119&amp;pn=p1#a=20150119-Lindsey+Vonn"">Lindsey Vonn’s</a> World Cup skiing race in Italy sporting a <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-tiger-woods-tooth-20150121-story.html"">missing tooth</a>, causing a stir on the web as people tried to find an explanation for his gap-toothed smile.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, things took a turn for the worse at the happiest place on earth. Disneyland was <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/21/health/disneyland-measles/"">linked</a> to an outbreak of more than 50 cases of the measles. Health officials are declaring the park safe for those who have their immunizations, but the situation has drummed up more controversy around the anti-vaccination movement. <br />

El Capitan is a stunning sight on a normal day—the sheer granite face rising above the valley in Yosemite National Park is hard to miss. But this week, people around the world had an extra reason to keep their eyes on El Cap: two mountain climbers, Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson, made history on Wednesday when they completed the first ever free climb of the 3,000-foot wall.

Back on firm ground, Ohio State beat #2-ranked Oregon in an upset victory in the College Football Playoff championship. Though the Buckeyes may have won on the field, the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Oregon+Ducks&amp;std=20150112&amp;pn=p1#a=20150112-Oregon+Ducks"">Ducks</a> still held the top of the search charts, with more than 2 million searches on Monday.

6061517114463091028,,Google Blogs,2015-01-16T11:42:00-08:00,"Honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. through community service ","This Monday, January 19, we’re celebrating the life and legacy of <a href=""https://www.google.com/#q=Dr.+Martin+Luther+King"">Dr. Martin Luther King</a> and marking the national <a href=""http://mlkday.gov/"">MLK Day of Service</a>. It’s a holiday that’s especially meaningful this year: 2015 marks the 50th anniversary of the <a href=""https://www.google.com/#q=Selma+to+Montgomery+March"">Selma to Montgomery March</a>, and it’s a time when civil rights is at the forefront of our national conversation. <br />
<br />
Next Monday, Googlers across the country are heeding the call to give back to their communities, and we hope you’ll join us. Take some time to honor Dr. King by volunteering in your community—you can find opportunities at <a href=""http://allforgood.org/"">All for Good</a>. In the meantime, here’s a look at some of the projects Googlers will be participating in, and the reasons why they’ve made the commitment to serve this MLK Day. <br />
<br />
Dona Bellow, a legal assistant, will be helping middle school students in New York with computer science and STEM activities. She says, ""doing something to help further the goals of someone else is reclaiming power: power to choose love over conflict, power to recognize and celebrate our differences, power to achieve an equitable outcome for all.” <br />
<br />
In California, Googlers will be volunteering with the Northern California Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Foundation  as it hosts <a href=""http://sfmlkday.org/Events.html"">a full day of festivities</a> including the annual parade/march in San Francisco. Eliana Murillo, who is head of multicultural marketing and will be participating in Monday’s event, told us that “giving a hand to those in need helps build compassion and understanding of the diversity of life experiences.” <br />
<br />
Leadership coordinator Aerica Banks says that she serves to ”break down barriers and build community. We are all able to serve, and we all stand to benefit.” She helped organize volunteers in our Atlanta office for the Atlanta Food Bank Kids In Need program event, which provides school supplies free of charge to teachers in low-income schools. <br />
<br />
And Fabian Elliott, from our ads team in Chicago, helped organize Google volunteers in the Windy City to help middle school students practice compassion by writing letters to children struggling with terminal illnesses. He says, “Even the most obscure challenges of the world impact each of us at varying levels...It’s as simple as doing something that you love that supports a cause you believe in. What are you waiting for?” <br />
<br />
Dr. King said: ""Life's most persistent and urgent question is: 'What are you doing for others?'"" Googler volunteers are joining in the national efforts to honor the legacy of Dr. King—and we know that a commitment to service goes well beyond Monday. So we also <a href=""http://www.google.org/community/"">support projects</a> throughout the year to help to deepen our connections with local communities. Together, let’s make Martin Luther King Jr. Day “<a href=""http://www.serve.gov/?q=site-page/mlkday"">a day on, not a day off</a>!” <br />

Asked through YouTube video submissions or live via Google+ Hangouts, these questions always bring an interesting perspective to the issues the president addresses in his speech. This year we’re doing something we’ve never done before: bringing a handful of YouTube creators directly to the White House to talk with the president in person in a live broadcast on Thursday, January 22.<br />
<br />
YouTube creators <a href=""http://youtube.com/BethanyMota"">Bethany Mota</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/glozell1"">GloZell Green</a> and <a href=""http://youtube.com/vlogbrothers"">Hank Green</a> will interview President Obama about the top concerns facing them and their audiences. Over the next few days, the creators will ask you to share the questions you have for the president, some of which may be asked during the interview. In years past, people across the United States have used this interview to ask important questions about jobs, immigration and even <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp_zigxMS-Y&amp;#t=45m25s"">Valentine’s Day</a>.

If you've ever asked for ""pain"" in Paris and gotten funny looks, confused ""embarazada"" with ""embarrassed"" in Mexico, or stumbled over pronunciation pretty much anywhere, you know the feeling. Now <a href=""http://translate.google.com/about/intl/en_ALL/#"">Google Translate</a> can be your guide in new ways. We’ve updated the Translate app on <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&amp;hl=en"">Android</a> and <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-translate/id414706506?mt=8"">iOS</a> to transform your mobile device into an even more powerful translation tool. <br />
<br />
<b>Instant translation with Word Lens </b><br />
The Translate app already lets you use camera mode to snap a photo of text and get a translation for it in 36 languages. Now, we’re taking it to the next level and letting you instantly translate text using your camera—so it’s way easier to navigate street signs in the Italian countryside or decide what to order off a Barcelona menu. While using the Translate app, just point your camera at a sign or text and you’ll see the translated text overlaid on your screen—even if you don't have an Internet or data connection. <br />
<br />
This instant translation currently works for translation from English to and from French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish, and we’re working to expand to more languages.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-80X1LKaBFLI/VLXQYFGAR6I/AAAAAAAAPsQ/4R74bu0PbYQ/s1600/Google%2BWord%2BLens%2BiPhone%2BGIF.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-80X1LKaBFLI/VLXQYFGAR6I/AAAAAAAAPsQ/4R74bu0PbYQ/s1600/Google%2BWord%2BLens%2BiPhone%2BGIF.gif"" /></a></div><b>Have an easier conversation using the Translate app </b><br />
When talking with someone in an unfamiliar language, conversations can... get... realllllllly... sloowwww. While we’ve had real-time conversation mode on Android since 2013, our new update makes the conversation flow faster and more naturally. <br />
<br />
Starting today, simply tap the mic to start speaking in a selected language, then tap the mic again, and the Google Translate app will automatically recognize which of the two languages are being spoken, letting you have a more fluid conversation. For the rest of the conversation, you won’t need to tap the mic again—it'll be ready as you need it. Asking for directions to the Rive Gauche, ordering <i>bacalhau</i> in Lisbon, or chatting with your grandmother in her native Spanish just got a lot faster. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/jZII2ksensw"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
</div>These updates will be coming to both Android and iOS, rolling out over the next few days. This is the first time some of these advanced features, like camera translations and conversation mode, will be available for iOS users.<br />
<br />
More than 500 million people use Google Translate every month, making more than 1 billion translations a day to more easily communicate and access information across languages. Today’s updates take us one step closer to turning your phone into a universal translator and to a world where language is no longer a barrier to discovering information or connecting with each other. <br />

From a tragedy in Paris to buzz around the new Calvin Klein ads, read on to find out how the year got started on search. <br />
<br />
<b>“Je suis Charlie”</b><br />
The world was left in a state of disbelief on Wednesday after three gunmen stormed into the Paris office of <i><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Charlie+Hebdo&amp;std=20150107&amp;pn=p1#a=20150107-Charlie+Hebdo"">Charlie Hebdo</a></i>, a satirical news magazine, and killed 12 people, including the paper’s editor Stéphane “Charb” Charbonnier. The shooters targeted the publication in response to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/world/europe/french-magazine-publishes-cartoons-mocking-muhammad.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Europe&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article&amp;_r=0"">satirical cartoons</a> depicting the Prophet Mohammed. Interest in the outlet reached an <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=charlie%20hebdo&amp;date=today%201-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">all-time high</a> on the web and people looked for more information about “<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Je%20suis%20Charlie&amp;date=today%201-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz="">Je suis Charlie</a>” (“I am Charlie”), a slogan adopted by free speech supporters in the wake of the shootings. A manhunt for the suspects finally ended Friday in a standoff at a printing company just outside of Paris, in which the two brothers behind the attacks were killed. Meanwhile, France mourns what is being called the country’s “worst terrorist attack in generations.”<br />
<br />
<b>The goals we can’t promise to keep</b><br />
You know what they say—new year, new you. Searchers took to the Internet this week to find out how they could turn their new year’s resolutions into reality. And the usual suspects of diet and weight loss were on everyone’s list. The <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=DASH+Diet&amp;std=20150106&amp;pn=p1#a=20150106-DASH+Diet"">Dash Diet</a> made it onto the trends charts after it took the number one spot on The U.S. News &amp; World Report’s annual rankings of the best diets. Created by physicians to help treat high blood pressure, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) emphasizes fruits, veggies, whole grains and low sodium. So long, carbs; it was nice knowing you. <br />
<br />
We’re working to get our bodies photo-shoot ready, but Justin Bieber has beaten us to the punch. “Beliebers” everywhere were left drooling over a new Calvin Klein <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/justin-biebers-calvin-klein-ads-make-everyone-everywhere-question-everything-162197"">underwear ad</a>. Meanwhile, Justin’s campaign co-star, Dutch model Lara Stone, is getting some unwanted attention: she received <a href=""http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/23109/1/lara-stone-receives-death-threats-over-calvin-klein-campaign"">several death threats</a> from Bieber’s fans.<br />

The year’s not even two weeks old and people are already excited for what’s to come. If you blinked, you probably missed tickets for <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=COACHELLA+2015&amp;std=20150106&amp;pn=p1#a=20150106-COACHELLA+2015"">Coachella 2015</a>, the star-studded desert music festival. The concert sold out after a <a href=""http://www.pe.com/articles/festival-757689-coachella-minutes.html"">mere 40 minutes</a>! And comic book fans (and Paul Rudd loyalists) went into a frenzy when Marvel released the trailer for their latest superhero flick, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Ant+Man&amp;std=20150106&amp;pn=p1#a=20150106-Ant+Man"">Ant Man</a>. Our take? This smells like a Millennial version of <i>Honey I Shrunk the Kid</i>s.<br />
<br />
Finally, while many were looking ahead to this year’s entertainment, others took the time to remember a legend. This week, searchers were feeling sentimental for <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Elvis+Presley&amp;std=20150108&amp;pn=p1#a=20150108-Elvis+Presley"">Elvis Presley’s</a> 80th birthday and revisited the King’s classic songs and memorable white suits.<br />
<br />
<b>Tip of the week</b><br />
Don’t let this be another year of resolution failure: use Google to set reminders for all of your goals. Just say “Ok Google, remind me to go to the gym” when you’re ready to commit to 365 days of sweat. <br />

We'd had a similar thought and were eager to help—though given everything that’s happened, the security implications were very much at the front of our minds.  <br />
<br />
Of course it was tempting to hope that something else would happen to ensure this movie saw the light of day. But after discussing all the issues, Sony and Google agreed that we could not sit on the sidelines and allow a handful of people to determine the limits of free speech in another country (however silly the content might be).  <br />
<br />
So starting at 10 a.m. PST in the U.S., you can rent or buy ""The Interview"" on <a href=""http://play.google.com/"">Google Play</a> and <a href=""http://youtube.com/movies"">YouTube Movies</a>.

And we're joining in to help spread the <a href=""https://happyholidays.withgoogle.com/"">holiday cheer</a>. This month, Google.org is giving more than $15 million in grants to organizations using technology to address some of the world’s biggest problems. From San Francisco to Western Africa, these organizations are making a direct impact on people around the world, every day. <br />
<br />
One of our grants will go to <a href=""http://google.org/global-impact-awards/feeding-america/"">Feeding America</a>. Each year, billions of pounds of surplus food are sent to landfills, while <a href=""http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/err-economic-research-report/err173.aspx"">49 million Americans</a> (including one in five children) go hungry. Our grant will help support their newest food rescue initiative called the Online Marketplace, a program that connects local retail and foodservice businesses who have excess food to those in need. Feeding America serves 3.3 billion meals annually and the Online Marketplace is projected to lead to the recovery of an additional 740 million meals, significantly reducing food waste while giving more families access to food. <br />
<br />
Two of our other grantees are working on the front lines to help ensure lives aren't lost to preventable diseases. <a href=""http://google.org/global-impact-awards/nexleaf/"">Nexleaf Analytics</a> works to get life-saving vaccines to children in India and Mozambique by preserving these vaccines before they spoil by installing low-cost refrigerator sensors in clinics. <a href=""http://google.org/global-impact-awards/seed-funding/#content-malaria-no-more"">Malaria No More</a> is fighting to save lives by better understanding the spread of malaria using newly available mobile data to map malaria cases and how they are being treated.<br />

<br />
We're inspired by all the people out there who are working to make a difference—whether it's one of these organizations or simply one person doing a good deed for another. We're glad to do our part spreading some love this holiday season, and look forward to seeing more world-changing work in 2015. <br />

You mustn't lose it.” The passing of beloved comedian and actor <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/2014/story/robin-williams.html"">Robin Williams</a> shook the world, bringing many people online to search for more information and to remember—and putting Williams in the #1 spot on our global trends charts. There was even an uptick in searches related to depression tests and mental health in the days following his death. We revisited his iconic roles in movies like <i>Aladdin</i> and <i>Dead Poets Society </i>and found solace in <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/6GzVPXu.gif"">gifs</a> and <a href=""http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/robin-williams-quotes-ideas-can-change-the-world.jpg"">memes</a> that captured Williams’ spirit.<br />

<b>All the world’s a stage</b><br />

The <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/2014/story/world-cup.html"">World Cup</a> in Brazil had its fair share of unforgettable moments and had everyone glued to their TVs and mobile devices all summer. From Luis Suarez’s bite heard around the world, to Tim Howard's superman performance vs. Belgium, to Germany’s incredible run to their fourth title, the competition certainly lived up to its reputation and topped the charts. <br />

While sports brought people together, so did a good cause. This year, awareness for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, better known as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s Disease, reached an all-time high around the world due to the viral <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/2014/story/als.html"">ALS Ice Bucket Challenge</a>. As celebrities and everyday people alike braved a bucket of ice cold water for a cause, donations to help find a cure for the illness hit almost $100 million.<br />

How could a plane just vanish into thin air? In the wake of the disappearance of <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/2014/story/mh370.html"">Malaysia Airlines Flight 370</a>, that question propelled the mystery to the global trends charts. As the investigation continued on the ground and online, people stayed hopeful for a happy ending despite the dim odds: searches for “mh370 found” outnumbered searches for “mh370 lost.”<br />

<br />
<b>The presidency is just my day job</b><br />
Being the President of the United State is no easy task, but Barack Obama may have just faced his toughest test yet...a seat on <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Colbert+Report&amp;std=20141209&amp;pn=p1#a=20141209-Colbert+Report"">The Colbert Report</a>. This is the Commander-in-Chief’s third time on the show, but it’s still no cakewalk with every topic up for grabs—including Obama’s less than ideal approval ratings and his graying hair. Obama proved himself up for the challenge, though, kicking Colbert off his segment and <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-president-obama-takes-command-of-the-colbert-report-20141209-story.html"">making it his own</a>.<br />
<br />
Not only does Obama moonlight as a comedian—it turns out he can also code. At a White House event with 30 middle school students, the President kicked off <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Hour+of+Code&amp;std=20141208&amp;pn=p1#a=20141208-Hour+of+Code"">Hour of Code</a>, a program that encourages young people to develop their computer and software programming skills. With a little help from one of the kids, Obama wrote a single line of JavaScript, “moveForward(100),” to move the tutorial’s character 100 pixels to the right, and in the process becoming the<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/09/obama-code_n_6294036.html""> first U.S. president </a>to write a computer program.<br />

<b>Winners and losers</b><br />
Competition on <i><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=The+Voice&amp;std=20141210&amp;pn=p1#a=20141210-The+Voice"">The Voice</a></i> is heating up; the three finalists were revealed this week. But there’s a twist in the show’s seventh season: to spice things up, its creators introduced a new wildcard spot, bringing the total number of potential finalists to four. Now the nine remaining contestants who didn’t make it to the top three will duke it out for that fourth spot and a shot at singing glory. <br />
<br />
While <i>The Voice</i> contestants still have a chance to take home the grand prize, other stars were left out in the cold this week when the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Golden+Globe+nominations&amp;std=20141211&amp;pn=p1#a=20141211-Golden+Globe+nominations"">Golden Globe </a>nominations included several snubs. Names left off the selection sheet were Angelina Jolie and her upcoming film <i>Unbroken</i>, Christopher Nolan and his much-hyped <i>Interstellar</i>, and Bradley Cooper, who <a href=""http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Bradley-Cooper-Gained-Ton-Weight-American-Sniper-67543.html"">gained 40 pounds</a> to portray Chris Kyle in the biopic film <i>American Sniper</i>. Oh well—there's still the Oscars. Meanwhile, movies <i>Birdman </i>and<i> Boyhood</i> snapped up seven and five nominations, respectively—and the TV category is staying interesting with nods for several Netflix original series, Amazon’s first appearance with <i>Transparent</i>, and two surprise nominations for the CW’s quirky <i>Jane the Virgin</i>.<br />
<br />
<b>The sky above</b><br />
This week, searchers spent a good chunk of their time looking up. The <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=San+Francisco+Weather&amp;std=20141210&amp;pn=p1#a=20141210-San+Francisco+Weather"">weather</a> was top of mind as the Pineapple Express—no, not the film—hit the San Francisco Bay Area, causing flooding and power outages. The phenomenon gets its name from its origins in the waters near Hawaii, a.k.a. the Pineapple State, where it develops before heading towards the U.S Pacific Coast.  <br />
<br />
Even for those of us trapped indoors, searchers got a chance to look at the stars...on our homepage at least. Searchers looked for more information about astronomer <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Annie+Jump+Cannon&amp;std=20141210&amp;pn=p1#a=20141210-Annie+Jump+Cannon"">Annie Jump Cannon</a> after a Google doodle marked her 151st birthday. Cannon—who was deaf for most of her adult life, and often overshadowed by her colleague Edward C. Pickering—was instrumental in the development of the Harvard Classification system, which categorizes stars by their temperature (whether or not they were nominated for a Golden Globe).<br />

<b>Tip of the week</b><br />
Need to find something in the apps on your Android phone? Now you can ask your Google app for help—even if it’s in another app. Just say “Ok Google” and then “search YouTube for holiday decorating ideas” or “search Tumblr for Taylor Swift” and jump straight to those results within the other app (if you have it installed). <br />
<br />
And come back next week for Google's Year in Search—a review of the people, moments, and events that captured the world's attention.<br />

Some are circular, others are square. Some are traditional, others are sporty. And that’s exactly the point. With different shapes and styles, it’s really easy to make your watch your own.<br />
<br />
So by all means: wear what you want.<br />

<br />
<b>Signs of the season</b><br />
Now that the turkey’s been carved, and even the leftovers have been gobbled (pun intended) up in the form of sandwiches and soup, the holiday season is officially underway. People shopped<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Cyber+Monday&amp;std=20141130&amp;pn=p1#a=20141130-Cyber+Monday""> Cyber Monday</a> sales, and others were excited to learn that <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=USPS&amp;std=20141202&amp;pn=p1#a=20141202-USPS"">USPS </a>would be delivering packages seven days a week in some cities. <br />
<br />
Plus, holiday <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/recommended?sp=CAYIFAgTCBIwAFovCilwcm9tb3Rpb25fNDAwMGNhY19yZWFkeWZvcmhvbGlkYXlzX21vdmllcxAHGAQ%3D%3AS%3AANO1ljLSnzo&amp;c=movies&amp;hl=en"">movies</a> and songs are trending as people get into the spirit. And even if you didn’t watch <i>Love Actually</i> (for the 14th time) this week, chances are you heard a peep of <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Mariah+Carey&amp;std=20141203&amp;pn=p1#a=20141203-Mariah+Carey"">Mariah Carey</a>’s now-classic “All I Want For Christmas Is You,” which the singer performed live at Rockefeller Center’s tree lighting ceremony on Wednesday. Unfortunately, Mimi missed a few notes, leading searches for her to spike as a result. <br />
<br />
<b>Citizens speak out</b><br />
On Wednesday, a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict the police officer involved in the death of <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Eric+Garner&amp;std=20141203&amp;pn=p1#a=20141203-Eric+Garner"">Eric Garner</a>, who died in July after being placed in a choke hold.

<b>Digital dough</b><br />
Good news for Thin Mint fans: you no longer have to wait with bated breath for the day your co-worker shows up with an order form, or for that card table stacked with colorful boxes to show up outside your grocery store. Girl Scout Cookies have gone digital. Scouts will have personal cookie webpages where people can place orders online; the idea is that girls will learn more about online marketing and e-commerce while satisfying the sweet teeth of the rest of us. It brings a whole new meaning to the phrase “Internet cookies.”<br />
<br />
<b>Astronomical views</b><br />
If you weren’t at the mall last weekend, then chances are you were on YouTube, watching the new <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Star+Wars+Trailer&amp;std=20141128&amp;pn=p1#a=20141128-Star+Wars+Trailer"">trailer</a> for <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i>.

Fans have intensely scrutinized and discussed each one of the trailer’s 88 seconds in detail; and there are already spoofs and recreations galore, including Wes Anderson and LEGO versions. The movie won’t be out until December 2015, so you have plenty of time to build your crossguard lightsaber for the premiere. <br />
<br />
But even after two years, there’s no video in the YouTube galaxy that’s quite like “Gangnam Style.” It’s the first video to ever get more than 2 billion views, and this week, its view count crossed 2,147,483,647. That happens to be the highest number that can be represented by a 32-bit integer, and also—until recently—the highest number that the YouTube view counter could display. Luckily, our friends at YouTube saw this one coming: They upgraded the view counter to use a 64-bit integer, capable of representing numbers up to  9,223,372,036,854,775,808. Yup, that’s 9 quintillion. Consider this gauntlet thrown. <br />

<b>Tip of the week</b><br />
Between holiday parties, gift shopping and the end-of-year scramble at work, it’s no wonder some errands start to slip your mind. Let Google help keep track—just say “Ok Google, remind me to pick up ribbon when I’m at Target” or “Ok Google, remind me to chill the champagne when I get home” to get a reminder.<br />

8244111398984846304,,Google Blogs,2014-12-02T07:03:00-08:00,This year the holidays are Made with Code ,"<i>Cross-posted on the <a href=""http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/"">Google for Education Blog</a></i><br />
<br />
Carol-singing, hot chocolate, latkes and ice skating are all things that get us into the spirit of the holidays. But now there’s a new way to deck the halls: with code. <br />
<br />
Earlier this year, we introduced a program called Made with Code to inspire millions of girls to try coding, and help them understand the creative things they can do with computer science. Starting today on <a href=""http://madewithcode.com/"">madewithcode.com</a>, girls can use the introductory programming language Blockly to animate the lights of the state and territory trees that will decorate President’s Park, one of America’s 401 national parks and home to the White House, through the holiday season.<br />
<br />
The programmed lights will debut at the <a href=""http://thenationaltree.org/"">92nd annual National Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony</a>, which will be <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/whitehouse"">livestreamed</a> by the White House on Thursday and air on PBS nationally throughout December in partnership with the National Park Foundation and National Park Service. The tradition of the tree lighting ceremony dates back to 1923 when President Calvin Coolidge lit the first fir tree outside the White House, and this is the first year kids from across the country will be in control of the state and territory holiday tree  lights!<br />

<br />
As the mom of two girls, I know that technology is a pathway for their future success. Still, even as coding becomes more important, less than 1% of high school girls say they’re interested in pursuing computer sciences in college.  But I'm also an engineer, so I’ve seen firsthand how exciting CS can be. I fell in love with code early—my dad was an engineer and he encouraged me to enter a programming competition in the seventh grade. I gave it a shot, and I’ve never looked back. Ever since that day, I’ve known that when I program something, I’m creating something totally new for the world.<br />
<br />
That’s what Made with Code is about: discovering that creating something new and exciting—whether it’s a holiday tree, a video game or a driverless car—can be accomplished with the power of code.<br />
<br />
But it’s also about building an ecosystem of support for girls through parents and teachers, and to show girls other women who are using CS to achieve their dreams. This challenge also kicks off Google’s commitment to CSEdWeek, a week dedicated to inspiring students to get interested in computer science that’s become one of the biggest education initiatives online.  Over the coming week, thousands of Googlers will join the <a href=""http://csedweek.org/"">hour of code</a>, and announce a few other special projects that we will fund through the holiday season and coming year.<br />
<br />
I’m heading to Washington, D.C. this week to be a part of the ceremony, and I’m looking forward to watching the designs from girls across the country lighting up the nation’s capital—and inspiring my daughters and so many others with the power of code. <br />

A toymaker with a mission decided it was makeover time for Barbie, the doll everyone loves to hate. Nickolay Lamm created “normal Barbie,” a doll that everyone could relate to -- less “material girl” and more “girl next door”—non-size zero waist included. Reflecting <a href=""http://nickolaylamm.com/art-for-clients/what-would-barbie-look-like-as-an-average-woman/"">the body</a> of the average 19-year old woman, both parents and kids have taken a liking to the fact that toy actually...looks like a real person (<a href=""http://time.com/3593968/the-new-normal-barbie-comes-with-an-average-womans-proportions-and-cellulite-sticker-extension-packs/"">she looks like my sister!</a>) Complete with freckles and acne sticker expansion packs, we think Lamm’s got the awkward teenage years down pat.<br />

Even Kim, however, had some company in the trending ranks from Taylor Swift, who has come close to breaking the Internet a few times herself. This week, Swift released a new video (and <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/11/7192795/taylor-swift-blank-space-app-is-the-best-version-of-myst-starring-taylor-swift"">app</a>) for her song “<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Blank+Space&amp;std=20141110&amp;pn=p1#a=20141110-Blank+Space"">Blank Space</a>,” putting a new spin on the “boy-crazy” meme and garnering more than 25 million YouTube views—that’s more than 10 times as many as last week’s viral video sensation “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrGrOK8oZG8"">Too Many Cooks</a>.”<br />

Ten years after leaving Earth, on Wednesday the European Space Agency’s Rosetta mission achieved history. It successfully landed its <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Philae+Lander&amp;std=20141112&amp;pn=p1#a=20141112-Philae+Lander"">Philae</a> probe on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and began sending pictures of the surface back to scientists. People turned to search to learn more, including “what is next for the probe?” It’s a good question, since the probe bounced twice before settling into a position about 1km off its target, and may not be able to get enough battery life from its solar panels to continue operating as intended. <br />

And all eyes were on the New York skyline this week—or at least on 1 World Trade Center, where a pair of window washers were trapped 69 stories high on the side of the building for over an hour on Wednesday before being rescued. The 1,776-foot tall skyscraper had just opened for business last week, more than a decade after the September 11 attacks. <br />

<b>Numbers game</b><br />
Kobe Bryant set a new record on Tuesday night, but he might wish he hadn’t. The shooting guard missed his 13,418th career field goal in a game against the Memphis Grizzlies, earning him the dubious honor of the most missed field goals in the NBA. Of course, Bryant also has the fourth-most points in league history—and five championship rings. So, he’s probably doing OK.<br />

5023144945956930289,,Google Blogs,2014-11-11T06:00:00-08:00,The doors are open for veterans at Google,"My father was a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Airmen"">Tuskegee Airman</a>, one of the first African-American military aviators in the U.S. military. He got his wings in 1944 and stayed in the Army for 30 years. When I think of him—and all the other veterans I grew up knowing—I’m reminded of the unique characteristics they shared: their innate courage, sense of purpose, and their ability to lead under pressure. Most remarkable to me, though, is their belief in the power of sacrificing and fighting for something bigger than yourself. <br />
<br />
For everyone who has served our country, I join 1,000+ members of the <a href=""http://www.google.com/about/careers/veterans/our-community.html"">Google Veterans Network</a> in celebrating Veterans Day today. And I am incredibly proud of what Google has done to honor veterans, including two initiatives new this year. <br />
<br />
<b>Veterans make great Googlers</b><br />
We hire leaders, team builders and problem solvers and many veterans are already doing amazing things at the company. But we also know that not all veterans have the same skills and interests; there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution and it can be hard to understand how you might fit into a corporate environment. So we’ve created a new <a href=""http://g.co/vets"">Veterans Careers</a> website to help servicemembers and veterans find the right role to apply for at Google. The site breaks down some of the ways our own veterans are succeeding in both technical and general roles. In their own words, they explain how their skills translated and how they are continuing to serve through their work at Google.<br />
<br />
And for those who have other career goals in mind, we’ve included a few <a href=""http://www.google.com/about/careers/veterans/more-resources.html"">resources</a>—like mentoring programs and virtual classes—to help veterans and their families as they transition to civilian life.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/NHz-iGYs5Mo"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
<b>Sharing veterans’ stories</b><br />
In addition to making Google a great place to work for veterans, we want to use our technology to build greater awareness and understanding of their achievements and sacrifices. Last Friday, the <a href=""http://www.911memorial.org/"">9/11 Memorial</a> opened a new exhibit that explores the immediate and heroic actions of U.S. servicemembers, alongside those of the emergency workers who responded on and after September 11, 2001. “The Call to Serve,” an interactive installation powered by Google <a href=""http://g.co/tourbuilder"">Tour Builder</a>, follows the stories of nine veterans and military personnel to honor their service and that of all who followed in their footsteps. You can visit the exhibit in person at the 9/11 Museum during Veterans Week or online at <a href=""http://veterans.911memorial.org/"">911memorial.org/calltoserve</a>. <br />
<br />
This effort also builds on other historical preservation projects we announced earlier this year, including bringing <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@38.876393,-77.072408,3a,75y,92.16h,91.95t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1s_CLrX_eTGD8oQ2UPLi2MfQ!2e0!3e5"">Arlington National Cemetery</a>, including the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and The Eternal Flame, to Street View; and commemorating the 70th anniversary of the <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/entity/%2Fm%2F01lhv6"">landings at Normandy</a> in partnership with museums and archives in the U.S., U.K. and France. <br />
<br />
We’re proud to pay tribute to veterans’ service and and to support them in their careers. Veterans have unique skills and experience, and arrive with a devotion to teamwork that goes a long way around here. They’re among our greatest assets, both as a company and as a nation. And after all they’ve given us, we need to give them every opportunity to succeed.<br />

<br />
Students and schools have done some amazing things with Chromebooks since we first <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/05/new-kind-of-computer-chromebook.html"">launched in 2011</a>. At the Urban Promise Academy in Oakland, Calif., students are using the <a href=""http://scratch.mit.edu/"">Scratch program</a> to create their own video games on Chromebooks. In Chesterfield County, Virginia, students get access to feedback and support from teachers after school hours using their Chromebooks. And in Fairfield County, South Carolina, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYp6WBvqmeM#t=102"">schools saw double-digit gains</a> on their state performance tests after they started to offer Chromebooks, Google Apps for Education and other technologies to their students, who often don’t have Internet access at home.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>A student at Urban Promise Academy uses a Chromebook to design video games</i></div>
<br />
Schools tell us that Chromebooks fill three big needs: they’re easy for students and teachers to use, they’re easy to share, and they’re easy to manage. That’s critical for schools that often want to give their students the best technology, but don’t have a large IT department to support it. And it’s part of what has made Chromebooks such a hit in schools. In fact, according to IDC’s latest report on tablets and laptops in K-12 education, Chromebooks are the best-selling device in the U.S. this year. And they’re continuing to grow in popularity—in districts like Montgomery County, MD (more than 50,000 devices), Charlotte-Mecklenberg, NC (32,000 devices) and Cherry Creek, CO (26,000 devices), who have all begun using Chromebooks in 2014. <br />
<br />
Beyond the U.S., countries are looking at how they can use technology in the classroom on a large scale—like in <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/for-malaysia-bringing-google-apps-and.html"">Malaysia</a>, where the entire national school system is using Chromebooks. This week, we’re hosting the <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/2ndglobaleducationsympoium/"">Global Education Symposium</a>, a gathering of education ministers from 18 countries working to implement technology that will help them meet their country’s educational agenda. We’ll hear from education leaders who are exploring new educational models, and look at how innovative local schools are using technology to help teachers and students excel. <br />
<br />
It’s been thrilling to see how Chromebooks—alongside Android tablets, Google Play for Education, Classroom and Google Apps for Education, which is now used by 40 million students and teachers around the world—can help students meet their learning goals. We can’t wait to see what’s ahead as more students around the world gain access to new learning opportunities through technology.<br />

Bradlee is remembered for his courageous journalism; during his tenure as editor of the Post, the outlet published the “Pentagon Papers” and reported on the Watergate Scandal. Always chasing a good story, Bradlee coined the term “mego” (“my eyes glaze over”) for any reporting that bored him—unknowingly foreshadowing Internet-speak.<br />

342831880803685722,,Google Blogs,2014-10-22T10:00:00-07:00,An inbox that works for you,"Today, we’re introducing something new. It’s called <b>Inbox</b>. Years in the making, Inbox is by the same people who brought you Gmail, but it’s not Gmail: it’s a completely different type of inbox, designed to focus on what really matters. <br />
<br />
Email started simply as a way to send digital notes around the office. But fast-forward 30 years and with just the phone in your pocket, you can use email to contact virtually anyone in the world…from your best friend to the owner of that bagel shop you discovered last week. <br />
<br />
With this evolution comes new challenges: we get more email now than ever, important information is buried inside messages, and our most important tasks can slip through the cracks—especially when we’re working on our phones. For many of us, dealing with email has become a daily chore that distracts from what we really need to do—rather than helping us get those things done.<br />
<br />
If this all sounds familiar, then Inbox is for you. Or more accurately, Inbox works for you. Here are some of the ways Inbox is at your service:<br />
<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/bzNTjpUMOp4?rel=0"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
<br />
<b>Bundles: stay organized automatically</b> <br />
Inbox expands upon the categories we introduced in Gmail last year, making it easy to deal with similar types of mail all at once. For example, all your purchase receipts or bank statements are neatly grouped together so that you can quickly review and then swipe them out of the way. You can even teach Inbox to adapt to the way you work by choosing which emails you’d like to see grouped together. <br />
<br />
<b>Highlights: the important info at a glance</b><br />
Inbox highlights the key information from important messages, such as flight itineraries, event information, and photos and documents emailed to you by friends and family. Inbox will even display useful information from the web that wasn’t in the original email, such as the real-time status of your flights and package deliveries. Highlights and Bundles work together to give you just the information you need at a glance.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ER2zK_WbRqU/VEfW8rXOtJI/AAAAAAAABWs/wqr0h77iZoE/s1600/inbox-nexus6-500.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ER2zK_WbRqU/VEfW8rXOtJI/AAAAAAAABWs/wqr0h77iZoE/s600/inbox-nexus6-500.png"" height=""600"" /></a></div><b>Reminders, Assists, and Snooze: your to-do’s on your own terms</b><br />
Inbox makes it easy to focus on your priorities by letting you add your own Reminders, from picking up the dry cleaning to giving your parents a call. No matter what you need to remember, your inbox becomes a centralized place to keep track of the things you need to get back to. <br />
<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody>
<tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--NopP77zG2A/VEfXORfnNSI/AAAAAAAABW0/NfMf8MnDpOk/s1600/bigtopblog_fullres.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--NopP77zG2A/VEfXORfnNSI/AAAAAAAABW0/NfMf8MnDpOk/s400/bigtopblog_fullres.gif"" /></a></td></tr>
<tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">A sampling of Assists</td></tr>
</tbody></table>And speaking of to-do’s, Inbox helps you cross those off your list by providing Assists—handy pieces of information you may need to get the job done. For example, if you write a Reminder to call the hardware store, Inbox will supply the store’s phone number and tell you if it's open. Assists work for your email, too. If you make a restaurant reservation online, Inbox adds a map to your confirmation email. Book a flight online, and Inbox gives a link to check-in.<br />
<br />
Of course, not everything needs to be done right now. Whether you’re in an inconvenient place or simply need to focus on something else first, Inbox lets you Snooze away emails and Reminders. You can set them to come back at another time or when you get to a specific location, like your home or your office.<br />
<br />
<b>Get started with Inbox</b><br />
Starting today, we’re sending out the first round of invitations to give Inbox a try, and each new user will be able to invite their friends. If Inbox can’t arrive soon enough for you, you can email us at <a href=""mailto:inbox@google.com"">inbox@google.com</a> to get an invitation as soon as more become available. <br />
<br />
When you start using Inbox, you’ll quickly see that it doesn’t feel the same as Gmail—and that’s the point. Gmail’s still there for you, but <a href=""https://www.google.com/inbox/#utm_source=googleblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=launch"">Inbox is something new</a>. It’s a better way to get back to what matters, and we can’t wait to share it with you.   <br />

<br />
<b>A cast of characters</b><br />
Search will always have its fair share of characters and this week was no different. First up, moviegoers learned who’s next in line for Hollywood’s superhero treatment when <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Ezra+Miller&amp;std=20141015&amp;pn=p1#a=20141015-Ezra+Miller"">Ezra Miller</a>, star of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, landed the title role in the 2018 film The Flash. And whispers are swirling in Tinseltown that <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Gal+Gadot&amp;std=20141015&amp;pn=p1#a=20141015-Gal+Gadot"">Gal Gadot's</a> already impressive resume—she’s set to play the world’s most famous Amazonian, Wonder Woman—will soon get another stellar addition, the lead female role in a remake of Ben-Hur. <br />
<br />
But they weren’t the only celebrities to get the Internet buzzing. Comedian and fan favorite <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Zach+Galifianakis&amp;std=20141014&amp;pn=p1#a=20141014-Zach+Galifianakis"">Zach Galifianakis</a> caused a stir on the trends charts after he revealed a much thinner version of himself on the red carpet of the New York Film Festival. When a <a href=""http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/10/how-did-zach-galifianakis-lose-all-that-weight.html"">reporter asked</a> Galifianakis if he had made any lifestyle changes to lose the weight, he responded with a straight face, “No, I'm just... I'm dying.” Clearly Galifianakis isn’t sharing his weight loss secrets. <br />
<br />
<b>Out with the old, in with the new</b><br />
HBO has seen the light! This week the premium television network announced that they will launch a new stand-alone service for fans of its TV shows. Soon, homes without a cable subscription can sign up for HBO Go and get their fill of Game of Thrones and other HBO shows with just an Internet connection—leading people to wonder if this is the <a href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2014/1016/First-HBO-then-CBS-offer-streaming.-Is-this-the-end-of-the-cable-bundle-video"">beginning of the end</a> for cable providers.<br />
<br />
Consumers also had a lot of new mobile devices to choose from this week, starting with our own line of Nexus gadgets like the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Nexus+6&amp;std=20141015&amp;pn=p1#a=20141015-Nexus+6"">Nexus 6</a> running the latest version of Android, 5.0 Lollipop.

<b>The show’s just getting started</b><br />
Is it awards show season already? It’s not—but that’s not stopping searchers from looking ahead. The Internet rejoiced when How I Met Your Mother and Gone Girl star Neil Patrick Harris said “Hosting the 2015 Academy Awards? Challenge accepted!” But with the Oscars red carpet still months away, searchers had their sights set on another celebrity bash: <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Paul+Rudd&amp;std=20141016&amp;pn=p1#a=20141016-Paul+Rudd"">Paul Rudd's</a> keg party… at his <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/16/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/paul-rudd-kansas-city-royals/index.html?hpt=hp_t2"">mom’s house</a>… in the suburbs of Kansas City. What else are you supposed to do when mom’s out of town and the KC Royals just punched a ticket to the World Series after a nearly 30-year hiatus? <br />

2761664650817777233,,Google Blogs,2014-10-15T09:04:00-07:00,Android: Be together. Not the same.,"Good things happen when everybody’s invited. A few years ago, we had the thought that phones (and stuff that hadn’t even been invented yet like tablets and smart watches) would be way more interesting if everyone could build new things together. So we <a href=""http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/11/google-launches-android-open-mobile.html"">created</a> Android as an open platform, and put it out there for everyone to imagine, invent, make, or buy whatever they wanted. <br />
<br />
Since then, all kinds of people—from companies big and small to folks on Kickstarter, kids in schools, and crazy smart developers—have been innovating faster, <i>together</i>, more than we ever could alone. And the best part is that every time someone new joins in, things get more interesting, unexpected, and wonderful for all of us. <br />

Getting everyone in on the party is the same spirit behind <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/for-next-five-billion-android-one.html"">Android One</a>—an effort recently launched in India (coming to other countries soon) to make great smartphones available to the billions of people around the world who aren’t yet online. It’s also why we’re excited about Lollipop, our newest software release, which is designed to meet the diverse needs of the billion-plus people who already use <a href=""http://www.android.com/"">Android</a> today.<br />
<br />
<b>Joining the party: Android 5.0 Lollipop</b><br />
As <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/06/google-io-2014-keynote.html"">previewed</a> at Google I/O, Lollipop is our largest, most ambitious release on Android with over 5,000 new APIs for <a href=""http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2014/10/android-50-lollipop-sdk-and-nexus.html"">developers</a>. Lollipop is designed to be flexible, to work on all your devices and to be customized for you the way you see fit. And just like Android has always been, it’s designed to be shared. <br />
<a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zZ1iCaBd2XU/VD4MaIQ1wMI/AAAAAAAAPfQ/t0J7eveSy1Y/s1600/Lollipop%2BForest.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zZ1iCaBd2XU/VD4MaIQ1wMI/AAAAAAAAPfQ/t0J7eveSy1Y/s1600/Lollipop%2BForest.jpg"" height=""360"" width=""640"" /></a><br />
Lollipop is made for a world where moving throughout the day means interacting with a bunch of different screens—from phones and tablets to TVs. With more devices connecting together, your expectation is that things just work. With Lollipop, it’s easier than ever to pick up where you left off, so the songs, photos, apps, and even recent searches from one of your Android devices can be immediately enjoyed across all the other ones. <br />
<br />
As you switch from one screen to another, the experience should feel the same. So Lollipop has a consistent design across devices—an approach we call <a href=""http://www.google.com/design"">Material Design</a>. Now content responds to your touch, or even your voice, in more intuitive ways, and transitions between tasks are more fluid.<br />
<br />
Lollipop also gives you more control over your device. You can now adjust your settings so that only certain people and notifications can get through, for example, when you’re out to dinner or in the middle of an important meeting. And when an important notification does come through, you can see it directly from the lockscreen.<br />
<br />
And because we’re using our devices a lot more, there’s a new battery saver feature that extends the life of your device by up to 90 minutes—helpful if you’re far from a power outlet. We’ve enabled multiple user accounts and guest user mode for keeping your personal stuff private. And you can now secure your device with a PIN, password, pattern, or even by pairing your phone to a trusted device like your watch or car with Smart Lock. But this is just a small taste of Lollipop. Learn more on <a href=""http://android.com/"">android.com</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Meet the Nexus family, now running Lollipop</b><br />
Advances in computing are driven at the intersection of hardware and software. That's why we’ve always introduced <a href=""http://google.com/nexus"">Nexus devices</a> alongside our platform releases. Rather than creating software in the abstract, we work with hardware partners to build Nexus devices to help push the boundaries of what's possible. Nexus devices also serve as a reference for the ecosystem as they develop on our newest release. And for Lollipop, we have a few new <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk-PY2dBKaA&amp;list=PL-t6ViojWR4x_IZMCGAxpwnHscqfBNk_v"">Nexus treats</a> to share with you.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WrgpWwvjKRA/VD5-8lA9iZI/AAAAAAAAPfg/e6OtUbYu0as/s1600/Nexus-Family.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WrgpWwvjKRA/VD5-8lA9iZI/AAAAAAAAPfg/e6OtUbYu0as/s1600/Nexus-Family.jpg"" height=""328"" width=""640"" /></a></div>
First, with Motorola, we developed the <a href=""http://google.com/nexus/6"">Nexus 6</a>. This new phone has a contoured aluminum frame, a 6-inch Quad HD display and a 13 megapixel camera. The large screen is complemented by dual front-facing stereo speakers that deliver high-fidelity sound, making it as great for movies and gaming as it is for doing work. It also comes with a Turbo Charger, so you can get up to six hours of use with only 15 minutes of charge.<br />
<br />
Next, a new tablet built in partnership with HTC. <a href=""http://www.google.com/nexus/9"">Nexus 9</a>, with brushed metal sides and 8.9-inch screen, is small enough to easily carry around in one hand, yet big enough to work on. And since more and more people want to have the same simple experience they have on their tablets when they have to do real work, we designed a keyboard folio that magnetically attaches to the Nexus 9, folds into two different angles and rests securely on your lap like a laptop.<br />
<br />
Finally, we’re releasing the first device running Android TV: <a href=""http://google.com/nexus/player"">Nexus Player</a>, a collaboration with Asus, is a streaming media player for movies, music and videos. It's also a first-of-its-kind Android gaming device. With Nexus Player you can play Android games on your HDTV with a gamepad, then keep playing on your phone while you're on the road. Nexus Player is Google Cast Ready so you can cast your favorite entertainment from almost any Chromebook or Android or iOS phone or tablet to your TV.<br />
<br />
Nexus 9 and Nexus Player will be available for pre-order on October 17. Nexus 9 will be in stores starting November 3. Nexus 6 will be available for pre-order in late October and in stores in November—with options for an unlocked version through Play store, or a monthly contract or installment plan through carriers, including AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon. Specific carrier rollout timing will vary. Check out <a href=""http://google.com/nexus"">google.com/nexus</a> for more details on availability.  <br />
<br />
Android 5.0 Lollipop, which comes on Nexus 6, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player, will also be available on Nexus 4, 5, 7, 10 and Google Play edition devices in the coming weeks.<br />
<br />
<b>The party’s just getting started</b><br />
With this latest release of Android Lollipop, we're excited to continue working with our developer community, hardware partners, and all of you. More ideas and more creators is what gets us all to better ideas faster. And since everyone's invited to the party, we hope you'll join in the fun by <a href=""http://www.androidify.com/"">creating and sharing an Android character</a> that captures a little bit of who you are—one of a kind. Enjoy!<br />

4051890388078344815,,Google Blogs,2014-10-14T14:16:00-07:00,OMG! Mobile voice survey reveals teens love to talk,"“Ok Google, do I need an umbrella today?” “How tall do you need to be to ride the Cyclone?” “How long does a goat live?” People of all ages are starting to talk to their devices more regularly—in fact, our data also show mobile voice searches more than doubled in the past year. But how, why and where do people use voice search? To find out, we commissioned a study, conducted by Northstar Research, surveying 1,400 Americans across all age groups. Here are the results:<br />
<br />
We weren’t surprised to find that teens—always ahead of the curve when it comes to new technology—talk to their phones more than the average adult. More than half of teens (13-18) use voice search daily—to them it’s as natural as checking social media or taking selfies. Adults are also getting the hang of it, with 41 percent talking to their phones every day and 56 percent admitting it makes them “feel tech savvy.”<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lxYdOZ6knwI/VD2RJ8udfOI/AAAAAAAAPeM/XfQGUOTCF24/s1600/Voice1-p01.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lxYdOZ6knwI/VD2RJ8udfOI/AAAAAAAAPeM/XfQGUOTCF24/s1600/Voice1-p01.jpg"" height=""396"" width=""400"" /></a></div>
Both teens and adults are asking their phones for directions and using it to help skip the hassle of typing in phone numbers. And it’s pretty clear a lot of people are relying on voice search for multitasking: they talk to their phones while watching TV (38 percent) and 23 percent of adults use voice search while cooking. Apparently, it’s becoming common kitchen etiquette to ask your mobile device: “Ok Google, how many ounces are in a gallon?”—all while making sure your screen stays crumb-free. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6vq_ZlqGtL0/VD2RJ6pvQ2I/AAAAAAAAPeE/J4Yz0lrg74M/s1600/Voice1-p02.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6vq_ZlqGtL0/VD2RJ6pvQ2I/AAAAAAAAPeE/J4Yz0lrg74M/s600/Voice1-p02.jpg"" height=""600"" /></a></div>
While people of all ages ask practical questions, it’s teens who are exploring all angles, with nearly one-third talking to their phones to get help with homework. I see my kids asking my phone questions like: “Ok Google, who was the sixth president of the U.S.?” or “what’s the tallest mountain in Europe?” On the bright side, teens are ditching voice search in the classroom: 74 percent of them think using voice search at school is unacceptable. In fact, most admit to using voice search “just for fun”—I know my daughter finds it pretty amusing to tell her phone: “Ok Google, play Olivia Holt’s ‘Fearless’” to start a dance party.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p0rGkyZF0Bo/VD2RKM5IJgI/AAAAAAAAPeI/-CkBf4WNuzU/s1600/Voice1-p03.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p0rGkyZF0Bo/VD2RKM5IJgI/AAAAAAAAPeI/-CkBf4WNuzU/s600/Voice1-p03.jpg"" height=""600"" /></a></div>
And teens don’t seem to associate any stigma with using voice search while hanging out with friends, whereas only one-quarter of adults speak to their phones when in the company of others. Teens don’t mind talking to devices in private as well, with more than one in five admitting to using voice search while in the bathroom! Maybe they’re merely setting reminders like “Ok Google, remind mom to buy toilet paper next time we’re at Safeway.”<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zr6rDTFVxQM/VD2RKov0H0I/AAAAAAAAPeU/tTv44qRdvQ8/s1600/Voice1-p04.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zr6rDTFVxQM/VD2RKov0H0I/AAAAAAAAPeU/tTv44qRdvQ8/s600/Voice1-p04.jpg"" height=""600"" /></a></div>
Though it’s already helping a lot of people save time and simplify their days, there’s also potential for voice search to do a lot more in the future. So we asked people what they wished voice search could one day deliver. And I have to say, I agree with the results! it would be great to rely on my voice to easily find my car keys or TV remote, both of which somehow always end up under the couch cushions.<br />
<br />
And I’m not alone in wishing a simple voice command could save me from having to cook dinner. Forty-five percent of teens—and 36 percent of adults!—wish they could place a pizza delivery order using voice search on their mobile device. We’re not quite there yet, but next time you don’t feel like cooking, just pull out your phone, tap the Google app, and say: “Ok Google, call Round Table Pizza.” You’ll still have to place your order over the phone, but we’re getting closer! <br />

Our idea was to make shopping your favorite local stores as easy and fast as shopping online, and to help you get what you need delivered the same day. Since then, you’ve told us how we helped you restock diapers in the nick of time, made sure you had Bananagrams for family game night, and even made you feel connected to the outside world when you were home sick. Along the way, we've expanded to new locations, brought on more merchants, and offered more products. And now, we’re adding to the program you love.<br />

<br />
We’re also adding more merchants: 16 in total over the last couple of months. We’ve added national brands including 1-800-Flowers, Barnes &amp; Noble, Nine West, PetSmart, Vitamin Shoppe and Sports Authority, and regional merchants such as Paragon Sports in New York and Vicente Foods in Los Angeles. In our new markets, we’ve added regional brands including Stop &amp; Shop in Boston; Giant Food in D.C.; and Lux Roses, TigerDirect, Treasure Island Foods and Wrigleyville Sports in Chicago.<br />

266410811148913637,,Google Blogs,2014-10-10T17:49:00-07:00,Through the Google lens: search trends October 3-9 ,"The Royals are in the playoffs, Carlton’s doing the Carlton and a <i>Cosby Show</i> star is in the news… what decade is this anyway? Here’s a look at a week of search trends so weird, it’s almost a <i>Twin Peaks </i>experience:<br />
<br />
<b>Play ball</b><br />
The National League and American League division series thrilled fans of October baseball this week. KC fans gave their brooms a workout as the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Royals&amp;std=20141005&amp;pn=p1#a=20141005-Royals"">Royals</a> swept the Angels. They’re in the playoffs for the first time in almost 30 years and at an <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F049n7&amp;date=1%2F2014%2012m%2C%201%2F2013%2012m%2C%201%2F2012%2012m%2C%201%2F2011%2012m%2C%201%2F2010%2012m&amp;cmpt=date"">all-time high in search</a> as a result. And after the Cardinals beat the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Dodgers&amp;std=20141003&amp;pn=p1#a=20141003-Dodgers"">Dodgers</a> to make it to their fourth straight NLCS, the only Midwest team that’s not happy is the Tigers, who lost to the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Orioles&amp;std=20141005&amp;pn=p1#a=20141005-Orioles"">Orioles</a> (also a sweep). Meanwhile, the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Giants&amp;std=20141007&amp;pn=p1#a=20141007-Giants"">Giants</a> beat the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Washington+Nationals&amp;std=20141005&amp;pn=p1#a=20141005-Washington+Nationals"">Nationals</a> in a four-game series that was really almost like five games, since Game 2 went an epic 18 innings. The next round starts today. <br />
<br />
<b>Flashbacks</b><br />
Fans of 90s TV shows were breaking out some celebratory dance moves this week, starting, of course, with The Carlton. This week <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Alfonso+Ribeiro&amp;std=20141007&amp;pn=p1#a=20141007-Alfonso+Ribeiro"">Alfonso Ribeiro</a>—former <i>Fresh Prince of Bel Air</i> actor and current Dancing with the Stars contestant—did what we’ve all been hoping for and broke out his famous Carlton dance moves on the show. Not only was Ribeiro wearing a Carltonesque sweater and bowtie, the show’s set was decorated to look like the sitcom. <br />
<br />
News also broke that cult classic&nbsp;<i><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Twin+Peaks&amp;std=20141006&amp;pn=p1#a=20141006-Twin+Peaks"">Twin Peaks</a>&nbsp;</i>is coming back to the screen. Creators David Lynch and Mark Frost will write nine episodes of the murder mystery for a limited run on Showtime. If you’re one of those people who’s like, “Laura Palmer, who?” don’t fret—the new episodes won’t be on the air until 2016, so you have plenty of time to catch up with Agent Dale Cooper between now and then. <br />
<br />
Finally, former <i>Cosby Show</i> and Disney channel star <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Raven+Symone&amp;std=20141006&amp;pn=p1#a=20141006-Raven+Symone"">Raven Symone</a> was top of mind this week after an interview with Oprah in which she discussed personal identity and labels. Oprah told the actress not to “set up the Twitter on fire,” but it didn’t do much good as people took to the web to read more about the actress’ declaration that she is “not African-American.” <br />
<br />
<b>Wings, shmings</b><br />
For nearly two decades, “Red Bull gives you wings” has been the energy drink company’s slogan. This week, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Red+Bull&amp;std=20141009&amp;pn=p1#a=20141009-Red+Bull"">Red Bull</a> agreed to pay more than $13 million after settling a U.S. lawsuit accusing the drink maker of false advertising claims. The plaintiffs argued that Red Bull’s ad campaigns claim the drink gives people special energy benefits. Scientific reports, however, show it offers about the same benefits as a cup of coffee and does not, in fact, give you any wings at all. Searchers looked to find out more about the settlement, which may entitle them to $10, or alternatively, $15 worth of free Red Bull.<br />
<br />
<b>Tip of the week</b><br />
Next time you’re on vacation and looking for a nice place for dinner, <a href=""http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2014/10/fall-into-easier-planning-with-google_9.html"">let Google be your concierge</a>. Open the Google app and say “Ok Google, show me restaurants near my hotel” to see a variety of options. When you find the one you like, you can say “Ok Google, make a reservation there for 7 p.m.” If the restaurant is on OpenTable, you’ll see a reservations screen pop up with the details already filled out—no need to waste time on the phone when you could be enjoying your time off!<br />

As a former startup ourselves, entrepreneurship is still part of Google's DNA. That’s why two and a half years ago we opened our first <a href=""https://www.googleforentrepreneurs.com/campuses/"">Campus</a> in London, a space designed to help entrepreneurs learn, connect, and build companies. <br />
<br />
Campus is a hub for the startup community, where entrepreneurs can fuel up on caffeine at the Campus Cafe, gather in our free event space, rent coworking space, and connect with mentors, accelerators and Google teams. So far, we’ve seen great results at our first locations, <a href=""https://www.campuslondon.com/"">Campus London</a> and <a href=""http://campustelaviv.com/"">Campus Tel Aviv</a>. In 2013, startups at Campus London raised more than $54 million in funding and created more than 570 jobs. They’ve also created great products and services that are reaching consumers and customers. For example, <a href=""https://www.borrowmydoggy.com/"">Borrow My Doggy</a>, which began at a <a href=""http://startupweekend.org/"">Startup Weekend</a> in London and also received funding from Seedcamp, one of our partners, lets dog owners with limited time for walking share their pooches with city dwellers who can't have their own. <a href=""http://eyeteasemedia.com/"">Eyetease</a>, which created a HD digital taxitop and high-speed WiFi system for taxis, has been a resident at Campus since their launch and have grown their revenue 100X during that time. In Tel Aviv, local community groups have hosted more than 1,000 events at Campus (and consumed 6,000+ slices of free pizza!). <br />
<br />
Building on the success of these spaces, this year we've announced new Campuses in Warsaw, Poland, São Paulo, Brazil, and Seoul, South Korea. And today, we’re welcoming another new member to the Campus family:<b> Campus Madrid</b>. We’re excited to open doors in all these new locations in 2015. Each of these cities has a growing startup community, as well as a Google office so our teams can get directly involved with supporting Campus. We hosted more than 1,000 Google mentoring sessions through our Campus Office Hours Program in London, and are planning similar efforts at our other locations.<br />

We’re also trying out new programs at all our locations to help even more aspiring entrepreneurs succeed. For example,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.googleforentrepreneurs.com/startup-communities/campus-for-moms"">Campus for Moms</a> is a baby-friendly startup school for new moms on maternity leave.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.campuslondon.com/programmes/edu/"">CampusEDU</a> offers courses for founders both in person and streamed for free online, like this Friday’s session, <i><a href=""https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/campus-edu-hiring-rockstars-and-keeping-them-tickets-11074240351"">Hiring Rockstars and Keeping Them</a>.</i><br />
<br />
As with all our <a href=""http://google.com/entrepreneurs"">Google for Entrepreneurs</a> programs, we hope Campus will provide a home for entrepreneurs and startup founders, and put resources at their fingertips to help them build transformative products and companies around the world.<br />

<b>Somebody call a doctor</b><br />
This week, searchers went into a frenzy following news that someone had been diagnosed with <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=What+Is+Ebola&amp;std=20140930&amp;pn=p1#a=20140930-What+Is+Ebola"">Ebola</a> on U.S soil—causing a <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=ebola&amp;date=today%207-d&amp;cmpt=q"">surge</a> in interest for the deadly disease. While this hopefully will remain an isolated case in the U.S., the virus is taking its toll on the people in West Africa. The region is experiencing its worst outbreak in history, with more than <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/ebola-virus-has-killed-more-than-3-000-people-says-who-1411894026"">3,000 people</a> dying from the illness. <br />
<br />
<b>An indefinite break</b><br />
It was a bad day at the office for several prominent figures this week as they were asked to step down from their positions. After a couple of bizarre security breaches like allowing the President to share an elevator with <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-rode-elevator-armed-man-criminal-record-sources/story?id=25879349"">an armed man</a> or when a person literally jumped the <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/fence-jumper-white-house-sparks-evacuation-article-1.1946209"">White House fence</a> and walked inside the building (knife in tow), Secret Service director <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Julia+Pierson&amp;std=20141001&amp;pn=p1#a=20141001-Julia+Pierson"">Julia Pierson</a> handed in her resignation. <br />

<b>Crossovers</b><br />
Searchers were saying “what the?” this week as we were hit with a couple of crossovers on TV and in music. First up, two classic American cartoons came together for one night to give viewers double the laughter. The famed Simpsons <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Simpsons+Family+Guy+Crossover&amp;std=20140929&amp;pn=p1#a=20140929-Simpsons+Family+Guy+Crossover"">appeared</a> in an episode of Family Guy. Unfortunately, the laugh track was off this time around and the show received <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/29/6863279/family-guy-simpsons-crossover-bad"">negative reviews</a>, perhaps thanks to an awkward <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UprQl6J7sp0"">seven-minute fight scene</a> between Peter and Homer (d’oh!). And we heard a new take on a popular tune as “The Queen of Soul” Aretha Franklin made a <a href=""http://youtu.be/oNWeGngQqOI"">breathtaking cover</a> of pop-soul star Adele’s song ""Rolling in the Deep."" Listen to it and prepare to have your mind blown. <br />
<br />
<b>Who’s got game?</b><br />
The MLB playoffs are in full, um, swing. The <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Royals&amp;std=20141002&amp;pn=p1#a=20141002-Royals"">Kansas City Royals</a> and their fans had something to cheer about as team made the playoffs for the first time in 29 years, ending the longest postseason drought in North American <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/sports/jenkins/article/Royals-are-hungry-after-29-year-postseason-drought-5789220.php"">sports history</a>—and then eliminating Oakland in an extra-inning thriller. And, after an 8-0 stomping of the Pittsburgh Pirates behind ace Madison Bumgarner, the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=SF+Giants&amp;std=20141001&amp;pn=p1#a=20141001-SF+Giants"">San Francisco Giants</a> are hoping to keep their every-other-year World Series streak alive.  <br />

<b><br />
</b> <b>Shonda, Shonda, Shonda</b><br />
TV fans, rejoice! This week brought premiere episodes for old favorite shows as well as hotly anticipated new ones. Top returning shows on search include CBS’s <i><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Big+Bang+Theory&amp;std=20140922&amp;pn=p1#a=20140922-Big+Bang+Theory"">The Big Bang Theory</a> </i> (natch), and NBC’s <i><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=The+Blacklist&amp;std=20140922&amp;pn=p1#a=20140922-The+Blacklist"">The Blacklist</a> </i>and<i> <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Chicago+Fire&amp;std=20140923&amp;pn=p1#a=20140923-Chicago+Fire"">Chicago Fire</a></i>.

<br />
But premieres week really came to a head on Thursday night, which we prefer to call the Night of Shonda.

Five World Series, more than 3,000 hits and nearly 20 years later, this weekend he will take to the diamond for a final game at Fenway against his archrivals, the Boston Red Sox. Though neither the Yankees nor the Sox made this season’s playoffs, anticipation for Jeter’s farewell at-bat was already high. But last night, after giving baseball fans so many memorable moments over the years, he gave us one more. In his final game at Yankee Stadium, Jeter’s ninth-inning walk-off single gave the Yankees a win over the Orioles, provided the world another excuse to search for the star shortstop, and was a fitting ending to Jeter’s fairy-tale career. <br />
<br />
Over on the political field, Attorney General <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Eric+Holder&amp;std=20140925&amp;pn=p1#a=20140925-Eric+Holder"">Eric Holder</a> announced on Thursday that he is stepping down.

<b>NFL in the news</b><br />

Report.” Simmons is prohibited from tweeting or other public communications until October 15, but Sports Guy supporters took to the web on his behalf, fighting to #FreeSimmons. Finally, this week’s season premiere of <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=South+Park&amp;std=20140924&amp;pn=p1#a=20140924-South+Park"">South Park</a> featured a malfunctioning “GoodellBot” and a plotline about the controversy over Washington’s team name.<br />

9144507794557008805,,Google Blogs,2014-09-25T08:00:00-07:00,You don’t know what you don’t know: How our unconscious minds undermine the workplace,"When YouTube launched their video upload app for iOS, between 5 and 10 percent of videos uploaded by users were upside-down. Were people shooting videos incorrectly? No. Our early design was the problem. It was designed for right-handed users, but phones are usually rotated 180 degrees when held in left hands. Without realizing it, we’d created an app that worked best for our almost exclusively right-handed developer team.<br />
<br />
This is just one example of how unconscious biases influence our actions every day, even when—by definition—we don’t notice them. These biases are shaped by our experiences and by cultural norms, and allow us to filter information and make quick decisions. We’ve evolved to trust our guts. But sometimes these mental shortcuts can lead us astray, especially when they cause us to misjudge people. In the workplace, for example, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect"">halo effect</a> can cause us to inflate performance ratings or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroup_bias"">in-group bias</a> can lead us to overlook great talent. <br />
<br />
Combatting our unconscious biases is hard, because they don’t feel wrong; they feel right. But it’s necessary to fight against bias in order to create a work environment that supports and encourages diverse perspectives and people. Not only is that the right thing to do, but without a diverse workforce, there’s a pretty good chance that our products—just like that early YouTube app—won’t work for everyone. That means we need to make the unconscious, conscious. <br />
<br />
The first step is education; we need to help people identify and understand their biases so that they can start to combat them. So we developed a workshop, <a href=""https://www.gv.com/lib/unconscious-bias-at-work"">Unconscious Bias @ Work</a>, in which more than 26,000 Googlers have taken part. And it’s made an impact: Participants were significantly more aware, had greater understanding, and were more motivated to overcome bias.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/NW5s_-Nl3JE"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
In addition to our workshop, we’re partnering with organizations like the <a href=""http://gender.stanford.edu/"">Clayman Institute</a> and the <a href=""http://adainitiative.org/"">Ada Initiative</a> to further research and awareness. We’re also taking action to ensure that the decisions we make at work—from promoting employees to marketing products—are objective and fair. Here are four ways we're working to reduce the influence of bias:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Gather facts.</b> It’s hard to know you’re improving if you’re not measuring. We collect data on things like gender representation <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-to-raise-the-profile-of-women-and-minorities-in-science/"">in our doodles</a> and <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/06/google-io-women-20-percent/"">at our conferences</a>.</li>
<li><b>Create a structure for making decisions. </b>Define clear criteria to evaluate the merits of each option, and use them consistently. Using the same standards to evaluate all options can reduce bias. This is why we use <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;"">structured interviews</a> in hiring, applying the same selection and evaluation methods for all.</li>
<li><b>Be mindful of subtle cues. </b>Who’s included and who’s excluded? In 2013, Googlers pointed out that of the dozens of conference rooms named after famous scientists, only a few were female. Was this our vision for the future? No. So we changed Ferdinand von Zeppelin to Florence Nightingale—along with many others—to create more balanced representation. Seemingly small changes can have big effects.</li>
<li><b>Foster awareness. Hold yourself—and your colleagues—accountable. </b>We’re encouraging Googlers to call out bias. For example, we share a “bias busting checklist” at performance reviews, encouraging managers to examine their own biases and call out those of others.</li>
</ul>
<br />
As we <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/getting-to-work-on-diversity-at-google.html"">shared</a> back in May, we’re not where we should be when it comes to diversity. But in order to get there, we need to have this conversation. We have to figure out where our biases lie, and we have to combat them. Tackling unconscious bias at work is just one piece of making Google a diverse workplace, but it’s absolutely essential if we’re going to live up to our promise to build technology that makes life better for as many people as possible. <br />

When a gardening project went awry, they discovered a naturally occurring bacteria in soil called Diazotroph. The girls determined that the bacteria could be used to speed up the the germination process of certain crops, like barley and oats, by 50 percent, potentially helping fulfill the rising demand for food worldwide. Oh—and they’re 16 years old. <br />
<br />
Today, Ciara, Émer and Sophie were named the Grand Prize Winner and the 15-16 age category winners of our fourth annual <a href=""http://www.googlesciencefair.com/"">Google Science Fair</a>. They are some of thousands of students ages 13-18 who <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/02/kicking-off-2014-google-science-fair.html"">dared to ask tough questions like</a>: How can we stop cyberbullying? How can I help my grandfather who has Alzheimer's from wandering out of bed at night? How can we protect the environment? And then they actually went out and answered them. <br />
<br />
From thousands of submissions from 90+ countries, our <a href=""https://www.googlesciencefair.com/en/competition/judges"">panel of esteemed judges</a> selected 18 finalists representing nine countries—Australia, Canada, France, India, Russia, U.K., Ukraine and the U.S.—who spent today impressing Googlers and local school students at our Mountain View, Calif. headquarters. In addition to our Grand Prize Winners, the winners of the 2014 Google Science Fair are:<br />

<li><b>13-14 age category: Mihir Garimella (Pennsylvania, USA)</b> for his project <a href=""http://goo.gl/zE9P9R"">FlyBot: Mimicking Fruit Fly Response Patterns for Threat Evasion</a>. Like many boys his age, Mihir is fascinated with robots. But he took it to the next level and actually built a flying robot, much like the ones used in search and rescue missions, that was inspired by the way fruit flies detect and respond to threats. Mihir is also the winner of the very first Computer Science award, sponsored by Google.</li>
<li><b>17-18 age category: Hayley Todesco (Alberta, Canada)</b> for her project <a href=""http://goo.gl/KsDOIY"">Waste to Water: Biodegrading Naphthenic Acids using Novel Sand Bioreactors</a>. Hayley became deeply interested in the environment after watching Al Gore’s documentary “An Inconvenient Truth.” Her project uses a sustainable and efficient method to break down pollutant substances and toxins found in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailings"">tailing</a> ponds water in her hometown, a hub of the oil sands industry.</li>
<li><b>The Scientific American&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/education/science-in-action/"">Science in Action award</a>: Kenneth Shinozuka (Brooklyn, New York)</b> for his wearable sensors project. Kenneth was inspired by his grandfather and hopes to help others around the world dealing with Alzheimer's. The <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/"">Scientific American</a> award is given to a project that addresses a health, resource or environmental challenge.</li>

<b>Flag and country</b><br />
“They may take away our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!” That was Sir William Wallace battlecry for Scottish independence in the film Braveheart. While this week’s events in <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Scotland&amp;std=20140918&amp;pn=p1#a=20140918-Scotland"">Scotland</a> weren’t quite as cinematic, the results could have been revolutionary. On Thursday the world watched and searched as an unprecedented numbers of Scots went to the polls to answer the question, ""Should Scotland be independent from the United Kingdom?"" Turns out the majority of people don’t think it should, and voted to stay a member of the U.K. Party leaders have now promised significant constitutional changes for the entire kingdom. What would Wallace have made of that? <br />
<br />
<b>The comeback kings</b><br />
Everybody loves a comeback and search had its fair share this week. First up, nostalgia for the 90’s brought <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Surge&amp;std=20140915&amp;pn=p1#a=20140915-Surge"">Surge</a> soda back from the dead. Thanks to a Facebook campaign called ""The SURGE Movement,"" Coca-Cola will now sell its ""fully-loaded citrus” soft drink for a limited time on Amazon. And the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Chicago+Bears&amp;std=20140915&amp;pn=p1#a=20140915-Chicago+Bears"">Chicago Bears</a> denied the 49ers a win in their brand-spanking-new stadium when they rallied to overturn a 13-point deficit in the last quarter to beat San Francisco 28-20. <br />

<b>Airing dirty laundry</b><br />
Hard plastic-y seats, broken recliner adjusters, zero leg room—flying economy isn’t always the most pleasant experience. And depending on who you’re sitting next to, your easy two-hour flight could turn into a nightmare before you even take off. But the passengers of the world aren’t having it, not anymore. This week, “passenger shaming” went viral on social media as traumatized travelers shared photos of the most absurdly obnoxious unconscientious things some passenger do on flights—we’re talking bare feet, bare skin... well, you should just <a href=""http://instagram.com/passengershaming"">see for yourself</a>. <br />
<br />
But at least those offending fliers were shielded in anonymity. Singer <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Robin+Thicke&amp;std=20140915&amp;pn=p1#a=20140915-Robin+Thicke"">Robin Thicke</a> wasn’t afforded the same luxury, revealing in a court deposition this week that he had little to do with the creation of last year’s song of the summer “Blurred Lines.” As part of his defense against a copyright infringement lawsuit, Thicke admitted that he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol for most of 2013—bringing a whole new meaning to the song’s title. <br />
<br />
<b>And the winner is ...</b><br />
The hipster revolution has finally taken over the United States! Need proof? Searchers don’t. When New Yorker Kira Kazantsev won the the title of <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Miss+America&amp;std=20140914&amp;pn=p1#a=20140914-Miss+America"">Miss America</a>, the Internet discovered that the U.S.A’s new leading lady is a former food blogger. She’s even reported on her state’s crown foodie jewel, <a href=""http://nypost.com/2014/09/15/how-kira-kazantsev-went-from-cronut-blogger-to-miss-america/"">the cronut</a>. Miss America wasn’t the only who got to bask in the limelight; boxing world champion Floyd “Money” <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Mayweather&amp;std=20140913&amp;pn=p1#a=20140913-Mayweather"">Mayweather</a> Jr. won his rematch with contender Marcos Maidana by an unanimous decision. The victory brings his undefeated tally to 47… somehow the title world champion is starting to sound like an understatement. <br />
<br />
<b>Love on the set!</b><br />
For Orange is the New Black screenwriter <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Lauren+Morelli&amp;std=20140914&amp;pn=p1#a=20140914-Lauren+Morelli"">Lauren Morelli</a>, life imitated art a bit more than she probably expected. While writing the hit program, Morelli decided to divorce her husband and start a relationship with Samira Wiley, an actress from the show. Meanwhile, searchers learned that <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Mindy+Kaling&amp;std=20140915&amp;pn=p1#a=20140915-Mindy+Kaling"">Mindy Kaling</a> considers former The Office castmate and on-screen boyfriend B.J. Novak “<a href=""http://hollywoodlife.com/2014/09/16/mindy-kaling-love-bj-novak-split-relationship/"">the love that got away</a>.” But while not all on-set relationships last, some couples not only make it work but also take their relationship to the next level. That’s the route taken by Ryan Gosling and <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Eva+Mendes&amp;std=20140916&amp;pn=p1#a=20140916-Eva+Mendes"">Eva Mendes</a>, who met while making the movie The Place Beyond the Pines. The power couple welcomed baby girl Gosling earlier this week.<br />

<b>Tip of the week</b><br />

3055572579311921287,,Google Blogs,2014-09-15T02:12:00-07:00,For the next five billion: Android One,"Knowledge is a game changer. I’ve long been inspired by the Internet and how it opens the doors to opportunity. It provides access to knowledge, no matter who you are or where you are. For instance, it doesn’t matter if you’re a Nobel Laureate at a world-class research center or a young student at a rural school in Indonesia, with Google Search, you have the same information at your fingertips as anyone else.<br />
<br />
If we look at how people are getting online and accessing information today, increasingly it’s through a smartphone. While 1.75 billion people around the world already have a smartphone, the vast majority of the world’s population—over five billion more—do not. That means most people are only able to make simple voice calls, rather than connect with family through a live video chat, use mapping apps to find the closest hospital, or simply search the web. We want to bring these experiences to more people. <br />
<br />
That’s where <a href=""http://www.android.com/one"">Android One</a> comes in. At I/O, we <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/06/google-io-2014-keynote.html"">first talked</a> about this initiative to make high-quality smartphones accessible to as many people as possible. And today we’re introducing the first family of Android One phones <a href=""http://www.android.com/one/india"">in India</a>. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tQ8wYvVKQnM/VBYiMPEPgPI/AAAAAAAAPXE/GYeNagvTVIE/s1600/Android-One_white.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tQ8wYvVKQnM/VBYiMPEPgPI/AAAAAAAAPXE/GYeNagvTVIE/s400/Android-One_white.png"" height=""93"" width=""400"" /></a></div>
<b>Addressing key barriers—hardware, software and connectivity</b><br />
There are three big reasons why it’s hard for people in countries such as India, Indonesia or the Philippines to get their hands on a high-quality smartphone. First, is the hardware itself. Even entry-level smartphones still remain out of reach for many (bear in mind that in some of these countries the average monthly income is around $250). Second, many people in these markets do not have access to the latest Android software and popular applications. Finally, even where 3G and 4G networks are available, not enough people have phones that can support data and the plans can be expensive. <br />
<br />
Android One aims to help tackle these challenges. By working closely with phone and silicon chip makers to share reference designs and select components, we’re making it easier for our partners to build phones that are not just great to use, but also affordable. They have lots of processing power, so you can get information quickly. They have high-quality front- and rear-facing cameras. And for all those pictures, along with your apps and videos, Android One phones will have expandable storage. We also added features that people in India will find particularly useful, like dual SIM cards, a replaceable battery and built-in FM radio. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lHw5suXP8VY/VBYiNuSeTCI/AAAAAAAAPXM/ruRKn0IUTYM/s1600/group_UI-visible.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lHw5suXP8VY/VBYiNuSeTCI/AAAAAAAAPXM/ruRKn0IUTYM/s400/group_UI-visible.jpg"" height=""400"" width=""400"" /></a></div>
To help ensure a consistent experience, Android One devices will receive the latest versions of Android directly from Google. So you’ll get all the latest features, up-to-date security patches, and peace of mind knowing your stuff is always backed up. It also means Android One devices will be some of the first to be updated to the Android L release later this year. For our hardware partners, they’ll be able to create customized experiences and differentiate their devices without having to change the core software.<br />
<br />
In an effort to reduce data costs, if you have an Airtel SIM card, you’ll get these software updates for free for the first six months. As part of this same Airtel offer, you’ll also be able to download up to 200MB per month worth of your favorite apps (that’s about 50 apps overall) from Google Play—all without counting toward your mobile data usage. <br />
<b><br />
</b> <b>More to come</b><br />
This is just the beginning of the Android One journey. The first phones, from our hardware partners Micromax, Karbonn, Spice and chipmaker MediaTek, are available starting today in India from leading retailers starting at <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?q=6399inr%20to%20usd#safe=active&amp;q=6399inr+to+usd"">Rs 6,399</a>. We’re also excited to welcome more partners to the program, including phone manufacturers Acer, Alcatel Onetouch, ASUS, HTC, Intex, Lava, Lenovo, Panasonic, Xolo, and chipmaker Qualcomm. We expect to see even more high-quality, affordable devices with different screen sizes, colors, hardware configurations and customized software experiences. Finally, we plan to expand the Android One program to Indonesia, the Philippines and South Asia (Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) by the end of the year, with more countries to follow in 2015.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/X7UPR9z3OV8"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
Access for access’s sake is not enough. With Android One, we not only want to help people get online, we want to make sure that when they get there, they can tap into the wealth of information and knowledge the web holds for everyone.  <br />

The restaurant chain’s new “Never Ending Pasta Pass” offered up to 1,000 people seven weeks of unlimited pasta, salad and those sneaky-good breadsticks for just $100. The rush of pasta lovers eager for a deal crashed the Olive Garden website before the pass was even for sale—and thousands more turned to search to learn more about the debacle.<br />

<b>Football frenzy&nbsp;</b><br />
A full 15 out of 20 top searches on Sunday were related to the first Sunday of football season, with the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Dallas+Cowboys&amp;std=20140907&amp;pn=p1#a=20140907-Dallas+Cowboys"">Cowboys</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Steelers&amp;std=20140907&amp;pn=p1#a=20140907-Steelers"">Steelers</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Denver+Broncos&amp;std=20140907&amp;pn=p1#a=20140907-Denver+Broncos"">Broncos</a> topping the pack—on search, at least. But unfortunately, it was events off the field that had many people turning to the web this week.

5032278300425623113,,Google Blogs,2014-09-11T10:00:00-07:00,Google Drive and the Docs editors: designed with everyone in mind,"Imagine trying to keep track of another person’s real-time edits in a document—using only your ears. Or trying to create a table from spreadsheet data—without being able to clearly see the cells. Whether you’re backing up a file in Drive or crunching some numbers in Sheets, it should be easy to bring your ideas to life using Google’s tools. But if you’re blind or have low vision, you may need to rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers and Braille displays—and that can make working in the cloud challenging. While screen readers can parse static webpages (like this blog) relatively easily, it’s much harder for them to know what to say in interactive applications like Google Docs because the actions they need to describe are much more complex.<br />
<br />
With these reasons in mind, today we’re announcing some improvements to Drive and all our editors—Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, and Forms—specifically designed with blind and low-vision users in mind.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/RLRAstwCdXw"" width=""640""></iframe>
<b>Improved screen reader support&nbsp;in Drive and Docs&nbsp;</b><br />
In June, we introduced a <a href=""http://drive.google.com/?srtp=1&amp;drive_opt_in=1"" target=""_blank"">new version of Drive</a> that’s sleeker, easier to navigate and much faster. But just as importantly, the new Drive also includes better keyboard accessibility, support for zoom and high-contrast mode and improved usability with screen readers.<br />
<br />
Across Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings and Forms, you’ll find that it’s now much easier to use a screen reader, with nicer text-to-voice verbalization and improvements to keyboard navigation. You’ll also notice other updates, including:<br />
<ul>
<li>Support for alt text on images in Docs, so you can tell a screen reader what they should say to describe an image&nbsp;</li>
<li>Better support for using a keyboard to edit charts and pivot tables in Sheets&nbsp;</li>
<li>Additional screen reader improvements specifically for Docs, Sheets and Slides, including support for spelling suggestions, comments and revision history&nbsp;</li>
<li>The ability to quickly search the menus and perform actions in Docs, Slides and Drawings (and soon Sheets and Forms)—even if you don’t know the action’s key sequence&nbsp;<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

</li>
</ul>
Collaborating with others is easier too: in Docs, Sheets, Slides or Drawings, screen readers announce when people enter or leave the document, and you’ll now also hear when others are editing alongside you.<br />
<br />
<b>Refreshable Braille display support&nbsp;</b><br />
If you use a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refreshable_braille_display"" target=""_blank"">Braille display</a>, you can now use it to read and enter text in Docs, Slides and Drawings. Even if you don't use a Braille display, with Braille support, your screen reader’s settings for character echoing are automatically followed. Enabling Braille also dramatically reduces the lag between when you press a key and when it’s announced by your screen reader, and improves the announcements 
of punctuation and whitespace. Learn how to enable Braille support in our <a href=""https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6057417"" target=""_blank"">Help Center</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Get up and going faster</b><br />
The first time you use a screen reader or a Braille display, getting up to speed can be a daunting task. But it’s simpler with new step-by-step guides for <a href=""https://support.google.com/drive/topic/1631585"" target=""_blank"">Drive</a>, <a href=""https://support.google.com/docs/topic/6048194"" target=""_blank"">Docs</a>, <a href=""https://support.google.com/docs/topic/6052233"" target=""_blank"">Sheets</a>, <a href=""https://support.google.com/docs/topic/6050892"" target=""_blank"">Slides</a>, <a href=""https://support.google.com/docs/topic/6048717"" target=""_blank"">Forms</a> and <a href=""https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6058689"" target=""_blank"">Drawings</a>.<br />

Introducing free voice calls from Hangouts,"We know how important it is to keep in touch with friends and family, especially when they’re spread around the world. Hangouts already makes it easy to send a quick message, or start a group video chat.

8909840986714553421,,Google Blogs,2014-09-10T04:00:00-07:00,A solar project on top of an old oil field in California’s Kern County,"We recently finalized an investment that will put a 82MW solar power plant on top of an old oil and gas field in Kern County, Calif. The new deal with SunEdison will generate enough energy to power 10,000 homes.<br />
<br />
Our investment in the Regulus solar project will give new life to a long-valued piece of land, and there's something a little poetic about creating a renewable resource on land that once creaked with oil wells. Over the years, this particular site in California has gone from 30 oil wells to five as it was exhausted of profitable fossil fuel reserves. The land sat for some time and today we’re ready to spiff things up. With the help of our $145 million equity commitment, SunEdison is draping it in high-tech, sleek panels that collect energy from the sun, while bringing 650 jobs to the Kern County area and 82MW of clean energy to the grid.<br />

Like many states, California has a <a href=""http://www.energy.ca.gov/portfolio/"">goal</a> of increasing the amount of energy procured from renewable sources. This project helps support that quest and marks <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/energy/investments/"">17 renewable energy investments</a> for Google since 2010, including five here in the Golden State. <br />
<br />
We’re continually looking for newer, bigger and better projects that help us create a clean energy future. The more than $1.5 billion we’ve brought to these projects to date not only helps provide renewable energy to the grid and to the public, but as they perform, they allow us to invest in more renewable energy projects. This cycle makes financial sense for Google and our partners while supporting construction jobs in local communities and clean energy for the planet we share.<br />

2039642152029889736,,Google Blogs,2014-09-10T02:00:00-07:00,Walk like an Egyptian with Street View in Google Maps,"Candlelight flickering on a stone wall covered in hieroglyphs. A proud queen brought low by the bite of a snake. Reeds rustling along a river, waiting to be turned into papyrus, or maybe a basket. The civilization of ancient Egypt stood for thousands of years and left behind a rich legacy of architecture, art, medicine, politics, culture and more. Today, it looms large in our imagination as the home of Cleopatra, Ptolemy, Tutankhamun, people who worshipped cats as gods and buried their embalmed dead in tombs filled with treasures and sustenance for the afterlife. <br />
<br />
Now the Egypt of your imagination can be brought to life with new Street View imagery in Google Maps, and you can take a virtual walk among the stunning monuments and rich history of this ancient civilization. <br />
<br />
Start where most tourists do: at the <a href=""http://www.google.com/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/treks/pyramids-of-giza/"">Pyramids of Giza</a>, which rise from the vast expanse of the Sahara like man-made mountains. Just kilometers from the bustling, modern city of Cairo, the Pyramids have stood for nearly 5,000 years, a testament to the ingenuity and ambition of the ancient Egyptian people.<br />

Built as a tomb and a symbol of eternity for the Pharoah Khufu, it stands 139 meters high (the height of the world’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingda_Ka"">highest roller coaster</a>!) and was the tallest man-made structure on Earth for 3,800 years. Look beyond it to the west, and you’ll see the pyramids of <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@29.973885,31.128895,3a,75y,25.42h,90.64t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1sRrzOB7x2X6Fz7l_2SC1H9Q!2e0!3e5"">Khafre</a> and <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@29.973757,31.128072,3a,75y,164.71h,84.67t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1s0xSsoMSVrtwlg791K2LysQ!2e0!3e5"">Menkaure</a>, built by Khufu's son and grandson. <br />

<br />
<b>Heaven is a funny place</b><br />
“I want my funeral to be a huge showbiz affair with lights, cameras, action ... I want Meryl Streep crying, in five different accents.” Those are words from the great comedian <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Joan+Rivers&amp;std=20140904&amp;pn=p1#a=20140904-Joan+Rivers"">Joan Rivers</a>, who passed away yesterday. People across the web commemorated Rivers’ almost 50-year career by reliving her best <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/04/joan-rivers-quotes_n_5730396.html?&amp;ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067"">punchlines and jokes</a> (she was pretty hard to top). Meanwhile, people worked themselves into a panic when rumors swirled that TV’s favorite Golden Girl, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Betty+White&amp;std=20140903&amp;pn=p1#a=20140903-Betty+White"">Betty White</a>, had passed on as well. Thankfully, the Internet is no soothsayer and Betty is alive and kicking—despite what the trends say. <br />
<br />
<b>Tales from the endzone </b><br />
People were eagerly searching for info about the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=NFL&amp;std=20140904&amp;pn=p1#a=20140904-NFL"">NFL</a>’s opening game last night between the Green Bay Packers and reigning champions the Seattle Seahawks. And if you were still frantically finalizing your roster for your fantasy football team this week, you were in good company. Searchers looked for the latest player stats to fine-tune their lineups and were doing so at <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=fantasy%20football&amp;cmpt=q"">higher rates</a> than previous years. One player not on fantasy rosters but on fans’ minds was <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Michael+Sam&amp;std=20140830&amp;pn=p1#a=20140830-Michael+Sam"">Michael Sam</a>, the first openly gay player to be drafted by the NFL, as he was cut from the St. Louis Rams. He ended up finding a home on the Dallas Cowboys practice squad, so we'll have to wait just a little bit longer for him to make history on the field.<br />

<b>She looks great in white (and on TV)</b><br />
Search was singing “The Wedding March” this week as famous brides walked down the aisle—and up the trends charts. <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Angelina+Jolie&amp;std=20140902&amp;pn=p1#a=20140902-Angelina+Jolie"">Angelina Jolie</a> and her wedding dress went where no other woman (except Jennifer Aniston) had gone and tied the knot with Brad Pitt. And we’re guessing <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Jenny+McCarthy&amp;std=20140830&amp;pn=p1#a=20140830-Jenny+McCarthy"">Jenny McCarthy</a>’s got the right stuff since she and former New Kid on the Block singer Donnie Wahlberg decided to get hitched (may they hang tough for years to come). Finally, basketball star Dwayne Wade stepped away from the court and onto the altar to wed <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Gabrielle+Union&amp;std=20140830&amp;pn=p1#a=20140830-Gabrielle+Union"">Gabrielle Union</a>. Bethany Mota celebrated a different kind of milestone as she joined the cast of <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>, becoming the first YouTube star to ever be invited on the show. But not everyone had a happy ending in Hollywood. Hackers were able to break into the phones of several actresses, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Celebrity+Leaked+Photos+2014&amp;std=20140902&amp;pn=p1#a=20140902-Celebrity+Leaked+Photos+2014"">leaking</a> their private photos to the world—and stirring a debate in mainstream culture about privacy and cloud security. <br />
<br />
<b>Oldie but a goodie</b><br />
We now present to you a short interlude down memory lane. This week, the cast of the 1994 hit comedy, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Little+Rascals&amp;std=20140903&amp;pn=p1#a=20140903-Little+Rascals""><i>The Little Rascals</i></a>, reunited to reshoot the <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/cast-rascals-20-years/story?id=25237857"">movie’s iconic poster</a>—we’re still trying to come to terms with the whole “20 year anniversary” thing. And if you grew up in the 90’s, you’re more than familiar with Zack Morris and his antics at Bayside High on the teen sitcom <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Saved+by+the+Bell&amp;std=20140901&amp;pn=p1#a=20140901-Saved+by+the+Bell""><i>Saved by the Bell</i></a>. But do you know what happened when the cameras were turned off? That’s what searchers were looking for when Lifetime’s new TV movie&nbsp;<i>The Unauthorized Saved By The Bell Story</i>&nbsp;aired this past Monday. The movie had a somewhat chilly reception on social media, with people <a href=""https://twitter.com/JillianSed/status/506611486022967296"">tweeting</a> their various issues with its portrayal.<br />
<br />
<b>Tip of the week</b><br />
Summer may officially be over but that doesn’t mean the beach is closed. Just ask Google, “Where is the nearest beach?” to enjoy a little fun in the sun...because you know what they say, winter is coming!<br />

Since then, the first watches powered by Android Wear, the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/LG_G_Watch_Black_Titan?id=lg_g_watch_black&amp;hl=en"">LG G Watch</a> and <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/Samsung_Gear_Live_Black?id=samsung_gear_live_black&amp;hl=en"">Samsung Gear Live</a>, have gone on sale, developers have already built thousands of apps enhanced for Wear, and great new watches are becoming available from more partners.<br />
<br />
Our goal with Wear is to build technology that helps you connect with others and get stuff done. So often, technology can become something that gets in the way of everything else. But we want to build devices that you can use when you need and forget about when you don’t—technology that's built for your sake, rather than its own sake. Coming throughout the rest of this year, we're making some updates to Wear that will help you get even more out of your watch—and the rest of your life, too. <br />
<br />
First, we're bringing <b>offline music playback</b> and <b>GPS support</b> to Android Wear. Go for a run or bike ride with your Android wearable and leave your phone at home. You’ll be able to listen to music stored on your watch via Bluetooth headphones. And if your watch includes a GPS sensor, you can track your distance and speed too. <br />
<br />
The second update will enable <b>downloadable watch faces</b>, so you can customize the visual design of your watch's home screen to show the information you want to see most—like your calendar or fitness sensors. Developers will soon be working on watch faces, making them available on Google Play.<br />
<br />
We’re also continuing to work with manufacturers to bring you even more watch options, with different shapes, styles and sensors.<br />
<ul>
<li>The <a href=""http://moto360.motorola.com/"">Moto 360</a>, the first Android wearable with a round display, is <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/Moto_360_Black_Leather?id=motorola_moto_360_leather_black"">now available for sale</a> in the U.S.</li>
<li>The <a href=""http://www.asus.com/Phones/ASUS_ZenWatch_WI500Q/"">Asus Zen Watch</a>, coming later this year, includes a bio sensor, so you can keep tabs on your fitness and relaxation levels throughout the day.</li>
<li>The <a href=""http://www.lgnewsroom.com/newsroom/contents/64664"">LG G Watch R</a> uses a circular display, includes a heart rate monitor, and will be available later this year.</li>
<li>Last, but not least, we’re happy to welcome Sony to the Android Wear family with the <a href=""http://blogs.sonymobile.com/press_release/sony-wearable-tech-smartwatch-3-smartband-talk/"">Sony SmartWatch 3</a>. It uses a transflective display for easier readability in sunlight, includes a GPS sensor, and will be available later this year.</li>

These watches, as well as those unveiled earlier this summer, will all get the new software updates described above as soon as they’re ready in the coming months. We're also working with our partners on even more improvements, which means your device will continue to get better, with updates provided directly to you.<br />
<br />
Whether it's giving you directions, letting you stay in touch more easily or keeping track of your steps so you can stay fit, Wear is designed to help you out without getting in your way. With new features and many new devices to choose from, chances are there's a watch that's just right for you.<br />

This year, there’s a way for mobile-clutching NFL fans to take their smack talk to the next level. <b>Madden GIFERATOR</b> is a new project created by our <a href=""http://www.artcopycode.com/"">Art, Copy &amp; Code</a> team, in partnership with EA Sports and agencies Heat and Grow, to help launch EA Sports’ signature football game <a href=""http://www.easports.com/madden-nfl"">Madden NFL 15</a>.<br />

During every NFL game, the <a href=""http://www.maddengiferator.com/"">Madden GIFERATOR</a> will create a live stream of memes using <i>Madden NFL 15</i> video game footage (as GIFs), triggered by the action on the field. The GIFs will appear in real time on <a href=""http://maddengiferator.com/"">MaddenGIFERATOR.com</a>, on social media, as well as in ads on popular sports and gaming related apps and sites across the the <a href=""http://www.google.com/ads/displaynetwork/"">Google Display Network</a>. For example, if Seattle’s Richard Sherman picks off Aaron Rodgers tonight, you might see a GIF of Sherman with the headline “Weren’t you supposed to catch that? Aawwwwwkward” in the stream, alongside a real-time update on the score and game clock.<br />
<br />
You can also take control of the GIFERATOR and design your own GIFs, choosing the team, the player, the background and the headline, ready for sharing across the web. <br />
<div style=""text-align: center;"">

The Madden GIFERATOR is the latest in our <a href=""http://www.artcopycode.com/"">Art, Copy &amp; Code series</a>, where we partner with brands and their agencies to create useful and fun experiences, powered by Google technology. We wanted to tap into the growing trend for fans to comment on and interact with games from their phones—plus, we have a <a href=""https://support.google.com/plus/answer/3113884?hl=en"">weakness</a> for GIFs. The GIFERATOR fuses live NFL game data with a database of Madden images, players, backgrounds and headlines to create relevant memes on the fly. <br />
<br />
So this season, when your team delivers those clutch plays, head over to <a href=""http://maddengiferator.com/"">MaddenGIFERATOR.com</a>, choose the perfect image, customize it with your best smack talk, and send it to your fellow fans (if you want to be nice) or your rivals (if you’ve got a wicked streak).

Stay tuned to the <a href=""http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/"">Lat Long blog</a> over the next few days for the rest of the series. </i>—Ed. <br />
<br />
When you head out your door, you’ve got directions in your pocket—whether you’re driving to your aunt’s place in the mountains, cycling to a new biergarten or taking the train downtown. For Google Maps to get you there, it needs to be a digital mirror of the real world. But the real world is always changing. So to make sure your map is an accurate reflection of your world, we started <a href=""http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2012/12/building-better-map-of-europe.html"">Ground Truth</a>, a project that brings the freshest, most relevant information to Google Maps. <br />
<br />
Today, we’ve reached our 50th Ground Truth country with the addition of five new countries: Taiwan, Malaysia, Poland, Romania, and the last regions of Russia. We’re also rolling out <a href=""http://www.google.com/mapmaker"">Google Map Maker</a> and <a href=""https://support.google.com/maps/answer/162873?hl=en"">Report a Problem</a>—our crowdsourcing map tools—to Taiwan, Russia and Malaysia, giving anyone in those locations the ability to share and contribute their local knowledge directly to Google Maps.<br />

<br />
For these countries, that means clearer, more detailed depictions of points of interest like walking paths in parks or department labels in universities, a reworking of the road network with new street names and turn restrictions, and faster updates to the map. In the unique case of Poland and Romania, both of which have Map Maker communities that were instrumental in building the map from scratch, it also means providing more resources to bring the same level of map detail to all regions in these places.<br />

Over the next week, we’re pulling back the curtain to show you how Ground Truth and Map Maker work together to build Google Maps. Much of the magic behind Maps comes from people—from the Googlers who spend hours perfecting every road in the world, to the users who come together to improve the quality of maps in their local communities. To build the map, we have to gather high-quality information; in the next post, we’ll show you what that process looks like—and show off a new mapping technology. Stay tuned to the <a href=""http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/"">Lat Long Blog</a> for more on how Google Maps is made!<br />

6449981414180343362,,Google Blogs,2014-09-02T10:38:00-07:00,Introducing Google for Work (the artist formerly known as Enterprise),"Work is where you spend a lot of your time. So we’ve always believed that it should be meaningful—not a daily grind, done in isolation on an old desktop in a sea of cubicles. Even more, we believe that technology should make work better. It should make it easy not just to get things done, but to get things done with people who inspire you, at the times and in the places where you work best, and in a way that lets you make an impact, no matter what your job is, or what industry you’re in.<br />
<br />
Ten years ago, we started bringing Google’s consumer technology—along with the features, controls and services businesses need—to work. We first brought search and then Gmail to businesses. Today we also offer the scale and reliability of Google’s infrastructure to developers with Google Maps and Google Cloud Platform, and have extended into hardware with Android and Chromebooks. Along the way we’ve invested in what matters to our customers and partners—security, transparency, compliance and customer support. And our team, the breadth of our offerings, and our commitment to business customers have all increased substantially. <br />
<br />
Work today is very different from 10 years ago. Cloud computing, once a new idea, is abundantly available, and collaboration is possible across offices, cities, countries and continents. Ideas can go from prototype to development to launch in a matter of days. Working from a computer, tablet or phone is no longer just a trend—it’s a reality. And millions of companies, large and small, have turned to Google’s products to help them launch, build and transform their businesses, and help their employees work the way they live. In other words, work is already better than it used to be. <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/bTFPSQ7Q0zw"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
But technology for the workplace isn't just about a better way of doing business. It's about empowering anyone, whether they're a developer with an idea in their basement or a baker with a better cupcake or a company with thousands of employees, to have an impact. We never set out to create a traditional “enterprise” business—we wanted to create a new way of doing work. So the time has come for our name to catch up with our ambition. As of today, what was called Google Enterprise is now, simply, Google for Work. When we use the tools that make our lives easier—<a href=""http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/"">Google Apps</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/enterprise/mapsearth/"">Maps</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/enterprise/search/"">Search</a>, <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/business/browser/"">Chrome</a>, <a href=""http://www.android.com/"">Android</a>, <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/"">Cloud Platform</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/enterprise/solutions.html"">more</a>—work gets better. And that’s what we’re working on—<a href=""http://www.google.com/enterprise/index.html?utm_campaign=entblog-GFW&amp;utm_source=IntroducingGoogleforWork09022014&amp;utm_medium=blog"">the best of Google, now for work</a>.<br />

<b>And the Emmy goes to…</b><br />
Though <i>Breaking Bad</i> took home the top honors at Monday’s Emmy Awards, people searched less for the acclaimed drama than for some of the event’s other, more unexpected happenings. <i>American Horror Story</i>’s <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Jessica+Lange&amp;std=20140825&amp;pn=p1#a=20140825-Jessica+Lange"">Jessica Lange</a> proved she’s still got it—she was the top search of the night.

And it was a night of funny women:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Julia+Louis-Dreyfus&amp;std=20140825&amp;pn=p1#a=20140825-Julia+Louis-Dreyfus"">Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a> did justice to her award for best actress in a comedy with a <i>Seinfeld</i>-inspired bit on stage… and a <i>Seinfeld</i>-throwback kiss just offstage; and <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Sarah+Silverman&amp;std=20140825&amp;pn=p1#a=20140825-Sarah+Silverman"">Sarah Silverman</a> won an award for best variety special (and showed off some <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/gossip/la-et-mg-sarah-silverman-pot-vape-pen-emmy-awards-red-carpet-20140826-story.html"">unusual accessories</a>). Other popular Emmys searches included HBO’s <i><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=The+Normal+Heart&amp;std=20140825&amp;pn=p1#a=20140825-The+Normal+Heart"">The Normal Heart</a>,</i>&nbsp;which was nominated for 16 awards and won two, and <i><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=True+Detective&amp;std=20140825&amp;pn=p1#a=20140825-True+Detective"">True Detective</a></i>, which won for directing but did not capture the acting awards some expected. <br />

<b>Tip of the week</b><br />
Don’t let delays ruin your long weekend. To help you decide whether it’s faster to bike or take transit to your Labor Day destination, Google Search can show you all of your transportation options and estimated travel times on a single card.

<br />
<b>Tragedies and scandals</b><br />
The world was shocked by a video showing the execution of American journalist <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=James+Foley&amp;std=20140819&amp;pn=p1#a=20140819-James+Foley"">James Foley</a> by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Questions remain about how the United States will respond to the incident. And there was sad news closer to home too. TV lost an icon when <i>Saturday Night Live’s</i> announcer of 40+ years, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Don+Pardo&amp;std=20140819&amp;pn=p1#a=20140819-Don+Pardo"">Don Pardo</a>, passed away at 96.<br />
<br />
While some searchers were in mourning, others were looking for answers. Texas Governor and potential GOP presidential candidate <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Rick+Perry&amp;std=20140819&amp;pn=p1#a=20140819-Rick+Perry"">Rick Perry</a> was indicted this week on charges of abuse of power. Perry pleaded not guilty to all charges, but that didn’t stop searchers from investigating. And while people had their detective hats on, they also looked into the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Louisville+Purge&amp;std=20140815&amp;pn=p1#a=20140815-Louisville+Purge"">Louisville Purge</a>, a social media hoax based off the horror movie series <i>The Purge</i>.

<b>“J” as in “J is the only letter that matters”</b><br />
You’d think our favorite letter would be the letter “G,” and normally that’s the case—but not this week as J-named celebrities jacked the trends charts. Two-time <i>Dancing with the Stars</i> champion Julianna Hough is taking off her dancing shoes and getting comfortable behind the judge’s table in a new role on the show. Meanwhile, rumors flew like mockingjays this week that actress <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Jennifer+Lawrence&amp;std=20140815&amp;pn=p1#a=20140815-Jennifer+Lawrence"">Jennifer Lawrence</a> has a new beau— the consciously uncoupled Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.

Searchers were baffled this week when Johnny Football decided to show the Washington bench that he, um, was “number one.”<br />
<br />
<b>Deep sea video gaming</b><br />
Searchers took a trip down memory lane when former James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan went head-to-head with Jimmy Fallon in the classic Nintendo 64 game “GoldenEye 007.” Unfortunately, Brosnan’s experience as the untouchable Bond didn’t quite translate into video games skills. But Bond wasn’t the only one sleeping with the fishes. There were rough waters this week for sharks... more specifically <a href=""http://www.weather.com/news/science/nature/goliath-grouper-devours-shark-one-big-bite-video-20140821"">this shark</a>, who was swallowed whole in one bite by a <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Goliath+Grouper&amp;std=20140820&amp;pn=p1#a=20140820-Goliath+Grouper"">goliath Grouper</a>.

Legions of fans searched for every one of their favorite films from Williams’ decades-long career; top topics include <i><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Hook&amp;std=20140811&amp;pn=p1#a=20140811-Hook"">Hook</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Jumanji&amp;std=20140811&amp;pn=p1#a=20140811-Jumanji"">Jumanji</a> </i>and<i> <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Good+Morning+Vietnam&amp;std=20140811&amp;pn=p1#a=20140811-Good+Morning+Vietnam"">Good Morning Vietnam</a></i>. Many were looking up his most memorable quotes and roles, including the “O captain, my captain” monologue in <i>Dead Poets Society</i>, Genie’s first scene in <i>Aladdin</i>, and a standup bit about golf. Others searched for tributes by Williams’ fellow actors and comedians, like <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Jimmy+Fallon+Robin+Williams&amp;std=20140812&amp;pn=p1#a=20140812-Jimmy+Fallon+Robin+Williams"">Jimmy Fallon</a> and Conan O’Brien. And just yesterday, news that the actor had been diagnosed with <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Parkinson+Disease&amp;std=20140814&amp;pn=p1#a=20140814-Parkinson+Disease"">Parkinson’s disease</a> led people to the web once again.<br />
<br />
Two days after Williams’ death, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Lauren+Bacall&amp;std=20140812&amp;pn=p1#a=20140812-Lauren+Bacall"">Lauren Bacall</a> passed away at the age of 89, inspiring people to search for more information on the actress, in particular her marriage to Humphrey Bogart back in Hollywood’s golden age.<br />

<b>Unrest in Missouri</b><br />
Protests ignited in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri this weekend after an unarmed teenager named <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Mike+Brown&amp;std=20140810&amp;pn=p1#a=20140810-Mike+Brown"">Mike Brown</a> was shot and killed by police on Saturday. People turned to search to learn more about the conflict, and searches for terms like [ferguson riot] and [ferguson shooting] rose by more than 1,000%.<br />

<b>Math and science phenomena</b><br />
Maryam Mirzakhani, a professor of mathematics at Stanford, was awarded the 2014 Fields Medal this week for her work on understanding the symmetry of curved surfaces such as spheres. She is the first woman and first Iranian to win the prize, considered the Nobel Prize of mathematics. <br />
<br />
Turning from one sphere to a celestial one, two astronomical events led searchers to the web to learn more. The <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Meteor+Shower&amp;std=20140810&amp;pn=p1#a=20140810-Meteor+Shower"">Perseid meteor shower</a> had its annual peak this week—and got a <a href=""https://twitter.com/google/status/498873020128051200"">doodle</a> for the occasion—and the brightest <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=super+moon&amp;std=20140809&amp;pn=p1#a=20140809-super+moon"">super moon</a> of the year had everyone a little lun-y. <br />

From Martha Stewart to Justin Timberlake to your college roommate, odds are you know someone who’s dumped a bucket of icy water on themselves for the cause. The ALS Association has received millions of dollars in donations as a result, though we don’t have any numbers on how many brave folks took the plunge. <br />

<b>Trouble in paradise</b><br />
Would you turn down a free trip to Hawaii? Julio and Iselle aren’t. The <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Hawaii+Hurricane&amp;std=20140806&amp;pn=p1#a=20140806-Hawaii+Hurricane"">two hurricanes</a> are barreling towards the islands, bringing 90 mph winds, flash floods and hordes of searches with them. If Iselle makes landfall, she’ll be the first hurricane to hit the Big Island since 1950. Julio, like the tag-a-long younger brother, is right on Iselle’s tail. You can review tips on how to stay safe during hurricane season <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+google/posts/iGz3bdgEEtv"">here</a>.<br />
<br />
A Hawaiian hurricane isn’t the only trouble brewing in the air. Searchers had a virtual panic attack when Facebook <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Facebook+down&amp;std=20140801&amp;pn=p1#a=20140801-Facebook+down"">went down</a> for a couple hours last Friday. In a state of shock, some people even <a href=""http://time.com/3071049/facebook-down-police/"">called the police</a> to assist with their social media emergency. Meanwhile, a toxin called <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=microcystin&amp;std=20140802&amp;pn=p1#a=20140802-microcystin"">microcystin</a> is contaminating the waters in parts of Ohio, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to stockpile bottled water and look for answers on the Internet. <br />
<br />
But there’s only one thing that can distract us from the craziness of real life… and that’s the sheer absurdity of reality TV. Viewers and searchers tuned in to watch the premiere of the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Bachelor+in+Paradise&amp;std=20140804&amp;pn=p1#a=20140804-Bachelor+in+Paradise""><i>Bachelor in Paradise</i></a>, an elimination-style show where contestants compete for love. This is probably not what Cervantes meant when he wrote that all's fair in love and war. <br />

<b>First let me take a selfie</b><br />
As if the world couldn’t get any more litigious, a British photographer is taking on Wikimedia over a selfie—and not just any selfie, a monkey selfie. After a curious crested black macaque came upon David Slater’s camera equipment and fulfilled nature’s call by taking a <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/photographer-wikipedia-copyright-fight-viral-monkey-selfie-picture-article-1.1895459#OQXbRsICeM3oqQah.97"">selfie</a>, the photo went viral and was eventually uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, an online repository of free to use images, sound, and other media. Slater asked Wikimedia to take it down on copyright infringement grounds, and Wikimedia said no. Their argument: the photo wasn’t Slater’s work -- it was the monkey’s. We’ll leave it up to you to decide who you think is right.  <br />
<br />
Fortunately, at least one dispute this week was resolved: The stars of the hit science geek themed show, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Big+Bang+Theory&amp;std=20140804&amp;pn=p1#a=20140804-Big+Bang+Theory""><i>The Big Bang Theory</i></a>, signed new contracts that would pay them $1 million per episode. We’re betting that somehow the line “Show me the Money” is going to make it into the script. A real-life scientist also managed to crack the trends charts when our <a href=""http://www.google.com/doodles/john-venns-180th-birthday"">doodle</a> celebrating <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=John+Venn&amp;std=20140803&amp;pn=p1#a=20140803-John+Venn"">John Venn</a>, the creator of the Venn Diagram, got searchers excited to discover what the intersections between sea-life and something with wings. <br />

<b>Who runs the world? Girls!</b><br />
Let’s be honest, can anyone really get enough Beyonce in their life? Her “On the Run” tour with that other mildly successful artist/mogul just topped <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2014/08/06/jay-z-and-beyonces-ticket-sales-top-100-million-as-tour-winds-down/"">$100 million</a> in ticket sales and now the remix of her song “<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Flawless+Remix&amp;std=20140803&amp;pn=p1#a=20140803-Flawless+Remix"">Flawless</a>” featuring Nicki Minaj is getting searchers into a frenzy. This woman can do no wrong (except <a href=""http://blog.muchmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/beyoncepizza.jpg"">maybe</a>). <br />
<br />
Beyonce may cast a shadow that dwarfs us all, but two other women are holding their own on the search charts. WBNA star <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Becky+Hammon&amp;std=20140805&amp;pn=p1#a=20140805-Becky+Hammon"">Becky Hammon</a> became the NBA’s first female assistant coach when she joined the staff of the San Antonio Spurs. (We’ll call that a crack in the glass backboard.) And First Daughter Malia Obama nearly stole the show at <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Lollapalooza&amp;std=20140801&amp;pn=p1#a=20140801-Lollapalooza"">Lollapalooza</a> following her appearance among fellow festival-goers in Chicago. <br />

6241074713816526020,,Google Blogs,2014-08-05T08:59:00-07:00,A first step toward more global email,"<i>Cross-posted on the <a href=""https://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/a-first-step-toward-more-global-email.html"">Official Gmail Blog</a></i><br />
<br />
Whether your email address is firstname.lastname@ or something more expressive like corgicrazy@, an email address says something about who you are. But from the start, email addresses have always required you to use non-accented Latin characters when signing up. Less than half of the world’s population has a mother tongue that uses the Latin alphabet. And even fewer people use only the letters A-Z. So if your name (or that of your favorite pet) contains accented characters (like “José Ramón”) or is written in another script like Chinese or Devanagari, your email address options are limited. <br />
<br />
But all that could change. In 2012, an organization called the <a href=""https://www.ietf.org/"">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a> created a new email <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6530"">standard</a> that supports addresses with non-Latin and accented Latin characters (e.g. 武＠メール.グーグル). In order for this standard to become a reality, every email provider and every website that asks you for your email address must adopt it. That’s obviously a tough hill to climb. The technology is there, but someone has to take the first step.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

Today we're ready to be that someone. Starting now, Gmail (and shortly, Calendar) will recognize addresses that contain accented or non-Latin characters. This means Gmail users can send emails to, and receive emails from, people who have these characters in their email addresses. Of course, this is just a first step and there’s still a ways to go. In the future, we want to make it possible for you to use them to create Gmail accounts.<br />
<br />
Last month, we announced&nbsp;<a href=""http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/07/thirteen-new-languages-for-gmail_7.html"">the addition of 13 new languages</a> in Gmail. Language should never be a barrier when it comes to connecting with others and with this step forward, truly global email is now even closer to becoming a reality.<br />

<b>Searchnado</b><br />
Thanks in large part to nerdfest Comic-Con, it was a week of sneak peeks for movie fans. First up: the reboot of <i><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Mad+Max&amp;std=20140727&amp;pn=p1#a=20140727-Mad+Max"">Mad Max</a>.</i> The long-awaited remake of the Australian classic premiered its trailer at the conference last weekend, and fans got their first real glimpse of <strike>Bane</strike> Tom Hardy as Max. Meanwhile, a sneak peek of Israeli actress <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Gal+Gadot&amp;std=20140726&amp;pn=p1#a=20140726-Gal+Gadot"">Gal Gadot</a> as Wonder Woman in the forthcoming<i> Batman v.

And a new teaser trailer for <i><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Mockingjay+Trailer&amp;std=20140728&amp;pn=p1#a=20140728-Mockingjay+Trailer"">Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1</a></i> gave us a new glimpse at Katniss as the face of the rebellion.<br />
<br />
Though neither film will be in theaters for some time, fans are keeping busy in the meantime: searches for new releases <i><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Guardians+of+the+Galaxy&amp;std=20140731&amp;pn=p1#a=20140731-Guardians+of+the+Galaxy"">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Lucy&amp;std=20140725&amp;pn=p1#a=20140725-Lucy"">Lucy</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Hercules+movie&amp;std=20140725&amp;pn=p1#a=20140725-Hercules+movie"">Hercules</a></i> were all high on the charts.

<b>Tip of the week</b><br />
Next time you’re invited to a summer barbecue, let Google help you remember to pick up a snack or six-pack to contribute to the fiesta. On your <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&amp;hl=en"">Android</a> or <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-search/id284815942?mt=8"">iPhone</a>, just say “Ok Google, remind me to buy a watermelon when I’m at Safeway.” Next time you’re near the store, you’ll get a prompt. No more showing up with empty hands!<br />

Could be worse. Here’s a look at what people were searching for last week:<br />
<br />
<b>Fifty shades of search</b><br />
Searchers were “Crazy in Love” with the new trailer for <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=50+Shades+of+Grey&amp;std=20140724&amp;pn=p1#a=20140724-50+Shades+of+Grey""><i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i></a>, set to a special Beyonce recording of her 2003 hit. There were more than a million searches this week for the ….ahem… hotly anticipated movie, which comes out next Valentine’s Day. In addition to the trailer, people were also looking for information on <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=50%20shades%20of%20grey&amp;date=today%201-m&amp;cmpt=q"">stars</a> [jamie dornan] and [dakota johnson]. Beyonce was in the spotlight for other reasons too, following rumors that her marriage to Jay-Z was on the rocks.<br />

<b>“Mandatory” and musical marriages</b><br />
After three decades in the biz, Weird Al has finally made his way into the Billboard No. 1 spot with his latest album, “Mandatory Fun.” Though his shtick hasn’t changed, when it comes to promoting his parodies, the artist has adapted to the Internet era, releasing eight new videos in as many days to generate buzz—and <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=weird%20al&amp;date=1%2F2014%2012m%2C%201%2F2013%2012m%2C%201%2F2012%2012m%2C%201%2F2011%2012m%2C%201%2F2010%2012m&amp;cmpt=date"">more search volume</a> than at any other point in the past five years. As an editor, of course, I’m partial to “Word Crimes” (which has more than 10 million views on YouTube), but it’s just <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=weird%20al&amp;date=today%201-m&amp;cmpt=q"">one of the many “breakout” titles</a> searchers are looking for, along with [tacky], [foil] and [first world problems].<br />
<br />
In other musical news, Adam Levine’s bride [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Behati+Prinsloo&amp;std=20140719&amp;pn=p1#a=20140719-Behati+Prinsloo"">behati prinsloo</a>] was trending this week after the two got married in Cabo San Lucas. And another Mexico wedding had people searching for information on [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Ryan+Dorsey&amp;std=20140723&amp;pn=p1#a=20140723-Ryan+Dorsey"">ryan dorsey</a>], the new husband (after a surprise ceremony) of <i>Glee</i> star Naya Rivera. <br />
<br />
<b>Foodie ups and downs</b><br />
A national fruit recall at stores like Costco and Whole Foods led people to the web to learn more about [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Listeria&amp;std=20140721&amp;pn=p1#a=20140721-Listeria"">listeria</a>]. For many, the possible contamination may have been an extra incentive to celebrate several less than healthful food holidays: Last Sunday (or should we say sundae?) marked National Ice Cream Day, and people were <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=National+Ice+Cream+Day&amp;std=20140720&amp;pn=p1#a=20140720-National+Ice+Cream+Day"">searching</a> for their favorite flavor. National Hot Dog Day took place just a few days later, though sausage searches <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=national%20hot%20dog%20day%2C%20national%20ice%20cream%20day%2C%20national%20tequila%20day&amp;date=today%203-m&amp;cmpt=q"">paled in comparison</a>. And just in case all that junk food made you thirsty, yesterday’s <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=National+Tequila+Day&amp;std=20140724&amp;pn=p1#a=20140724-National+Tequila+Day"">National Tequila Day</a> had searchers looking for the perfect margarita recipe. <br />

<br />
Seriously.<br />
<br />
Of course, there’s more to it than that. Especially when the big box is a power inverter, a <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=picnic+cooler&amp;oq=picnic+cooler&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1615j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=cooler&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=shop&amp;spd=1177368560092090179"">picnic cooler-sized</a> device used to convert the energy that comes from solar, electric vehicles &amp; wind (DC power) into something you can use in your home (AC power). We want to shrink it down to the size of a small laptop, roughly 1/10th of its current size. Put a little more technically, we’re looking for someone to build a kW-scale inverter with a power density greater than 50W per cubic inch. Do it best and we’ll give you a million bucks.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

There will be obstacles to overcome (like the conventional wisdom of engineering). But whoever gets it done will help change the future of electricity. A smaller inverter could help create low-cost microgrids in remote parts of the world. Or allow you to keep the lights on during a blackout via your electric car’s battery. Or enable advances we haven’t even thought of yet.<br />
<br />
Either way, we think it’s time to shine a light on the humble inverter, and the potential that lies in making it much, much smaller. Enter at <a href=""https://www.littleboxchallenge.com/"">littleboxchallenge.com</a>—we want to know how small you can go.<br />

For many, it’s pretty simple: the Internet. The web is helping businesses and communities across the U.S. to grow and succeed. In fact, last year Google’s search and advertising tools helped provide $111 billion of economic activity for more than 1.5 million businesses—advertisers, publishers and nonprofits—across the U.S.<br />
<br />
Take <a href=""http://www.go2marine.com/"">Go2marine</a>, a boat supply company located on Bainbridge Island, off the coast of Washington State. Because of their remote location, bringing traffic to their website using <a href=""http://www.google.com/adwords"">Google AdWords</a> plays an important role in their ability to sell their 250,000+ boat supplies to customers in 176 countries. When it’s winter in the U.S., they rely on customers located in other parts of the world where it’s boating season, with the web bringing them business from any place, in any season.<br />

Or meet Don Morton, who taught reading, writing and language in lower-income neighborhoods in my home town of Chicago for nine years. In 2005, he began creating his own materials to supplement what the school system provided. Realizing that his worksheets could be useful for students and teachers everywhere, he created <a href=""http://ereadingworksheets.com/"">ereadingworksheets.com</a> to provide his worksheets for free. Don started using <a href=""http://www.google.com/adsense"">Google AdSense</a> to offset his costs by placing ads next to his content, and today he’s able to work full-time on his website and make an impact on students around the world. <br />
<br />
These are just two examples of enterprising people making the most of Google tools to find new customers, connect with existing ones and grow their businesses; you can find plenty more of them in our <a href=""http://www.google.com/economicimpact"">Economic Impact Report</a>. Our tools help connect business owners to their customers, whether they’re around the corner or across the world from each other. And when businesses flourish, it’s good news for the rest of us. Recent data shows that businesses that are online are expected to grow 40 percent faster and hire twice as many workers as businesses that aren’t. Every year, it gets clearer that the web helps lead to more successful businesses, stronger economies, more vibrant towns, and more prosperous communities. <br />

Here’s a look at some more top trends in search this week, from the Quidditch World Cup to the world’s highest-valued potato salad:<br />
<br />
<b>A literary thrill</b><br />
Author J.K. Rowling was in the news this week after she posted a new <i>Harry Potter</i> story to the fan site Pottermore.com. There were <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Pottermore&amp;std=20140708&amp;pn=p1#a=20140708-Pottermore"">more than 200,000 searches</a> for the site itself (an increase of more than 100 percent over 30 days), as people speculated about whether the new tale signified the coming of more stories about Harry, Hermione and the rest of Dumbledore’s Army. Meanwhile, people turned to search to find the new trailer for another, very different book-turned-movie: the twisty, turny <i>Gone Girl</i>. Searches for [gone girl trailer] have nearly doubled in the last month.<br />

The Internet experienced a collective shock on Wednesday when news emerged that beloved actor/<a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/ryan-gosling"">meme</a> Ryan Gosling and girlfriend [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Eva+Mendes&amp;std=20140709&amp;pn=p1#a=20140709-Eva+Mendes"">eva mendes</a>] are expecting. (With apologies to <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/06/through-google-lens-search-trends-june.html"">Mila Kunis</a>.) Hundreds of thousands of people turned to search <strike>in denial</strike>, determined to find out the truth. Oddly enough, the phrase [ryan gosling father] had already <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=ryan%20gosling&amp;date=today%201-m&amp;cmpt=q"">spiked</a> in June, after a recent Father’s Day hoax that claimed the Gos had previously adopted a child. And there’s no doubt that many were fervently hoping this, too, was merely a rumor and that they still had a chance with His “Hey Girl”-ness. Disappointed fans will have to console themselves by (re)watching <i>The Notebook</i>, which recently celebrated its 10th anniversary, and generated <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Rachel+McAdams&amp;std=20140702&amp;pn=p1#a=20140702-Rachel+McAdams"">a few searches of its own</a>. Oh, and congratulations to Ms. Mendes, too. <br />
<br />
<b>Summer snack time</b><br />
Finally, during a week of Fourth of July barbecues, it’s only fitting that there was an unusual number of food-related subjects among this week’s trending topics, starting with a picnic table classic. Last week, a fellow named Zach Danger Brown set up a [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Kickstarter&amp;std=20140707&amp;pn=p1#a=20140707-Kickstarter"">kickstarter</a>] project to raise funds for… potato salad. Literally. Despite some controversy over its merits, fundraising for Zach’s project is now $45,326—and counting—past the original $10 goal, and <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=potato%20salad&amp;date=today%201-m&amp;cmpt=q"">searches for potato salad</a> were nearly as high on Tuesday as on Independence Day itself. But that’s nothing compared to another Kickstarter project focused on a summer staple. With more than $1.5 million raised so far, the [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Coolest+Cooler&amp;std=20140709&amp;pn=p1#a=20140709-Coolest+Cooler"">coolest cooler</a>] promises not just to keep your drinks chilled (elementary, my dear Coleman), but also offers a bevy of bells and whistles worthy of “Pimp My Ride.” Not only have 50,000+ searches been done on the subject, but the campaign is well on its way to Kickstarter records. Finally, [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Joey+Chestnut&amp;std=20140704&amp;pn=p1#a=20140704-Joey+Chestnut"">joey chestnut</a>] won hearts as well as the mustard winner’s belt at this year’s Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest at Coney Island when he proposed to his girlfriend at the event.

We're republishing the op-ed in full below. </i>-Ed.<br />
<br />
When you search online, there’s an unwritten assumption that you’ll get an instant answer, as well as additional information if you need to dig deeper.  This is all possible because of two decades worth of investment and innovation by many different companies.  Today, however, search engines across Europe face a new challenge—one we’ve had just two months to get our heads around.  That challenge is figuring out what information we must deliberately <i>omit</i> from our results, following a new ruling from the European Court of Justice.  <br />
<br />
In the past we’ve restricted the removals we make from search to a very short list.  It includes information deemed illegal by a court, such as defamation, pirated content (once we’re notified by the rights holder), malware, personal information such as bank details, child sexual abuse imagery and other things prohibited by local law (like material that glorifies Nazism in Germany).  <br />
<br />
We’ve taken this approach because, as article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:  <i>“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.""</i><br />
<br />
But the European Court found that people have the right to ask for information to be removed from search results that include their names if it is “<i>inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive.</i>” In deciding what to remove, search engines must also have regard to the public interest. These are, of course, very vague and subjective tests.  The court also decided that search engines don’t qualify for a “journalistic exception.” This means that <i>The Guardian</i> could have an article on its website about an individual that’s perfectly legal, but we might not legally be able to show links to it in our results when you search for that person’s name.  It’s a bit like saying the book can stay in the library, it just cannot be included in the library’s card catalogue.   <br />
<br />
It’s for these reasons that we disagree with the ruling.  That said, we obviously respect the court’s authority and are doing our very best to comply quickly and responsibly.  It’s a huge task as we’ve had over 70,000 take-down requests covering 250,000 webpages since May.  So we now have a team of people individually reviewing each application, in most cases with limited information and almost no context.  <br />
<br />
The examples we’ve seen so far highlight the difficult value judgments search engines and European society now face:  former politicians wanting posts removed that criticize their policies in office; serious, violent criminals asking for articles about their crimes to be deleted; bad reviews for professionals like architects and teachers; comments that people have written themselves (and now regret).  In each case, someone wants the information hidden, while others might argue it should be out in the open. <br />
<br />
When it comes to determining what’s in the the public interest, we’re taking into account a number of factors.  These include whether:  the information relates to a politician, celebrity, or other public figure; if the material comes from a reputable news source, and how recent it is; whether it involves political speech; questions of professional conduct that might be relevant to consumers; the involvement of criminal convictions that are not yet “spent”; and if the information is being published by a government.  But these will always be difficult and debatable judgments. <br />
<br />
We’re also doing our best to be transparent about removals: for example, we’re informing websites when one of their pages has been removed.  But we cannot be specific about why we have removed the information because that could violate the individual’s privacy rights under the court's decision.  <br />
<br />
Of course, only two months in, our process is still very much a work in progress.  It’s why we incorrectly removed links to some articles last week (they have since been reinstated).  But the good news is that the ongoing, active debate that’s happening will inform the development of our principles, policies and practices—in particular about how to balance one person’s right to privacy with another’s right to know. <br />
<br />
That’s why we've also set up an <a href=""http://www.google.com/advisorycouncil"">advisory council</a> of experts, the final membership of which we're announcing today. These external experts from the worlds of academia, the media, data protection, civil society and the tech sector are serving as independent advisors to Google.  The council will be asking for evidence and recommendations from different groups, and will hold public meetings this autumn across Europe to examine these issues more deeply.  Its public report will include recommendations for particularly difficult removal requests (like criminal convictions); thoughts on the implications of the court’s decision for European Internet users, news publishers, search engines and others; and procedural steps that could improve accountability and transparency for websites and citizens.<br />
<br />
The issues here at stake are important and difficult, but we’re committed to complying with the court’s decision. Indeed it's hard not to empathize with some of the requests we've seen—from the man who asked that we not show a news article saying he had been questioned in connection with a crime (he’s able to demonstrate that he was never charged) to the mother who requested that we remove news articles for her daughter’s name as she had been the victim of abuse.  It’s a complex issue, with no easy answers.   So a robust debate is both welcome and necessary, as, on this issue at least, no search engine has an instant or perfect answer.<br />

This year, there’s <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/"">Google Cloud Platform</a>. For the past couple weeks, we’ve been using Cloud Platform to make predictions for the World Cup—analyzing data, building a statistical model and using machine learning to predict outcomes of each match since the group round. So far, we’ve gotten 13 out of 14 games correct. But with the finals ahead this weekend, we’re not only ready to make our prediction, but we’re doing something a little extra for you data geeks out there. We’re giving you the keys to our prediction model so you can make your own model and run your own predictions. <br />
<br />
<b>A little background</b><br />
Using data from <a href=""http://www.optasports.com/"">Opta</a> covering multiple seasons of professional soccer leagues as well as the group stage of the World Cup, we were able to examine how activity in previous games predicted performance in subsequent ones. We combined this modeling with a power ranking of relative team strength developed by one of our engineers, as well as a metric to stand in for hometeam advantage based on fan enthusiasm and the number of fans who had traveled to Brazil. We used a whole bunch of Google Cloud Platform products to build this model, including <a href=""http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2014/06/sneak-peek-google-cloud-dataflow-a-cloud-native-data-processing-service.html"">Google Cloud Dataflow</a> to import all the data and <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/products/bigquery"">Google BigQuery</a> to analyze it. So far, we’ve only been wrong on one match (we underestimated Germany when they faced France in the quarterfinals). <br />
<br />
Watch <a class=""g-profile"" href=""https://plus.google.com/115600841849663767233"" target=""_blank"">+Jordan Tigani</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""https://twitter.com/felipehoffa"">Felipe Hoffa</a> from the BigQuery team talk about the project in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyvvxFeADh8"">this video from Google I/O</a>, or look at our <a href=""http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2014/07/google-cloud-platform-goes-8-for-8-in-soccer-predictions.html"">quarterfinals</a> and <a href=""http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2014/07/google-cloud-platform-is-11-for-12-in-World-Cup-predictions.html"">semifinals</a> blog posts to learn more. <br />
<br />
<b>A narrow win for Germany in the final</b><br />
Drumroll please… Though we think it’s going to be close, Germany has the edge: our model gives them a 55 percent chance of defeating Argentina. Both teams have had excellent tournaments so far, but the model favors Germany for a number of factors. Thus far in the tournament, they’ve had better passing in the attacking half of their field, a higher number of shots (64 vs. 61) and a higher number of goals scored (17 vs. 8). <br />
<br />
(Oh, and we think Brazil has a tiny advantage in the third place game. They may have had a disappointing defeat on Tuesday, but their numbers still look good.)<br />
<br />
<b>Channel your inner data nerd</b><br />
Now it’s your turn. We’ve put together a step-by-step guide (warning: code ahead) showing how we built our model and used it for predictions. You could try different statistical techniques or adding in your own data, like player salaries or team travel distance. Even though we’ve been right 92.86 percent of the time, we’re sure there’s room for improvement. <br />
<br />
The model works for other hypothetical situations, and it includes data going back to the 2006 World Cup, three years of English Barclays Premier League, two seasons of Spanish La Liga, and two seasons of U.S. MLS. So, you could try modeling how the USA would have done against Argentina if their game against Belgium had gone differently, or pit this year’s German team against the unstoppable Spanish team of 2010. The world (er, dataset) is your oyster.<br />

This year, we doubled GoogleServe from one to two weeks so we could involve more volunteers and serve more community organizations. And it paid off—more than 12,000 Googlers from 70+ offices participated in 800+ projects, making this our biggest GoogleServe to date. Here’s a look at how we gave back to our communities this year:<br />
<br />
<b>Making tech more accessible</b><br />
At our Mountain View headquarters and in Hyderabad, India, Googlers volunteered in three <a href=""http://www.socialcoding4good.org/"">SocialCoding4Good</a> events. Googlers participated in an Accessibility Code Sprint with <a href=""http://benetech.org/"">Benetech's Global Literacy Program</a> to improve <a href=""http://goread.org/"">Go Read</a>, a free mobile app for people with visual impairments and reading disabilities. A team of Googlers also worked with <a href=""https://www.bookshare.org/"">Bookshare</a> to write descriptions for nearly 1,400 images in five STEM textbooks, making charts, graphs, and diagrams more accessible to blind and visually impaired students.  <br />
<br />
<b>Helping veterans build their resumes </b><br />
Googlers helped 475 veterans build their resumes as part of our “Help a Hero Get Hired” workshops in 14 cities: Ann Arbor, Atlanta, Austin, Boulder, Cambridge, Chicago, Kansas City, Moncks Corner, Mountain View, New York City, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. This was our fourth year partnering with <a href=""http://www.studentveterans.org/"">Student Veterans of America</a> to help veterans take the next steps in their careers.<br />
<br />
<b>Volunteering at local schools and community centers</b><br />
In Oakland, volunteers canvassed the community with <a href=""http://www.hackthehood.org/"">Hack the Hood</a>, a <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/06/meet-bay-area-impact-challenge-winners.html"">Bay Area Impact Challenge winner</a> that trains youth from Oakland's low-income communities to build mobile-friendly websites. In San Francisco, Googlers visited the <a href=""http://www.ymcasf.org/presidio/"">Presidio YMCA</a>, where they repaired picnic tables, cleaned toys and organized closets, and worked with the YMCA’s marketing specialists to redesign their corporate partnerships materials. In Kampala, Uganda, Googlers painted a nursery at <a href=""http://www.sanyubabies.com/"">Sanyu Babies’ Home</a>, helping brighten the living space of the Home’s young residents.<br />
<br />
<b>Building houses and preparing meals</b><br />
Googlers in Mexico City, Buenos Aires and Valparaiso, Chile, partnered with <a href=""http://www.techo.org/en/"">Techo</a> to build houses for low-income families, while volunteers in Singapore prepared, cooked, and distributed 3,000 meals at <a href=""http://www.willinghearts.org.sg/"">Willing Hearts Soup Kitchen</a>. In Milan and Mountain View, Googlers packaged 16,500 meals with <a href=""http://www.stophungernow.org/"">Stop Hunger Now</a>, a nonprofit that ships food to schools, orphanages and clinics in more than 70 countries.<br />
<br />
<b>Protecting the environment </b><br />
A group of Googlers in Auckland, New Zealand, cleared three kilometers of coastline at <a href=""http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/parksfacilities/walkingtracks/Pages/tahunatoreawalkingtrails.aspx"">Tahuna Torea Nature Reserve</a>, and Ann Arbor Googlers collected trash as they paddled down the Huron River with the <a href=""http://www.hrwc.org/"">Huron River Watershed Council</a>.

These marvels from the past still influence our lives today, and are tangible examples of how fearless exploration and entrepreneurship can literally change the world. <br />
<br />
To help support the next generation of European entrepreneurs, today <a href=""http://www.gv.com/"">Google Ventures</a> is launching a new venture fund, with initial funding of $100 million. Our goal is simple: we want to invest in the best ideas from the best European entrepreneurs, and help them bring those ideas to life.  <br />
<br />
When we <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/googles-newest-venture.html"">launched</a> Google Ventures in 2009, we set out to be a very different type of venture fund. Startups need more than just capital to succeed: they also benefit from engineering support, design expertise, and guidance with recruiting, marketing and product management. Five years later, we’re working with <a href=""https://www.gv.com/portfolio/"">more than 250 portfolio companies</a>, tackling challenges across a host of industries. For example, the team at <a href=""http://www.flatiron.com/"">Flatiron Health</a> is improving the way doctors and patients approach cancer care, <a href=""http://www.synapdx.com/"">SynapDx</a> is developing a blood test for the early detection of Autism in children, and <a href=""http://www.cleanpowerfinance.com/"">Clean Power Finance</a> is making solar energy affordable for homeowners. <br />
<br />
We believe Europe’s startup scene has enormous potential. We’ve seen compelling new companies emerge from places like London, Paris, Berlin, the Nordic region and beyond—SoundCloud, Spotify, Supercell and many others.  <br />
<br />
We can’t predict the kinds of inventions the Science Museum might showcase 10+ years from now, but we do know European startups will be essential to this future, and we can’t wait to see what they create. <br />

The <b>Hearing and Speech Agency</b> will use Glass to pilot new ways to improve communication access for people who have speech language challenges, hearing loss and autism—and support those who teach and care for them. And the <b>Mark Morris Dance Group</b> will create a Glass app that will build on their award-winning <a href=""http://danceforparkinsons.org/"">Dance for PD®</a> initiative to help people with Parkinson’s disease remember and trigger body movements in their daily lives. <br />
<br />
Finally, Glass will head across the U.S. by bicycle to help raise money and increase awareness for brain cancer research. For the first time, supporters of participants in the <b>3000 Miles to a Cure Race</b> Across America will be able to see and experience it through a racer’s eyes and the racer will be alerted to every message of encouragement and donation supporters send.<br />
<br />
Developers are already working with these inspiring groups, and next week these five nonprofits will descend on Google Glass' Base Camp in San Francisco for training, and to connect with their Google mentors. Stay tuned for updates on how the projects unfold!<br />

For the third straight year, Google and Make have come together to put on Maker Camp, a free, online summer camp for teens on Google+. Building on 2 million past participants, Maker Camp 2014 officially kicks off today at 11 a.m. PDT / 2 p.m. EDT today with a <a href=""http://goo.gl/ymlFPJ"">Hangout</a> featuring NASA and Buzz Aldrin. -</i>Ed.<br />
<br />
We’ve always believed that everyone, especially young people, should be able to feel the joy that comes from imagining and creating something that didn’t exist before.<br />
<br />
Nine years ago, we hosted our very first Bay Area Maker Faire, an all-ages gathering of tech enthusiasts, crafters, hobbyists and artists. The event was partly inspired by the idea that the special creative energy produced by kids is even stronger when they’re brought together. Since that first get-together, it has grown globally with more than 100 events in places like Tokyo, Rome, Santiago and Oslo. Recently, a man in Atlanta told me that “making” changed his son’s life—by inspiring self-confidence through the joys of engineering, design and music. And just last weekend, a family drove eight hours to reach a Maker Faire because their 14-year-old son, Daniel, was so excited about meeting other makers.  <br />
<br />
But eight hours is a long way to drive to connect with other creative kids. So to make sure that inspiration and community are more accessible to young makers—no matter where they are—we teamed up with Google to create <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+MAKE/posts"">Maker Camp</a>, now back for its third summer. Through Google+, Maker Camp connects young makers from across the globe as they create, invent and build projects like <a href=""http://makezine.com/projects/soda-bottle-rocket-led-fireworks/"">soda bottle rocket fireworks</a>, <a href=""http://makezine.com/projects/make-38-cameras-and-av/glow-bike/"">glowing bikes</a>, and <a href=""http://makezine.com/projects/led-shoe-clips/"">LED shoe clips</a> (our version of arts and crafts). In addition to the daily projects, campers will join epic virtual Friday field trips to places like <a class=""g-profile"" href=""https://plus.google.com/102371865054310418159"" target=""_blank"">+NASA</a>&nbsp;Goddard Space Flight Center, Google [x] and <a class=""g-profile"" href=""https://plus.google.com/118199612297395338408"" target=""_blank"">+LEGO</a>&nbsp;Education.<br />
<br />
Camp is available to anyone with an Internet connection and an imagination—and kids who’d rather gather together around the digital campfire can visit one of Maker Camp’s <a href=""http://makercamp.com/summer-2014/affiliate-map/"">500 local “campsites”</a> hosted by libraries and community centers, in locations ranging from Australia to Jordan. <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/eonbU6hZ7Ig"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
So roll up your virtual sleeping bag and come join us at Maker Camp this summer! To get started, simply follow <a href=""http://google.com/+make"">+Make on Google+</a>.<br />

DevArt celebrates developers who use technology as their canvas and code as their paintbrush to make art that explores and challenges the creative and technical limits of code. With the Barbican, we commissioned three interactive artists to create pieces for Digital Revolution. <a href=""https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/16501507"">Karsten Schmidt</a>’s <b>Co(de) Factory</b> empowers anyone to be an artist with an online design tool that creates 3D digital sculptures that may be showcased in the exhibition. <a href=""https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/15870625"">Zach Lieberman</a>’s <b>Play the World </b>uses code to find musical notes from hundreds of live radio stations around the world. When a visitor plays the piano at the centre of the piece, each note is precisely matched to one of those radio sounds, and played back via 360-degree speakers to create a uniquely global piece of music. And duo <a href=""https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/16494767"">Varvara Guljajeva and Mar Canet</a>’s <b>Wishing Wall</b> lets you whisper a wish, see your words projected in front of you, then transformed into a butterfly that (virtually) lands on your hand. <br />
<br />
We also put out a <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/devart-art-made-with-code.html"">global call</a> to undiscovered interactive artists for the opportunity to be commissioned by Google and Barbican, and exhibited alongside the DevArt artists. There were hundreds of entries, including a giant map (using Google Maps API) where <a href=""https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/16566495?t=finalist"">children can explore fantasy and reality</a>, a <a href=""https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/16589129?t=finalist"">group-play haptic musical instrument</a> that visualizes sound using Android, and <a href=""https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/17440244"">maps of dreams</a> as they move through the brain (using Google+ APIs).  In the end, the DevArt judges chose <b>Les Métamorphoses de Mr. Kalia</b>, by Cyril Diagne and Beatrice Lartigue, which allows you to use your body's movements to control a larger-than-life animated character, transforming basic movement into a powerful visual performance. <br />

We want to inspire a new generation of coders and artists to see what they can create with technology as their canvas. Soon, we’ll kick off our <a href=""https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/young-creators"">DevArt Young Creators</a> program, a set of workshops hosted by DevArt artists for students aged 9-13 years who have never tried coding before. Each workshop will be developed into lesson plans in line with the U.K.’s new national computing curriculum, and distributed to educators by arts and technology organizations. <br />
<br />
DevArt and the Digital Revolution exhibition will be at the Barbican in London until September 15, and after that will tour the world for up to five years. If you can’t make it in person, you can see all this <a href=""http://g.co/devart"">incredible art online</a> or watch our launch film to learn more:<br />

We know Cristiano Ronaldo can strut his stuff on the football pitch—and in the occasional Armani ad—but he’s taking it to new heights on the search charts. Topping longtime rival Lionel Messi and rising icon Neymar, Ronaldo proves all you need to win in search is serious dribbling skills, a chiseled jawline and a unique haircut (although the reason behind his hairstyle may be pretty <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/worldcup/cristiano-ronaldo-haircut-did-portugal-star-zigzag-his-hair-in-tribute-to-erik-ortiz-cruz-9556333.html"">heartwarming</a> … if true). <br />

A World Cup is only as good as its <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_spot/2014/06/27/_2014_world_cup_goals_watch_all_136_goals_from_the_group_stage_video.html"">goals</a>—and we’ve seen a couple of doozies this time around. Robin Van Persie’s leaping header made him an overnight <a href=""http://mashable.com/2014/06/16/van-persie-header-goal-meme/"">Internet</a> sensation, while people were excited to see that Messi got his groove back after scoring his first World Cup goal in eight years. And if you blinked, you might have missed Clint Dempsey’s goal in the U.S.A’s 2-1 victory over Ghana. Clocking in at 32 seconds after the start of the match, Dempsey scored the fastest American goal in World Cup history. That feat, however, couldn’t save the United States as they fell victim to the latest goal in World Cup history off the head of Silvestre Varela.<br />

Do you take your fish and chips with pasta? Searchers were eager to watch England and Italy’s clash for Group D dominance (spoiler alert: both teams got the boot) while the U.S.A.’s match against Ghana took second place in search. Rounding out the top three, we’re pretty sure Guillermo Ochoa’s stellar performance and totally convincing impression of a <a href=""https://twitter.com/espn/status/479004917420785664/photo/1"">wall</a> was what made the Brazil vs. Mexico match a hot one.<br />

It was a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dance+off"">dance-off</a> on the trends charts as Daniel Sturridge's wave won over the crowd ahead of Neymar’s funky jig. But our personal favorite has to be the Ghanaian national team’s collaborative routine after star striker Asamoah Gyan scored a goal to take the lead in their match against Germany.

It’s not really about football unless you mention WAGs (“wives and girlfriends” of players). Amongst leading ladies, Colombian singer Shakira steals the search show. And after her partner, Spanish defender Gerard Pique, and his team suffered a World Cup collapse, it just might be a good thing she’s the center of attention. <br />

4591592676783995325,,Google Blogs,2014-06-25T11:44:00-07:00,Coming to a screen near you,"This morning we welcomed 6,000 developers to our 7th annual Google I/O developer conference. The crowd in San Francisco was joined by millions more watching on the livestream and 597 I/O Extended events, in 90+ countries on six continents.<br />
<br />
We’re meeting at an exciting time for Google, and for our developer community. There are now one billion of you around the world who use an Android device. One billion. We estimate that’s more than 20 billion text messages sent every day. 1.5 trillion steps taken with an Android. And more importantly, a roughly estimated 93M selfies.<br />
<br />
Today, developers got a preview of our most ambitious Android release yet. With more than 5,000 new APIs (for non-techies, that stands for application programming interfaces) and a new, consistent design approach called <a href=""http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2014/06/this-is-material-design.html"">material design</a>, we’re continuing to evolve the Android platform so developers can bring to life even more beautiful, engaging mobile experiences. <br />
<br />
But, beyond the mobile phone, many of us are increasingly surrounded by a range of screens throughout the day--at home, at work, in the car, or even on our wrist. So, we got to thinking: how do we invest more in our two popular, open platforms—Android and Chrome—to make it easier for you to easily and intuitively move from your phone, tablet, laptop to your TV, car or even your watch?<br />
<br />
That question was answered for the I/O crowd today. Here are some highlights:<br />
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<img height=""155"" src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/y5iP-0G7IEDdqR2W-vkbScKCDiJo_6oa5cJ-iEMAJn6Xh7euYJQwMIAEliaoGwnrOSW-w89iPVUXpmf-f0zP7li81omfqU8fPFwgK4m9m0AUDRmjltujgub4BMm6HGFtmg"" width=""640"" /></div>
<b>On the go: Android Wear and Android Auto</b><br />
Most people check their phones more than 150 times a day. Often, it’s to read a text, look at a notification, or get some other simple piece of information. That’s a lot of time spent unlocking, swiping and entering passwords, when your hands could easily be free handling more important things. <br />
<br />
Enter <a href=""http://www.android.com/wear"">Android Wear</a>, which extends Android, and its ecosystem of apps, to that most familiar spot for a “wearable,” your wrist. You get the information you need, quickly at a glance—just like you’re used to doing with your watch. Just say “Ok Google” to ask questions or to get stuff done. Get alerted when it's time to leave for dinner. Call a cab to take you there. See the traffic on the way. Text a friend once you're seated. It’s all right there, on your wrist, easy to see, right when you want it. Today we announced that two Android wearables, the LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live, are available to order today on Google Play, and the Moto 360 from Motorola will be available in the coming months. Your thumbs will thank you.  <br />
<br />
It’s one thing to be able to simply check your wrist for what you need when you’re on the go. But what about when you’re in your car? Many of us want to stay connected even while driving. Getting directions, traffic updates, finding just the right music playlist. But using our phones while at the wheel is simply unsafe. <br />
<br />
Android Auto, which we <a href=""http://youtu.be/Ht8yzpIV9M0"">showed</a> to developers today, takes care of that for you. Just connect your Android phone to a car with Android Auto, and you’ll have what you need at your fingertips such as turn-by-turn navigation from Google Maps, your curated playlists and radio stations through Play Music, simple-to-use voice search, and reminders from Google Now. This is accessible through your car’s controls, and more importantly, is far safer than fumbling around with your phone. You’ll start to see Android Auto in cars later this year.<br />
<br />
<b>In the living room: Chromecast and Android TV</b><br />
So, you get out of your car, and now you’re home, after a long day, in front of the TV. Last summer, we launched Chromecast, a small, affordable device that lets you cast online video, music and anything from the web to your TV. It’s getting an update to make it even more powerful, and convenient to use, with new features like the ability to allow others to cast to your TV without needing to be on the same WiFi network, a customizable homescreen with personal photos or beautiful art, and casting exactly what is on your Android phone or tablet screen directly to the TV.<br />
<br />
Now, in addition to Chromecast, <a href=""http://www.android.com/tv"">Android TV</a> brings all that you love about Android apps and games to your living room. Android is baked directly into your TV-watching experience, through a set-top box or as part of your TV. You can use voice search to find a live TV show, a good flick from Google Play, or a music video on YouTube. Plus, because it’s Android, you’ll be able to play your favorite Android games, reimagined for TV and with a gamepad. Android TV, which, like Chromecast, supports Google Cast technology, will ship with products from a range of consumer electronics companies later this year. <br />
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/d36cIFCJvQs"" width=""640""></iframe><br /></div>
<b>For the next billion: Android One</b><br />
All these amazing multi-screen experiences are built around a smartphone and basic internet connectivity. However, there are many people—billions of people, in fact—who still don’t have access to a smartphone. We want to change that; so today we announced an important initiative called Android One. <br />
<br />
We’re working with partners on a comprehensive solution—which includes hardware reference platforms—to address the mobile computing needs of those in emerging markets. Android One will provide smartphones that are high quality, affordable and come with reasonable data plans. Our partners will launch an initial range of sub-$100 Android One smartphones starting in India this Fall, with more countries to follow. We’ve long wondered what potential could be unleashed if people everywhere had access to the latest technology and the world's information. It's time to find out.<br />
<br />
<b>Design, Develop, Distribute</b><br />
All in all, Android and Chrome are the platforms that make these experiences possible, but the products developers build upon them are what make it all come alive. Google I/O allows us to show them what we’re up to—whether it’s a new approach to design, new developer tools, or new ways to reach the next billion people who come online. <br />
<br />
For all you developers out there, thanks for everything you do. We can’t wait to see what you build next.<br />

With the ever increasing international focus on the LGBT community (searches for LGBT-related terms on Google have increased 41% since 2004 and started really picking up steam in March 2010) it has become even more evident that despite the marriage equality gains made in the United States, much more work needs to be done to ensure the safety and rights of the LGBT community everywhere.

Google’s Pride is spreading: We are now the first-ever corporate sponsor and contingent in the Seoul Pride Parade, and a Gaygler contingent is marching for the first time in Mexico City. And, thanks to the valiant planning efforts of a Gaygler ally, Google will be represented at WorldPride in Toronto this year - we’ll be the ones with a double decker bus handing out Google Pride stickers, wearing Google Pride t-shirts!<br />
<br />
<b>1. #Pridecast on Google+ and YouTube</b><br />
This year, you can enjoy Pride from anywhere - whether your town has a march or not. On June 29, The NYC Pride March will be home base for #Pridecast, a live, online Pride celebration on Google+ and YouTube. Along with NYC Pride, we’ll be streaming the best moments from the march, and bringing in well-known LGBT advocates -- like Laverne Cox of Orange is the New Black, Jonathan Groff of Glee and Frozen, activist Rea Carey, and Scandal’s Dan Bucatinsky -- in person and from around the world via Hangouts On Air.<br />
<br />
Celebrate with us - and <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+NYCPride/posts"">tune in on Google+</a> and YouTube at 12:30pm ET on Sunday, June 29.  <br />
<br />
These are just a few ways Google is celebrating Pride Month.  We encourage everyone to continue to celebrate well beyond this month--to keep marching, to keep speaking up--until gay rights are fully recognized for what they are: basic human rights.  <br />
<br />
Happy Pride, everybody!<br />

<br />
<b>There’s football … and then there’s everything else</b><br />
The Internet is still gobbling up every last bit of the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=World+Cup&amp;std=20140616&amp;pn=p1#a=20140616-World+Cup"">World Cup</a> as searches for the sport reached near ravenous levels (who knew we were so starved of the beautiful game?) <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F0gx_wd9&amp;date=today%207-d&amp;cmpt=q"">John Brooks</a>, a previously obscure member of the USMNT, was on the top of the Internet’s head after using his own to score the game-winning goal against Ghana for the United States. From [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=England+vs+Italy&amp;std=20140614&amp;pn=p1#a=20140614-England+vs+Italy"">england vs italy</a>] to [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Brazil+vs+Mexico&amp;std=20140616&amp;pn=p1#a=20140616-Brazil+vs+Mexico"">brazil vs mexico</a>] no match was left untouched, or unsearched.  <br />
<br />
But the [world cup] wasn’t the only sport that mattered this week (even though it might have seemed like it). The Stanley Cup winner <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=LA+Kings&amp;std=20140613&amp;pn=p1#a=20140613-LA+Kings"">LA Kings</a> and recently crowned NBA champions <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Spurs&amp;std=20140615&amp;pn=p1#a=20140615-Spurs"">San Antonio Spurs</a> topped the charts just for one day. In more serious news, people checked in on <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Michael+Schumacher&amp;std=20140616&amp;pn=p1#a=20140616-Michael+Schumacher"">Michael Schumacher</a>, the Formula 1 driver who was put into a coma after a skiing accident, and mourned the loss of baseball player <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Tony+Gwynn&amp;std=20140616&amp;pn=p1#a=20140616-Tony+Gwynn"">Tony Gwynn</a> to cancer.<br />

Speaking of royalty, little Prince George walked his way to the trends charts, as people were eager to find photos and videos of his first steps, making Prince William a proud papa during his first <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Happy+Fathers+Day&amp;std=20140614&amp;pn=p1#a=20140614-Happy+Fathers+Day"">Father’s Day</a>. <br />

<b>Searching my way way back to you ...</b><br />
Clint Eastwood’s latest movie, the film adaptation of the acclaimed musical Jersey Boys, is hitting a theater near you this week, and searchers are looking for showtimes and reviews before they head to the theater. We’ll have to wait and see if the movie proves to be as successful as <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=22+Jump+Street&amp;std=20140613&amp;pn=p1#a=20140613-22+Jump+Street"">22 Jump Street</a>, which is still trending from last week. While films battle it out for box office supremacy, rumors are swirling that Khal Drogo (sometimes known as <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Jason+Momoa&amp;std=20140614&amp;pn=p1#a=20140614-Jason+Momoa"">Jason Momoa</a>) could be playing Aquaman in the upcoming Batman vs. Superman flick … we won’t hold our breath on that one.<br />

<br />
These are all women with cool, amazing jobs. But, more important, they’re all women who use computer science, and an ability to code, to do those cool, amazing jobs. They couldn’t do what they do without having learned not just to use technology, but to build it themselves. Unfortunately, there are far too few women like them and far too few young girls following their paths. In fact, fewer than <a href=""http://www.aauw.org/files/2013/02/Why-So-Few-Women-in-Science-Technology-Engineering-and-Mathematics.pdf"">one percent</a> of high school girls express interest in majoring in computer science. <br />
<br />
This is an issue that hits home for me. My school-age daughter instinctively knows how to play games, watch videos and chat with friends online. She understands technology. And she likes using technology.  But, she never expressed any interest in creating it herself.  <br />
<br />
So, I decided to launch a campaign at home — connecting my daughter to coding resources, increasing my encouragement and introducing her to other girls interested in computer science. It wasn’t always easy, but it’s already showing results. She recently started learning basic computer languages and using code to do projects at home. <br />

<br />
Today, we’re attempting to solve this issue on a much larger scale. Along with Chelsea Clinton, Girls Inc., Girl Scouts of the USA, Mindy Kaling, MIT Media Lab, National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology, SevenTeen, TechCrunch and more, Google is launching <a href=""http://www.madewithcode.com/"">Made with Code</a>, an initiative to inspire girls to code. The program includes:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Cool introductory <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/blockly/"">Blockly</a>-based coding <a href=""https://www.madewithcode.com/projects"">projects</a>, like designing a bracelet 3D-printed by <a href=""http://www.shapeways.com/"">Shapeways</a>, learning to create animated GIFs and building beats for a music track.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Collaborations with organizations like Girl Scouts of the USA and Girls, Inc. to introduce Made with Code to girls in their networks, encouraging them to complete their first coding experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A commitment of $50 million to support programs that can help get more females into computer science, like rewarding teachers who support girls who take CS courses on <a href=""http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/donorschooseorg"">Codecademy</a> or <a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/donors-choose"">Khan Academy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
We’ve also posted <a href=""https://www.madewithcode.com/mentors"">videos</a> about women who are using code in their dream jobs, like Miral, Danielle, Erica and other inspirational girl coders — like <a href=""https://www.madewithcode.com/article#brittany-wenger"">Brittany Wenger</a>, who is using code to fight cancer. And, we’ve developed a few <a href=""https://www.madewithcode.com/bigdeal"">steps</a> parents can take at home to get their daughters excited about computer science.  Read more about the initiative <a href=""http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2014/06/made-with-code-an-effort-by-google-to-inspire-girls-to-code.html"">here</a>.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, coding isn’t just a skill useful for working at a tech company; engineering isn’t just for engineers. Interior design. Medicine. Architecture. Music. No matter what a girl dreams of doing, learning how to code will help her get there. Their future — our future — is made with code. Let’s do what we can to make sure that future is as bright as possible. <br />

<b>New cinema classics?</b><br />
This week in entertainment, it seems to be all about the sequels. Harry, Lloyd and the Mutt Cutts van are back in <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Dumb+And+Dumber+2&amp;std=20140611&amp;pn=p1#a=20140611-Dumb+And+Dumber+2""><i>Dumb and Dumber To</i></a>, which premiered its trailer on the <i>Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i> this week. As Harry says in the original movie, “Just when I thought you couldn't possibly be any dumber, you go and do something like this... and totally redeem yourself!” (Well, we’ll see, at least.) Meanwhile, cop comedy <i><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=22+Jump+Street&amp;std=20140613&amp;pn=p1#a=20140613-22+Jump+Street"">22 Jump Street</a></i> debuts in theaters today and searches are spiking for the film as well as for one of its (newer) stars—actress <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=22%20jump%20street&amp;date=today%201-m&amp;cmpt=q"">Amber Stevens</a>. <br />
<br />
<b>Surprises at the polls</b><br />
Americans got a major surprise this week in Virginia when U.S. House Majority Leader <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Eric+Cantor&amp;std=20140610&amp;pn=p1#a=20140610-Eric+Cantor"">Eric Cantor</a> lost the primary election to the relatively unknown David Brat. People turned to the web to learn more about the upset, though searches for Cantor still dominate over those for Brat overall. <br />

8039396741429567744,,Google Blogs,2014-06-10T08:00:00-07:00,The world is a canvas: introducing the street art project,"Here today, gone tomorrow. The transient nature of street art means it can be at risk of being scrubbed out and lost forever to its legions of fans. But long after the paint has faded from the walls, technology can help preserve street art, so people can discover it wherever and whenever they like.  In a new project launching today, we’ve partnered with street art experts to bring you 5,000+ images and around 100 exhibitions in the Google Art Project—telling a story of street art around the world.<br />
<br />
Starting today, you can immerse yourself in a world of <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/natureza-viva/lAFtk1AMGT0W9Q?exhibitId=QQ6aWbVP&amp;projectId=street-art"">prowling foxes on lonely walls</a>,  <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/museo-a-cielo-abierto-en-san-miguel/ARMT8hww?projectId=street-art"">supernatural symbolism</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/holy-warrior/2QG87JPwLJOztw?projectId=street-art"">murals</a> on a grand scale,  <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/stikman-chelsea/NQEKtYcQqh_o_w?projectId=street-art"">tiny hard-to-spot icons</a>, or <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/untitled/OwFuIiJHeD0ALQ?projectId=street-art"">trompe l’oeil</a> techniques that use physical details of the wall itself to trick the eye.  <br />
<br />
Some of this work was created as a means of expression and activism, like the Chilean open-sky museums of <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/museo-a-cielo-abierto-en-la-pincoya?hl=en-GB&amp;projectId=street-art"">La Pincoya</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/museo-a-cielo-abierto-san-miguel?hl=en-GB&amp;projectId=street-art"">San Miguel</a>, which were born as community projects to transform poverty-stricken neighborhoods,  or to make a political statement like in <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/mural-by-hin-cranio/lwHA3kSD9Qbj1Q?projectId=street-art"">London</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/no-more-hunger/2QHyg751PSZYFw?projectId=street-art"">Atlanta</a>.<br />
<br />
It’s not just about spraypaint either—other exhibits demonstrate the signature style of the artist, like <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/jr/HwHifuxgIt3cYQ?projectId=street-art"">JR’s large-scale and evocative photo-portraits</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/mural-by-roa/lwGQVgIhfOlvyg?projectId=street-art"">Roa’s animals</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/vhils/6gEXdscDyaVEcA?projectId=street-art"">Vhils’ etching</a> or <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/untitled/1gFzuTyPNDAlhg?projectId=art-project"">Os Gemeos surrealism</a>.<br />

2201937615301306696,,Google Blogs,2014-06-10T00:00:00-07:00,Hangout Bridges: Bringing together young Jews and Arabs,"The fortressed city of <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@32.918927,35.069553,3a,75y,353.91h,80.85t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1s9jQGcopMhnCFStwGWa9NyA!2e0!3e5"">Acre</a> lies on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in northern Israel. An important Middle Eastern city in ancient times, it’s now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With its fortified walls, citadel, mosques, synagogues, khans, baths and Crusader structures, Acre has always been a meeting place for East and West, new and old. Today, it’s a mixed Jewish-Arab city, but people from the two communities interact all too rarely. Mistrust, and sometimes outright hostility, keep the two communities apart.<br />
<br />
We wanted to see if the Internet could help break down some of these barriers. So last September, a group of 40 students from the separate Arab and Jewish schools in the city, together with 200 Arab, Jewish, Druze and Bedouin students from other communities in Israel, took part in “<a href=""http://hangout-bridges.com/"">Hangout Bridges: Bridges to Peace</a>.” A partnership with <a href=""http://en.ort.org.il/352/"">ORT</a>, Israel’s largest educational network of schools and colleges, and the <a href=""http://www.peres-center.org/who_we_are"">Peres Center for Peace</a>, the program uses <a href=""http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/"">Hangouts</a> to help create understanding—and friendship—between these communities. <br />
<br />
Grouped together by their teachers into multi-cultural Google+ circles, the students got to know each other online and started working on joint projects. Each circle met on average 10 times on Hangouts, then in a series of face-to-face meetings.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/xw28_Vepd1U"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
Last week, we hosted the finale event of the program at <a href=""https://www.campustelaviv.com/"">Campus Tel Aviv</a>, a tech hub for developers and entrepreneurs at our Tel Aviv office. The students and their teachers enjoyed a creative session with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hQR8iaJIbU"">System Ali</a>, a multicultural rap group, and an inspirational talk with the leaders of <a href=""http://meet.mit.edu/"">MEET</a>, an educational initiative that brings together young Israeli and Palestinian leaders. The students then presented the projects they've been working on for the last eight months, including a <a href=""http://hangout-bridges.com/project/2014-2/heritage-trail-in-akko/"">walking tour of Acre</a> using Google Maps that seeks to uncover the rich Jewish-Arab history of this ancient city; <a href=""http://hangout-bridges.com/project/2014-2/surfing-for-peace/"">educational Hebrew-Arabic websites</a> that address racism and prejudice in sports, provide information on relevant legislation and offer quizzes on the topic; and an <a href=""http://hangout-bridges.com/project/2014-2/together-we-can-reach-the-sun/"">original song performed in Hebrew, Arabic and English</a>, emphasizing coexistence and mutual respect. <br />
<br />
This is the second year we’ve run “Hangout Bridges” in Israel. For our next course, starting this coming fall, we’re doubling the number of participants. We hope we can expand to other countries and help—in a small way—build bridges of mutual understanding around the world. As participant Wasim Jass put it: “I learned that we can cast off the hatred and plant love in its place.”<br />

4170088038955864680,,Google Blogs,2014-06-09T07:14:00-07:00,Doodle 4 Google 2014: An inventive doodle for clean water ,"On google.com today, you may have noticed an intricately drawn version of our logo showing an unusual water purifier, surrounded by a variety of fantastical creatures. This doodle is the result of our seventh annual Doodle 4 Google competition, where we asked kids, grades K-12, to tell us what they’d invent to help make the world a better place. Today, out of more than 100,000 submissions, <a href=""https://plus.google.com/photos/+GoogleforEducation/albums/6021880272552062081"">250 state finalists</a>, 50 state winners, and five national age group winners, we’re excited to present the 2014 U.S. Doodle 4 Google winner—11-year old Audrey Zhang of New York! <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Z080V3YWVDg"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
In the spirit of our theme around inventiveness, we asked Audrey to spend a day with the doodlers following our awards ceremony to help animate her illustration. In her new role as animator and film director, the ever detail-oriented Audrey made sure that each light would flicker and that the water was clean enough to (virtually) drink in. She was especially passionate about the illustration’s dragons—about whom (oh, by the way) she is also writing a novel.  <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

In addition to seeing her finished work on our homepage today, Audrey received a $30,000 college scholarship and $50,000 Google for Education technology grant for her school. And to help make Audrey’s vision of water purification a reality, we donated $20,000 in her name to charity:water, a charity that brings clean water to developing nations, to provide clean water to schools in Bangladesh.<br />

And as the summer break approaches, math games like [brainpop], [mymathlab] and [scratch] are trending in search—a good sign that parents and students are looking to stay sharp over vacation! <br />
<br />
<b>Tip of the week</b><br />
Ready to cry? Just ask Google Search (on <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-search/id284815942?mt=8"">iOS</a> and <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox"">Android</a>) to “show me movie times for The Fault In Our Stars.” You’ll see nearby theaters and showtimes, and can click on the time you like to buy a ticket online. “Ok Google, remind me to bring tissues!” <br />

14172546809803866,,Google Blogs,2014-06-03T13:02:00-07:00,Transparency Report: Protecting emails as they travel across the web,"When you mail a letter to your friend, you hope she’ll be the only person who reads it. But a lot could happen to that letter on its way from you to her, and prying eyes might try to take a look. That’s why we send important messages in sealed envelopes, rather than on postcards.<br />
<br />
Email works in a similar way. Emails that are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption"">encrypted</a> as they’re routed from sender to receiver are like sealed envelopes, and less vulnerable to snooping—whether by bad actors or through government surveillance—than postcards.<br />
<br />
But some email is more secure than others. So to help you better understand whether your emails are protected by encryption, we’re launching a <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/saferemail/"">new section</a> in the <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport"">Transparency Report</a>.<br />

Gmail has always supported encryption in transit by using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS), and will <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/03/staying-at-forefront-of-email-security.html"">automatically encrypt</a> your incoming and outgoing emails if it can. The important thing is that <i>both</i> sides of an email exchange need to support encryption for it to work; Gmail can't do it alone.<br />
<br />
Our data show that approximately 40 to 50 percent of emails sent between Gmail and other email providers aren’t encrypted. Many providers have turned on encryption, and others have said they’re going to, which is great news. As they do, more and more emails will be shielded from snooping.<br />
<br />
For people looking for even stronger email security, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption"">end-to-end encryption</a> is a good option—but it’s been hard to use. So today we’re making available the source code for <a href=""http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/06/making-end-to-end-encryption-easier-to.html"">End-to-End</a>, a Chrome extension. It's currently in testing, and once it's ready for general use it will make this technology easier for those who choose to use it.<br />

<br />
<b>Books in the news</b><br />
On Wednesday, the beloved author Maya Angelou passed away at the age of 86. More than 2 million searches have taken place this week as people looked for information about her life and work. Popular queries related to the author this week include [maya angelou quotes], [maya angelou poems] and [still i rise].<br />

Take a look, it’s in a book… on the web? More than 30 years after it first premiered, the beloved PBS show “Reading Rainbow” was in the news this week when former host LeVar Burton formed a Kickstarter campaign to fund a Reading Rainbow literacy program. In less than 24 hours, Burton had met his goal of a million dollars. <br />
<br />
<b>Sporting surprises</b><br />
The NBA and NHL playoffs continue to dominate sports fans' minds, but this week in addition to the more expected [rangers], [blackhawks], [heat], [spurs], etc. there were a few less common sporting searches. Rapper 50 Cent threw out a first pitch for the Mets on Tuesday, and it was a little, um, off the mark. People headed to Google to look for video and GIFs of the wild pitch. Some might say 50 Cent may want to stay in da club and off the mound.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in tennis, French Open number-one seed Serena Williams was defeated by a lower-ranked young player, Garbine Muguruza, who grew up idolizing Serena’s game. Finally, anticipation for summer soccer is heating up. Late last week we learned that player Landon Donovan would not be included in the United States’ World Cup roster this year. Searches for Donovan immediately spiked to reach a new high for the last year, with related terms [klinsmann] and [landon donovan twitter] rising as well.<br />
<br />
<b>Long weekend festivities </b><br />
This week marked Memorial Day in the U.S., and many Americans celebrated with [parades] and [fireworks] to honor service members, and also hit up the mall for weekend [sales]. Other celebrations took place this weekend too: amidst a host of college students walking across the dais this weekend, there was one grad who's more known for her prowess in a fictional school. Harry Potter star Emma Watson graduated from Brown University (the Hogwarts of Rhode Island) this weekend, and searches for the actress were even higher than when she presented at the Oscars (woo, education!). But no weekend wrapup would be complete without at least a mention of... yes, Kimye. The long-anticipated and not-so-secret nuptials of Kanye West and [kim kardashian] took place in Europe over the weekend, leading hordes of curious searchers to look for dirt on the dress, the rehearsal dinner and more.<br />

4528102464351083400,,Google Blogs,2014-05-30T12:19:00-07:00,Staying safe this hurricane season,"Earlier this month, Vivek Maheshwari was heading to the airport after a business trip in Denver when he received a <a href=""http://google.org/publicalerts/alert?aid=198f390a869019&amp;source=pa&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US"">public alert notification</a> on his phone telling him there was a tornado heading his way. Luckily, the storm was still a few miles off, so he was able to find an alternate route to the airport and make it home safely. <br />
<br />
Easy and timely access to information can make a huge difference in times of crisis—whether to help people like Vivek get out of harm’s way, or to help those affected after a disaster has occurred. The web can help by providing access to official alerts from government organizations, news reports and on-the-ground updates from social media. The key is making sure that all that information can get to those who are affected—as quickly as possible. <br />
<br />
That’s one of the things our <a href=""http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/"">Crisis Response Team</a> focuses on. Since 2010, we’ve been working to make disaster-related information immediately available and useful in a crisis, through tools like <a href=""http://www.google.org/publicalerts/"">Public Alerts</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.org/crisismap"">Crisis Map</a> and <a href=""http://google.org/personfinder/"">Person Finder</a>. And since next week marks the start of hurricane season in the North Atlantic, we thought we’d provide a few tips to help you prepare for potential summer disasters—from tropical storms to wildfires to floods. <br />
<br />
<b>Make sure you’ll receive Public Alerts</b><br />
<a href=""http://www.google.org/crisisresponse/publicalerts/"">Google Public Alerts</a>, launched two years ago, is a tool that sends people alerts from authoritative sources like the U.S. National Weather Service or the Japan Meteorological Agency during emergencies. They’re accessible through the <a href=""http://www.google.com/landing/now/#howtogetit"">Google search app on your mobile devices</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/landing/now/#getitchrome"">Google Chrome on your computer</a>, as well as in search results for related queries and on Google Maps when relevant.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

People have used Public Alerts to get to safety before a <a href=""http://www.google.org/publicalerts/alert?aid=7771f3c99aed6017"">landslide in Colombia</a>, set up sandbags before a <a href=""http://www.google.org/publicalerts/alert?aid=dc483a6288e7478"">thunderstorm in Utah</a>, and get off the road before an <a href=""http://www.google.org/publicalerts/alert?aid=c4a053595ff368e9"">ice storm in Kentucky</a>. To make sure you get the information you need to know when you need it, <a href=""http://www.google.com/landing/now/#howtogetit"">get Google Now</a> on your Android device, iOS device, or computer.<br />
<br />
Public Alerts are now available in seven countries (U.S., Australia, Canada, Colombia, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan) and will continue to roll out to new countries this year. <br />
<br />
<b>Install emergency preparedness apps</b><br />
There are a number of great apps which can help you prepare for or outlast an emergency. For example, a <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/search?q=flashlight&amp;c=apps"">flashlight app</a> can be useful if the power goes out and you don’t have access to a regular flashlight (use a regular flashlight if you can to conserve your phone’s battery). The <a href=""http://www.redcross.org/prepare/mobile-apps"">first-aid and disaster preparedness apps from the Red Cross</a> have a lot of valuable information. And the official <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.fema.mobile.android"">FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) app</a> has information on how to stay safe during a disaster, the locations of FEMA disaster recovery stations, and more. <br />
<br />
And remember, when bad weather is on the way, keep your phone plugged in and follow this <a href=""https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2819525?hl=en"">advice</a> to conserve battery life on Android. If you’re using an iOS device, try <a href=""http://www.apple.com/batteries/iphone.html"">these tips</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Get helpful gadgets</b><br />
A <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=waterproof+phone+case&amp;es_sm=119&amp;tbm=shop&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lhxgU6qqOYegyATm44DwAQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1288&amp;bih=632&amp;dpr=1.1"">waterproof phone case</a> can help protect your phone during floods or heavy rains and a <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=waterproof+phone+case&amp;es_sm=119&amp;tbm=shop&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lhxgU6qqOYegyATm44DwAQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1288&amp;bih=632&amp;dpr=1.1#q=solar+phone+charger&amp;tbm=shop"">portable solar-powered charger</a> will help keep your phone’s battery alive. It may also be a good idea to invest in a <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?tbm=shop&amp;q=solar+powered+charger#q=cell+phone+signal+booster&amp;tbm=shop"">cell phone signal booster</a> which gives you a greater chance of connecting to an operational cell tower. <br />
<br />
Of course, tech can only take you so far, so make sure you have the basics (like a <a href=""http://www.ready.gov/build-a-kit"">disaster supplies kit</a> and a <a href=""http://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan"">family emergency plan</a>) covered too—<a href=""http://ready.gov/"">Ready.gov</a> is a great resource. <br />
<br />
While it’s impossible to predict the weather, we hope these tips help you and your family prepare for the possibility of things going wrong. Stay safe this summer!<br />

6743095011263079930,,Google Blogs,2014-05-29T12:11:00-07:00,A new learning environment at Mater Dei in Brazil,"We launched Google Apps for Education because we believed it would help students learn more collaboratively and help educators spend less time on administration and more time on teaching. It’s been thrilling to see how some schools take “<a href=""http://www.google.com/edu/"">going Google</a>” to the next level and into their own hands—coming up with even more creative ways of incorporating technology in education. Recently we came across one of these schools: <a href=""http://colegiomaterdei.net/"">Colégio Mater Dei in Brazil</a>. <br />
<br />
In 2013, Mater Dei deployed Google Apps for Education as part of a move to incorporate technology into the academic environment. After they started to see early results, they came to Google with a plan: create a space on campus that’s designed from the ground up to be a technology-powered learning center for K-12 students. Last week, that idea became a reality when Mater Dei launched what we’re now calling the Google Learning Space. <br />
<br />
Transforming a part of their campus that used to be a traditional library, the school set up a high-performance wireless network in a room full of bright, colorful cushions and chairs where students can brainstorm, meet to discuss projects and talk with their teachers. There are two smart TVs with Chromecast installed, so students can project assignments, presentations and videos easily. There's a library of tablets and Chromebooks that students can use, all featuring Google Play and Google Apps.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>High school history students collaborate on tablets in the Google Learning Space </i></div>
<br />
The school’s ultimate goal is to increase collaboration amongst students and encourage them to think more creatively instead of learning by rote memorization. And so far, the results seem to be good—the school is already experimenting with new ways to teach and learn. For example, kindergarten teachers are helping students “visit” countries around the world with Google Earth and the Cultural Institute. Electronics teacher Andre Godoy is using Google Sites and Google Glass to help his students build a formula that can move a robot with a swipe of the finger. And biology teachers have started using the Google Play app Biodigital Human to help bring anatomy to life in 3D; students can add, remove and manipulate each organ of the body using the app, gaining an understanding of various diseases and how treatments are developed. Best of all, students and teachers seem more energized and excited to participate in class.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>Grade school students work with interactive biology apps from the Google Play Store</i></div>

The Google Learning Space is just one example of how bringing technology into the classroom can have a real and immediate impact on both teachers and students. We’re excited to keep working on products that can help kids learn—in Brazil and around the world. <br />

We now realize we were wrong, and that it’s time to be candid about the issues. Put simply, Google is not where we want to be when it comes to diversity, and it’s hard to address these kinds of challenges if you’re not prepared to discuss them openly, and with the facts. So, <a href=""http://google.com/diversity"">here are our numbers</a>:<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9lnieiaCtp4/U4ZXE1rMFII/AAAAAAAAOlw/mkWpETUZebw/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-05-27+at+6.00.47+PM.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9lnieiaCtp4/U4ZXE1rMFII/AAAAAAAAOlw/mkWpETUZebw/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-05-27+at+6.00.47+PM.png"" height=""411"" width=""640"" /></a></div>
There are lots of reasons why technology companies like Google struggle to recruit and retain women and minorities. For example, women <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_349.asp"">earn roughly 18 percent</a> of all computer science degrees in the United States. Blacks and Hispanics each make up <a href=""http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/c2/c2s3.htm"">under 10 percent of U.S. college grads</a> and each collect fewer than 10 percent of degrees in CS majors. So we’ve invested a lot of time and energy in education.<br />
<br />
Among other things, since 2010 we’ve given more than $40 million to organizations working to bring computer science education to women and girls. And we’ve been working with historically black colleges and universities to elevate coursework and attendance in computer science. For example, this year Google engineer Charles Pratt was in-residence at Howard University, where he revamped the school’s Intro to CS curriculum. <br />
<br />
But we’re the first to admit that Google is miles from where we want to be—and that being totally clear about the extent of the problem is a really important part of the solution.

1276834316258042612,,Google Blogs,2014-05-28T01:00:00-07:00,Better data centers through machine learning,"It’s no secret that we’re obsessed with saving energy. For over a decade we’ve been <a href=""http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/"">designing and building data centers</a> that use half the energy of a typical data center, and we’re always looking for ways to reduce our energy use even further. In our pursuit of extreme efficiency, we’ve hit upon a new tool: machine learning. Today we’re releasing a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/viewer?url=www.google.com/about/datacenters/efficiency/internal/assets/machine-learning-applicationsfor-datacenter-optimization-finalv2.pdf"">white paper</a>&nbsp;(PDF) on how we’re using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network"">neural networks</a> to optimize data center operations and drive our energy use to new lows. <br />
<br />
It all started as a 20 percent project, a Google tradition of carving out time for work that falls outside of one’s official job description. Jim Gao, an engineer on our data center team, is well-acquainted with the operational data we gather daily in the course of running our data centers. We calculate <a href=""http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/efficiency/internal/"">PUE</a>, a measure of energy efficiency, every 30 seconds, and we’re constantly tracking things like total IT load (the amount of energy our servers and networking equipment are using at any time), outside air temperature (which affects how our cooling towers work) and the levels at which we set our mechanical and cooling equipment. Being a smart guy—our affectionate nickname for him is “Boy Genius”—Jim realized that we could be doing more with this data. He studied up on machine learning and started building models to predict—and improve—data center performance.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8Ba7c72OwJI/U4VvLDhGc6I/AAAAAAAAOlQ/buQPFDcCfyY/s1600/google-datacenter-tech-05.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8Ba7c72OwJI/U4VvLDhGc6I/AAAAAAAAOlQ/buQPFDcCfyY/s1600/google-datacenter-tech-05.jpg"" width=""550"" /></a></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>The mechanical plant at our facility in The Dalles, Ore. The data center team is constantly tracking the performance of the heat exchangers and other mechanical equipment pictured here. </i></div>
<br />
What Jim designed works a lot like other examples of machine learning, like speech recognition: a computer analyzes large amounts of data to recognize patterns and “learn” from them.  In a dynamic environment like a data center, it can be difficult for humans to see how all of the variables—IT load, outside air temperature, etc.—interact with each other. One thing computers are good at is seeing the underlying story in the data, so Jim took the information we gather in the course of our daily operations and ran it through a model to help make sense of complex interactions that his team—being mere mortals—may not otherwise have noticed. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L0SLVNkqYj8/U4VvX5belJI/AAAAAAAAOlc/uMtd_Vwqzp0/s1600/infographic.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L0SLVNkqYj8/U4VvX5belJI/AAAAAAAAOlc/uMtd_Vwqzp0/s1600/infographic.png"" height=""201"" width=""400"" /></a></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>A simplified version of what the models do: take a bunch of data, find the hidden interactions, then provide recommendations that optimize for energy efficiency. </i></div>
<br />
After some trial and error, Jim’s models are now 99.6 percent accurate in predicting PUE. This means he can use the models to come up with new ways to squeeze more efficiency out of our operations. For example, a couple months ago we had to take some servers offline for a few days—which would normally make that data center less energy efficient. But we were able to use Jim’s models to change our cooling setup temporarily—reducing the impact of the change on our PUE for that time period. Small tweaks like this, on an ongoing basis, add up to significant savings in both energy and money. <br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S8qcCScG9Sk/U4VvX6jD4rI/AAAAAAAAOlY/ugOZ_74W8iw/s1600/accuracy.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S8qcCScG9Sk/U4VvX6jD4rI/AAAAAAAAOlY/ugOZ_74W8iw/s1600/accuracy.png"" height=""292"" width=""640"" /></a></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>The models can predict PUE with 99.6 percent accuracy.</i></div>
<br />
By pushing the boundaries of data center operations, Jim and his team have opened up a new world of opportunities to improve data center performance and reduce energy consumption. He lays out his approach in the white paper, so other data center operators that dabble in machine learning (or who have a resident genius around who wants to figure it out) can give it a try as well. <br />

2161141690988329759,,Google Blogs,2014-05-27T19:01:00-07:00,Just press go: designing a self-driving vehicle ,"Ever since we <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/what-were-driving-at.html"">started the Google self-driving car project</a>, we’ve been working toward the goal of vehicles that can shoulder the entire burden of driving. Just imagine: You can take a trip downtown at lunchtime without a 20-minute buffer to find parking.  Seniors can keep their freedom even if they can’t keep their car keys. And drunk and distracted driving? History.  <br />
<br />
We’re now exploring what fully self-driving vehicles would look like by building some prototypes; they’ll be designed to operate safely and autonomously without requiring human intervention. They won’t have a steering wheel, accelerator pedal, or brake pedal… because they don’t need them.  Our software and sensors do all the work.  The vehicles will be very basic—we want to learn from them and adapt them as quickly as possible—but they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button. And that's an important step toward improving road safety and transforming mobility for millions of people. <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/CqSDWoAhvLU"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
It was inspiring to start with a blank sheet of paper and ask, “What should be different about this kind of vehicle?” We started with the most important thing: safety. They have sensors that remove blind spots, and they can detect objects out to a distance of more than two football fields in all directions, which is especially helpful on <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-latest-chapter-for-self-driving-car.html"">busy streets with lots of intersections</a>. And we’ve capped the speed of these first vehicles at 25 mph. On the inside, we’ve designed for learning, not luxury, so we’re light on creature comforts, but we’ll have two seats (with seatbelts), a space for passengers’ belongings, buttons to start and stop, and a screen that shows the route—and that’s about it.<br />

<i>A very early version of our prototype vehicle, and an artistic rendering of our vehicle</i></div>
<br />
We’re planning to build about a hundred prototype vehicles, and later this summer, our safety drivers will start testing early versions of these vehicles that have manual controls. If all goes well, we’d like to run a small pilot program here in California in the next couple of years. We’re going to learn a lot from this experience, and if the technology develops as we hope, we’ll work with partners to bring this technology into the world safely. <br />
<br />
If you’d like to follow updates about the project and share your thoughts, please join us on our <a href=""http://plus.google.com/+SelfDrivingCar"">new Google+ page</a>. We’re looking forward to learning more about what passengers want in a vehicle where their number one job is to kick back, relax, and enjoy the ride.  <br />

<b>Basketball’s surprise star </b><br />
NBA fans met a fresh face this week at the NBA Draft Lottery. The designated representative of the Milwaukee Bucks was <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Mallory+Edens&amp;std=20140520&amp;pn=p1#a=20140520-Mallory+Edens"">Mallory Edens</a>, the daughter of the team’s new co-owner. And, even though the Bucks slid to the #2 pick (after having the best odds to land #1), it seems Mallory pretty much won the Lottery anyway.  And she wasn’t the only one who became an overnight sensation at the NBA’s annual festival of ping pong balls and sealed envelopes: searchers <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=mallory%20edens&amp;date=today%203-m&amp;cmpt=q"">also looked for information</a> about [anjali ranadive], the daughter of the Sacramento Kings’ owner, who was also at the draft.<br />

Good design attracts our attention with its beauty, doesn’t need a user manual, is universally understood by anyone in the world, and is simple without sacrificing functionality. <br />
<br />
In 1974, the world gave us one such piece of perfect design—the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube"">Rubik's Cube</a>. Budapest-based educator and inventor Ernő Rubik created the puzzle originally to help his students better understand spatial geometry. Released to the public in the 1980s, it quickly became an international obsession, bigger than hairspray and breakdancing combined. But the Rubik’s Cube is more than just a toy; it’s a puzzle waiting to be solved and a question waiting to be answered. Over the past 40 years, the cube has puzzled, frustrated, and fascinated so many of us, and has helped spark an interest in math and problem solving in millions of kids. That’s part of why so many of us at Google <a href=""http://www.cube20.org/"">love the cube</a>, and why we're so excited to celebrate its 40th birthday this year. <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/W1K2jdjLhbo"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
As everyone knows (right??), there are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube#Permutations"">519 quintillion permutations</a> for the Rubik’s cube, so May 19 seemed like a fine day to celebrate its 40th anniversary. To kick things off, we’re using some of our favorite web technologies (HTML5 and Three.js among others) to bring the cube to the world in the form of <a href=""http://goo.gl/VMKxLX"">one of our most technically ambitious doodles yet</a>. You can twist and turn it by dragging along its sides, but with full respect to all the speedcubers out there, we’ve included keyboard shortcuts:<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

Using the same technology that’s behind the doodle, we built <a href=""http://chrome.com/cubelab"">Chrome Cube Lab</a>, a series of Chrome Experiments by designers and technologists that reinterpret Rubik’s puzzle with the full power of the web. Create your own music with experiments <a href=""http://808cube.com/"">808Cube</a> and <a href=""http://synthcu.be/"">SynthCube</a>; make a custom, shareable cube of your own photos and GIFs with <a href=""http://www.imagecu.be/"">ImageCube</a>; or send a scrambly message with the <a href=""http://www.chrome.com/cubelab/type"">Type Cube</a>. You can visit some of these experiments at the Liberty Science Center’s&nbsp;<a href=""http://brc.lsc.org/"">Beyond Rubik’s Cube</a>&nbsp;exhibition, and if you'd like to explore the cube even further, consider <a href=""https://chrome.com/cubelab#participate"">borrowing the cube’s source code</a> to build an experiment of your own.<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoy getting to know the cube from a few new angles.<br />

Millions of people rely on public transit to get around. That’s why, since 2007, we’ve worked to include public transit routes and schedules in Google Maps. In fact, buses, trains, trams and subways included in Google Maps travel 200 million kilometers every day—that’s the equivalent of driving every single road in the world three times!<sup>2</sup><br />

Today, Google Maps is helping you get around on public transit even more easily with these additions:<br />
<ul>
<li>We’ve added <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/gbpublictransport/blog"">every single transit route</a> in <b>Great Britain</b> to Google Maps—making it easier to get anywhere from Land’s End to John O’Groats.</li>
<li>On the other side of the globe, <b>Vancouverites</b> looking for sun can now get real-time updates on whether a bus to Kits is faster than one to Third Beach.</li>
<li>In <b>Chicago</b>, Cubs fans can now zip to and from Wrigley Field, armed with the real-time information they need to hop on a bus and avoid congestion on Lake Shore Drive.</li>
<li>And finally, just in time for the games, we’ve <a href=""http://googlebrasilblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/google-transit-traz-dados-sobre.html"">recently added</a> transit information for every host city in <b>Brazil</b>. Can you say “GOOOAAALLLLL?!”</li>

Since then, technology has opened up a world of new educational opportunities, from simple searches to <a href=""http://translate.google.com/"">Google Translate</a> (and our backpacks have gotten a lot lighter). But it can be hard to find time and the means to practice a new language. So when the Web Speech API made it <a href=""http://chrome.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/hello-browser.html"">possible to speak to our phones, tablets and computers</a>, I got curious about whether this technology could help people learn a language more easily. <br />
<br />
That’s the idea behind <a href=""http://chrome.com/spellup"">Spell Up</a>, a new word game and Chrome Experiment that helps you improve your English using your voice—and a modern browser, of course. It’s like a virtual spelling bee, with a twist.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ICm0at4N2OM?rel=0"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
We worked with game designers and teachers to make Spell Up both fun and educational. The goal of the game is to correctly spell the words you hear and stack them to build the highest word tower you can—letter by letter, word by word. The higher the tower gets, the more difficult the word challenges: You’ll be asked to pronounce words correctly, solve word jumbles and guess mystery words. You can earn bonuses and coins to level up faster.<br />
<br />
Spell Up works best in Chrome on your <a href=""http://google.com/chrome"">computer</a> and on <a href=""http://g.co/ChromeApp"">Android phones and tablets</a>. (It also works on iPhones and iPads, but you’ll need to type rather than talk.) Whether you’re just learning English or you’re already a pro, <a href=""http://chrome.com/spellup"">check it out</a>! And if you’re a teacher, we encourage you to try it out in your classroom. <br />

<br />
<b>Mint juleps and margaritas</b><br />
This past week people across the country celebrated several long-held traditions and some newer ones. With the 140th “Run for the Roses” on Saturday, there were more than 2 million searches on the subject of the Kentucky Derby, including research on [kentucky derby time] and [kentucky derby horses]. (We’re partial to <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+google/posts/8FtUHFo4GV2"">derby fashion</a>.) Then, on Sunday, nerds everywhere celebrated what’s come to be known as “Star Wars Day,” thus named because the date lends itself to the pun “May the Fourth be with you.” According to search data at least, the unofficial holiday has been <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=may%20the%20fourth%20be%20with%20you&amp;geo=US&amp;date=1%2F2014%2012m%2C%201%2F2013%2012m%2C%201%2F2012%2012m%2C%201%2F2011%2012m&amp;cmpt=date"">getting bigger every year</a>. And finally, Monday’s Cinco de Mayo inspired lots of <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=sinko%20de%20mayo"">pranks</a>, jokes, and more than a few people looking up the <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+google/posts/WfZdgCM3tcq"">history</a> of the holiday.<br />

<b>Red carpet moments and capital celebs</b><br />
At this week’s <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=met%20gala&amp;geo=US&amp;cmpt=q"">Met Gala</a>, the annual fundraising event for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Beyonce and <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Blake+Lively&amp;std=20140506&amp;pn=p1#a=20140506-Blake+Lively"">Blake Lively</a> turned heads and inspired searches. And though searchers were interested in the White House Correspondents Dinner, it was old, not new, Beltway gossip that dominated this week. In a “Vanity Fair” essay, <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Monica+Lewinsky&amp;std=20140506&amp;pn=p1#a=20140506-Monica+Lewinsky"">Monica Lewinsky</a> broke a 10-year media silence to talk about life since the affair that made her a household name. Search interest in Lewinsky subsequently jumped to the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=monica%20lewinsky&amp;geo=US&amp;cmpt=q"">highest point ever</a> since 2004 (the time period for which data is available) as people looked for more information on the original story as well as [lewinsky now].<br />

<b>On the issues</b><br />
The phrase “Bring Back our Girls” became a rallying cry to raise awareness about a group of nearly 300 school girls abducted in Nigeria in April. A number of leaders, including Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton, have raised their voices in support of the campaign. <br />
<br />
On a completely different viral note, Jimmy Kimmel hit the streets asking people “what is gluten?” This <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdJFE1sp4Fw&amp;noredirect=1"">now viral YouTube video</a> has left many people laughing at the responses, as well as looking up the definition of gluten, and related issues such as celiac disease, for themselves. <br />

We hope you took time to <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+google/posts/XT8ndE8mpdG"">thank a teacher</a> for Teacher Appreciation Week.

It’s no coincidence, then, that it’s also home to some of the most creative entrepreneurs out there, which is why we’re pleased to welcome <a href=""http://capitalfactory.com/"">Capital Factory</a>, an Austin-based incubator and co-working space for startups, to the Google for Entrepreneurs <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/09/igniting-new-network-meet-our-tech-hub.html"">Tech Hub Network</a>. The city’s thriving startup community and deep bench of engineering talent, combined with its natural creativity and eclecticism, make it the perfect place to expand. <br />
<br />
Capital Factory is the eighth space to join the Network, a group of partner organizations across the U.S. that does everything from hosting accelerator programs for talented developers to providing desks for entrepreneurs. Google for Entrepreneurs provides funding to all the hubs and give them access to mentorship opportunities and Google products. <br />
<br />
In just over six months, the Tech Hub Network is already having a dramatic effect on entrepreneurs around North America. Seventy-one percent of startups say their hub is having a significant impact on their growth, and companies from the Network have raised more than $50 million and created 1,200 jobs since becoming members. Just last month, we hosted a Demo Day for these hubs, where 10 startups raised millions of dollars to help grow their businesses. <br />
<br />
To give these entrepreneurs an even greater boost going forward, starting today anyone who works in one of the eight tech hubs or Google’s  Campus <a href=""http://www.campuslondon.com/"">London</a> and <a href=""https://www.campustelaviv.com/"">Tel Aviv</a> will be able to work for free from the other member spaces when traveling. This will give startups a home base when they’re on the road, and the chance to spread and exchange ideas from city to city.<br />

Not too long ago, Google was just a small startup in a garage. Now that we’ve grown up a bit, we want to give others a place where they can work on their ideas, and feed off each other’s creativity and ingenuity. Capital Factory is no exception. So, get your boots on, Austin entrepreneurs—we can’t wait to see how your growing startup community plays its part in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Austin_Weird"">keeping Austin weird</a>. <br />

But with today’s technology it doesn’t have to be this way. Many teachers and professors have found ways to use technology to be better educators and avoid busy work. We spent the past year working closely with many educators to understand the systems they use to simplify their workloads, so they can get back to doing what they love—teaching.<br />
<br />
Today, in honor of <a href=""http://www.ed.gov/blog/2014/05/thankateacher-and-share-on-teacher-appreciation-day/"">Teacher Appreciation Day</a>, we’re announcing a preview of <a href=""http://google.com/edu/classroom"">Classroom</a>, a new, free tool in the <a href=""http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/education/"">Google Apps for Education</a> suite. It helps teachers create and organize assignments quickly, provide feedback efficiently, and communicate with their classes with ease. Classroom is based on the principle that educational tools should be simple and easy to use, and is designed to give teachers more time to teach and students more time to learn. <br />
<br />
With Classroom, you'll be able to:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Create and collect assignments: </b>Classroom weaves together Google Docs, Drive and Gmail to help teachers create and collect assignments paperlessly. They can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback to individual students.</li>
<li><b>Improve class communications: </b>Teachers can make announcements, ask questions and comment with students in real time—improving communication inside and outside of class.</li>
<li><b>Stay organized: </b>Classroom automatically creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student. Students can easily see what’s due on their Assignments page.</li>
</ul>
<br />
We know that protecting your students’ privacy is critical. Like the rest of our Apps for Education services, Classroom <a href=""http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2014/04/protecting-students-with-google-apps.html"">contains no ads</a>, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes, and is free for schools.<br />

Starting today, teachers and professors can <a href=""https://classroom.google.com/signup"">apply for a preview</a> of Classroom. Based on the requests we receive, we’ll be inviting a limited number of educators to try Classroom in about a month. By September, Classroom will be available to any school using Google Apps for Education. Since we want to make sure Classroom plays well with others, if you’re a developer or partner, <a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/1lHsBHFWQVB_UPlDlzxo8NFbuqNlFWhHzGtxESv1Csm4/viewform"">sign up</a> to learn more about integrating with Classroom.<br />
<br />
We’ve been working with more than a dozen pilot schools and universities to try out Classroom and provide feedback—and we can’t thank them enough. We can’t wait to hear your feedback, and to work together to make Classroom even better.<br />

<b>Searching for romance</b><br />
It’s the end of George as we know him. Saturday, word got out that longtime bachelor George Clooney was engaged to his girlfriend, Amal Alamuddin. Alamuddin is a respected human rights lawyer in Britain, but she’s not—or wasn’t—a household name, and many people turned to search to learn more about the woman who captured Clooney’s heart. While they were at it, they looked for information on actress Talia Balsam, who was married to George in the early 90’s (for those of you paying attention, that’s pre-<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Ross"">Doug Ross</a>!). In other celebrity couple news, Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas have reportedly broken up. So, if you’re disappointed that George is off the market, there’s still hope for women around the world wishing to marry a royal.<br />

<b>A historic week for the NBA</b><br />
NBA commissioner Adam Silver made league history this week when he fined Clippers owner Donald Sterling and banned him from the league for recent comments. <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=adam%20silver&amp;date=today%203-m&amp;cmpt=q"">Millions of searches</a> followed, and terms like [adam silver comments], [adam silver sterling], [adam sterling clippers] immediately climbed more than 1,000 percent. <br />
<br />
<b>The fetch is strong with this one</b><br />
On Wednesday, we wore pink in celebration of the 10th anniversary of Tina Fey’s “Mean Girls.” The movie that gave us “fetch” was the subject of <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=mean%20girls&amp;date=1%2F2014%2012m%2C%201%2F2004%2012m&amp;cmpt=date"">so many searches</a>, quizzes (searches for [mean girls quiz] were up 350 percent) and retrospectives that even Cady Heron might have trouble adding them up. And though rumors of a [mean girls reunion] (up 850 percent) are apparently false, that can’t exactly be said of another movie on searchers’ minds this week: “Star Wars.” A photo revealing the cast of J.J. Abrams’ “Episode VII” showed original stars Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and more seated alongside new faces like John Boyega, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. The new cast members were on the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=john%20boyega%2C%20daisy%20ridley%2C%20domhnall%20gleeson%2C%20adam%20driver&amp;cmpt=q"">top of the search charts</a> quicker than the Millennium Falcon could make the Kessel Run.

But while we can’t deny Emma’s spoken-word skills, we’ve got a soft spot for two other playful phrases that made the zeitgeist this week. On Saturday, searchers learned that [zonkey] was not an adjective for how you feel after a red-eye, but actually a rare zebra/donkey cross born last week in Mexico.

And while the Drive app is a convenient place to store your stuff, we want to make it easier for you to quickly find, edit and create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations on the go. Starting today, you can download new, standalone mobile apps for <a href=""http://www.google.com/docs/about/?utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=launch"" target=""_blank"">Docs</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/sheets/about/?utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=launch"" target=""_blank"">Sheets</a>—with <a href=""http://www.google.com/slides/about/?utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=launch"" target=""_blank"">Slides</a> coming soon. Need to find a spreadsheet? Go to the Sheets app. Need to create a document? Go to the Docs app. They’re all right there at your fingertips.<br />
<br />
When you open the new apps, you’ll see your most recently edited files, which means less time searching and scrolling.<br />
<a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JX3UrCFnrmE/U1lWIaqKmYI/AAAAAAAABdg/O4YygKs4oiU/s1600/docs_nexus7_open_0424b.gif"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JX3UrCFnrmE/U1lWIaqKmYI/AAAAAAAABdg/O4YygKs4oiU/s1600/docs_nexus7_open_0424b.gif"" /></a><br />
The apps also come with offline support built in, so you can easily view, edit and create files without an Internet connection. Now, if you have a brilliant idea for a best-selling novel while traipsing through the Amazonian rainforest (or you know, something more probable, like during flight takeoff)...no problem. You can jot down your idea in the Docs app on your phone, even when you’re offline. <br />

If you don’t have&nbsp;time now, over the next few days you’ll be prompted to download the apps when you go to edit or create a document or spreadsheet in your Drive app. And of course, you’ll still be able to use the Drive app to view and organize all of your documents, spreadsheets, presentations, photos and more.<br />
<br />
So enjoy the Amazon—we’re looking forward to buying that novel someday. And in the meantime, just remember: even if a crocodile eats your phone, your files are safe in the cloud! <br />

For many students, environmental issues were top of mind, resulting in impressive and artistic doodles depicting water and air purification or turning garbage into flowers. Another common theme was really smart robots; they clean up garbage or help students with their homework. Others created possible solutions for solving obesity or eliminating world hunger. And we saw some thoughtful ideas around time travel and goggles that help you see the world from another person’s point of view so you can truly understand them. <br />
<br />
From more than 100,000 creative ideas, we’ve selected the best one from each state with the help of our <a href=""http://www.google.com/doodle4google/guests.html"">guest judges</a>. Today, we’re celebrating the 50 state winners—little ones just six years old to high school seniors—at their schools from Fort Paine, Ala. to Moorcroft, Wyo., and from Anchorage, Alaska to Plant City, Fla. We’ll reveal the winning artists in front of their classmates, teachers and parents and, in some places, their local mayors or elected officials.<br />
<br />
Now it’s your turn to cast a vote for your favorite Doodle. Starting today through May 9, you can go to the <a href=""http://www.google.com/doodle4google/vote.html"">Doodle 4 Google site</a> to help select one winner for each age group. On May 21, we’ll host all 50 state winners at our headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., where we’ll reveal the five age group finalists as well as the national Doodle 4 Google winner.<br />

4503950162350337601,,Google Blogs,2014-04-28T05:00:00-07:00,The latest chapter for the self-driving car: mastering city street driving  ,"Jaywalking pedestrians. Cars lurching out of hidden driveways. Double-parked delivery trucks blocking your lane and your view. At a busy time of day, a typical city street can leave even experienced drivers sweaty-palmed and irritable. We all dream of a world in which city centers are freed of congestion from cars <a href=""http://shoup.bol.ucla.edu/CruisingForParkingAccess.pdf"">circling for parking</a>&nbsp;(PDF) and have fewer intersections <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chqEoZ3UMZA"">made dangerous by distracted drivers</a>. That’s why over the last year we’ve shifted the focus of the Google self-driving car project onto mastering city street driving.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3_NariJ0AGk/U13q_wkqioI/AAAAAAAAOcg/RR4vTgn1ROc/s1600/Iconic+image+for+city+streets.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3_NariJ0AGk/U13q_wkqioI/AAAAAAAAOcg/RR4vTgn1ROc/s1600/Iconic+image+for+city+streets.jpg"" width=""550"" /></a></div>
Since our <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-self-driving-car-logs-more-miles-on.html"">last update</a>, we’ve logged thousands of miles on the streets of our hometown of Mountain View, Calif. A mile of city driving is much more complex than a mile of freeway driving, with hundreds of different objects moving according to different rules of the road in a small area. We’ve improved our software so it can detect hundreds of distinct objects simultaneously—pedestrians, buses, a stop sign held up by a crossing guard, or a cyclist making gestures that indicate a possible turn. A self-driving vehicle can pay attention to all of these things in a way that a human physically can’t—and it never gets tired or distracted.<br />
<br />
Here’s a video showing how our vehicle navigates some common scenarios near the Googleplex: <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/dk3oc1Hr62g?rel=0"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
As it turns out, what looks chaotic and random on a city street to the human eye is actually fairly predictable to a computer. As we’ve encountered thousands of different situations, we’ve built software models of what to expect, from the likely (a car stopping at a red light) to the unlikely (blowing through it). We still have lots of problems to solve, including teaching the car to drive more streets in Mountain View before we tackle another town, but thousands of situations on city streets that would have stumped us two years ago can now be navigated autonomously.<br />
<br />
Our vehicles have now logged nearly 700,000 autonomous miles, and with every passing mile we’re growing more optimistic that we’re heading toward an achievable goal—a vehicle that operates fully without human intervention. <br />

<br />
<b>The games we play</b><br />
The NBA and NHL playoffs both kicked off in earnest this week, and searches for hockey and basketball topics lit up the scoreboard. In fact, the Chicago Blackhawks occupied a post in <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends"">Google’s Hot Searches</a> list<i> every day</i> but one since last Friday. The defending Stanley Cup champions are playing a tight (and, as of Wednesday, tied) series against the St. Louis Blues; they also drew controversy this weekend when stories emerged of the Blackhawks taunting Blues captain David Backes after a hit that got the Hawks’ Brent Seabrook suspended. <br />
<br />
In the NBA, it was all about the big plays. Searches for the OKC Thunder’s Kevin Durant peaked after he made a ridiculous four-point play while (and I don’t use this word lightly) literally falling out of bounds on Tuesday. The last time Durant came close to this level of search interest was <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=kevin%20durant&amp;date=1%2F2014%2012m&amp;cmpt=q"">on January 30</a>, after a 12-game 30+ point scoring streak. And the Portland Trail Blazers’ <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=LaMarcus+Aldridge&amp;std=20140423&amp;pn=p1#a=20140423-LaMarcus+Aldridge"">LaMarcus Aldridge</a> was on fire on the court and on Google, scoring more than 40 points in his team’s first two playoff games against the Houston Rockets… on the road—making him one of only three players ever to do so. On a more somber note, searches were also high for longtime sideline reporter <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Craig+Sager&amp;std=20140420&amp;pn=p1#a=20140420-Craig+Sager"">Craig Sager</a>, who revealed on Sunday that he has been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia.<br />

And during Monday’s Boston Marathon (a trending topic both this week and last), <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F04723g&amp;date=1%2F2014%2012m&amp;cmpt=q"">Meb Keflezighi</a> became the first American to win the race in more than 30 years, making him a “breakout,” with nearly 1,000% increase in search interest over the last year on Google Search.<br />
<br />
<b>Stranger than fiction</b><br />
Alongside searches for Easter and Earth Day, there were a few unconventional celebrations this week. Dyngus Day, a Polish-American holiday taking place on Easter Monday and similar to Poland’s Śmigus-Dyngus and Hungary’s Vízbevető, was a top topic in search on Monday (O.K., so it wasn’t <i>the</i> top topic, but it was top of mind for many). <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Amigus-Dyngus"">Traditionally celebrated</a> by boys <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1436&amp;bih=748&amp;q=smigus+dyngus"">throwing water</a> over girls, in the U.S. Dyngus Day celebrations include parades, traditional foods and polka music. Whatever its origins, interest in Dyngus Day <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=dyngus%20day&amp;date=1%2F2014%2012m%2C%201%2F2013%2012m%2C%201%2F2012%2012m&amp;cmpt=date"">has been growing steadily the past two years</a> since barely registering on Search in 2012.<br />
<br />
What the… powdered alcohol?! That’s what some people were thinking when they searched for [<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Palcohol&amp;std=20140421&amp;pn=p1#a=20140421-Palcohol"">Palcohol</a>], a powder that turns water into alcoholic drinks. It was approved by U.S. regulators earlier in the month, but this week the decision was rescinded. And when a 15-year-old boy caught a ride from San Jose, Calif., to Hawaii in an airplane <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=wheel%20well&amp;date=today%203-m&amp;cmpt=q"">wheel well</a>, stunned searchers came to Google looking for images of wheel wells to understand how someone might survive such a feat—especially without the beverage cart.<br />

Yesterday we announced <a href=""http://googlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/an-earth-day-treat-lots-of-renewable.html"">our biggest renewable energy purchase yet</a>: an agreement with our Iowa utility partners to supply our data center facilities there with up to 407 megawatts of wind energy.<br />
<br />
Today, we’re taking another step towards a clean energy future with a major new investment. Together with <a href=""http://us.sunpower.com/"">SunPower Corporation</a> we’re creating a new $250 million fund to help finance the purchase of residential rooftop solar systems—making it easier for thousands of households across the U.S. to go solar. Essentially, this is how it works: Using the fund ($100 million from Google and $150 million from SunPower), we buy the solar panel systems. Then we lease them to homeowners at a cost that’s typically lower than their normal electricity bill. So by participating in this program, you don’t just help the environment—you can also save money.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>A home sporting SunPower solar panels</i></div>
<br />
SunPower delivers solar to residential, utility and commercial customers and also manufacturers its own solar cells and panels.They’re known for having high-quality, high reliability panels which can generate up to 50 percent more power per unit area, with guaranteed performance and lower degradation over time. That means that you can install fewer solar panels to get the same amount of energy. And SunPower both makes the panels and manages the installation, so the process is seamless. <br />
<br />
This is our <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/energy/investments/"">16th renewable energy investment</a> and our third residential rooftop solar investment (the others being with <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/helping-homeowners-harness-sun.html"">Solar City</a> and <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/taking-in-more-sun-with-clean-power.html"">Clean Power Finance</a>). Overall we’ve invested more than $1 billion in 16 renewable energy projects around the world, and we’re always on the hunt for new opportunities to make more renewable energy available to more people—Earth Day and every day. <br />

You’ll find one of those people in the tall grasslands of Nepal’s <a href=""http://www.chitwannationalpark.gov.np/"">Chitwan National Park</a>, where Sabita Malla, a senior research officer at World Wildlife Fund (WWF), is hard at work protecting rhinos and Bengal tigers from poaching. She spends her days collecting data about wildlife in order to track the animals, assess threats, and provide support where needed. Now, she’s getting help from something a bit unexpected: <a href=""http://www.google.com/glass/start/"">Google Glass</a>. <br />
<br />
Last year, WWF started exploring how smart eyewear could help further its conservation mission in the Arctic and the Amazon as part of the <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+GoogleGlass/posts/MQeUzEngiBM"">Giving through Glass</a> Explorer program. Now they’ve brought it to Nepal to see how it could help monitor wild rhinos. Take a peek: <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/0-jnefZuOhA?rel=0"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
Rhino monitoring can be a slow process, especially in habitats with tricky terrain, but data collection is crucial for making the right conservation decisions. Most parts of Chitwan National Park are inaccessible to vehicles, so Sabita and her team ride in on elephants, and have been collecting health and habitat data using pencil and paper.<br />
<br />
Now custom-built Glassware (the Glass version of apps) called Field Notes can help Sabita do her work hands-free instead of gathering data in a notebook. That’s helpful for both accuracy and safety when you’re on an elephant. Using voice commands, Sabita and other researchers can take photos and videos, and map a rhino’s location, size, weight, and other notable characteristics. The notes collected can also be automatically uploaded to a shared doc back at the office, making it easier to collaborate with other researchers, and potentially a lot faster than typing up handwritten notes.<br />
<br />
This is just one example of a nonprofit exploring how Glass can make their critical work easier. Today, we’re looking for more ideas from you.<br />
<br />
If you work at a nonprofit and have an idea for how to make more of a difference with Glass, share your ideas at <a href=""http://g.co/givingthroughglass"">g.co/givingthroughglass</a> by 11:59 PDT on May 20, 2014. Five U.S.-based nonprofits will get a Glass device, a trip to a Google office for training, a $25,000 grant, and help from Google developers to make your Glass project a reality. <br />

<br />
<b>From afikomen to 1040EZ</b><br />
People were looking for information on Palm Sunday and Good Friday ahead of Easter; <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=palm%20sunday%2C%20%2Fm%2F05ngt2%2C%20maundy%20thursday%2C%20good%20friday&amp;date=4%2F2014%201m&amp;cmpt=q"">searches for both days</a> were even higher than searches for the Pope himself. Turning to another religious tradition, with Passover beginning on Monday we saw <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=seder%2C%20%2Fm%2F0585y%2C%20brisket%2C%20charoset&amp;date=4%2F2014%201m&amp;cmpt=q"">searches</a> rise over 100 percent for Seder staples like [charoset recipe], [brisket passover] and of course [matzo balls]. Alongside these celebrations, U.S. citizens observed another annual rite of spring: taxes were due on April 15, leading to a <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F02l0q9d%2C%20%2Fm%2F03z19%2C%20taxes&amp;date=3%2F2014%202m&amp;cmpt=q"">rise in searches</a> for [turbotax free], [irs] and (whoops) [turbotax extension]. <br />

But what made this year different from all other years? A rare lunar eclipse known as the “blood moon,” when the Earth’s shadow covers the moon, making it look red, and which occurred on Tuesday. There were <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Blood+Moon&amp;std=20140414&amp;pn=p1#a=20140414-Blood+Moon"">more than 5 million searches</a> on the topic, as people were eager to learn more. (Hint: if you missed seeing the blood moon this time around, keep your eyes on the sky in October. This is the first lunar eclipse in a “lunar tetrad,” a series of four total lunar eclipses each taking place six lunar months apart.) <br />

<b>Say goodbye and say hello</b><br />
This week marked the first anniversary of last year’s <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F018x6y&amp;date=today%207-d&amp;cmpt=q"">Boston Marathon</a> bombing, and commemorations led searches for the term [boston strong] to rise once again. And just yesterday, we were saddened by the passing of <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Gabriel+Garcia+Marquez&amp;std=20140417&amp;pn=p1#a=20140417-Gabriel+Garcia+Marquez"">Gabriel Garcia Marquez</a>, the Colombian writer best known for his masterpiece “100 Years of Solitude”—not to mention responsible for high schoolers across the U.S. knowing the term “magical realism.” On a happier note, former First Daughter <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Chelsea+Clinton&amp;std=20140417&amp;pn=p1#a=20140417-Chelsea+Clinton"">Chelsea Clinton</a> announced she’s expecting.<br />
<br />
<b>Entertainment that makes you go ZOMG</b><br />
“Game of Thrones” fans—at least those who hadn’t read the books—were treated to a bombshell in this past Sunday’s episode when (<b>spoiler alert</b>) yet another wedding turned murderous. Searches for [who killed joffrey] <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=who+killed+Joffrey&amp;std=20140414&amp;pn=p1#a=20140414-who+killed+Joffrey"">skyrocketed</a> as people struggled to process the loss of the boy king we love to hate. On the more sedate end of the Sunday TV spectrum, we welcomed back AMC’s “Mad Men,” which continues to provide viewers with plenty of innuendo, allusion and fashion to chew on—and <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Mad+Men&amp;std=20140413&amp;pn=p1#a=20140413-Mad+Men"">search</a> for—in between episodes. <br />
<br />
The trailer for the highly anticipated film version of “Gone Girl” dropped this week—vaulting <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=gone%20girl%2C%20the%20fault%20in%20our%20stars&amp;date=4%2F2014%201m&amp;cmpt=q"">searches</a> for [gone girl trailer] nearly 1,000 percent—as did a <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=The+Fault+In+Our+Stars&amp;std=20140414&amp;pn=p1#a=20140414-The+Fault+In+Our+Stars"">clip</a> from another book-to-movie remake, “The Fault in Our Stars.” Between these two films we expect no dry eyes in June and no intact fingernails come October. At least we’ve got something funny to look forward to: as news broke this week that Fox 2000 is developing a sequel to the 1993 comedy classic ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Mara+Wilson&amp;std=20140417&amp;pn=p1#a=20140417-Mara+Wilson"">searches</a> on the subject have since spiked. <br />

In this program, Google provides funding and support for experts to create hands-on professional development training in CS education for K-12 educators. The goal is to arm teachers with the knowledge they need to help their students succeed in the field. The program has already trained more than 12,000 teachers, and reached more than 600,000 students—and we’ve gotten great feedback over the years (a 95% satisfaction rate!).<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""390"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/smlR9t2dmBU"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
It’s been a great success, but there is still much more to do. So this year, we’re taking the first steps toward extending CS4HS across the globe. We’re piloting CS4HS projects in Latin America for the first time—an area where computer science education is often mistaken for computer literacy (think word processing, typing, or changing settings on your operating system rather than robotics or coding a game). We’re also introducing <a href=""https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zJt3tkOju99Y.kRuufeJdd5aE"">eight new online workshops</a>, so teachers no longer need to be located near a CS4HS event to get quality training.<br />
<br />
It’s not just the “where” we’re expanding, but the “when,” as well. We’re now providing new resources for teachers to get ongoing, year-round help. Our Google+ Community page hosts Hangouts on Air with CS industry leaders, Googlers, and top educators on a regular basis. And we’ve added a new <a href=""http://cs4hs.com/resources/"">Resources page</a> with online workshops, tutorials and information on computational thinking, robotics and more. Finally, if you happen to be in the neighborhood at the right time, sign up for one of our in-person workshops available around the world in these locations: <insert map="""" visual=""""><br />

In this post, Dr. Goodall shares her thoughts on how today’s technology can enable more people around the world to make a difference in their communities. Join Dr. Goodall for a celebratory <a href=""http://www.janegoodall.org/80yearsofjane"">Birthday Hangout on Air</a> today at 11 a.m. PDT/2 p.m. EDT.</i> -Ed.<br />
<br />
When I first set foot on the shores of <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lake+Tanganyika/@-6.0787556,30.1304769,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x19a364ddf9976709:0xb116148f7c582969"">Lake Tanganyika</a> in 1960 to study chimpanzee behavior, I carried with me notebooks, pencils and a pair of second-hand binoculars. I was, at the time, a young woman with no scientific training, but had a strong passion for learning about animals in Africa. In later years I founded the <a href=""http://www.janegoodall.org/"">Jane Goodall Institute</a>, dedicated to preserving the habitat of chimpanzees and other animals worldwide.<br />

<br />
Today, the mapping technology available to all of us is completely changing the potential for animal and environmental research. My trip in 1960 would have looked quite different today. You have much more power at your fingertips, and you don't even have to leave your home. Tools like <a href=""http://www.google.com/earth/"">Google Earth</a> let you visit the shores of Lake Tanganyika with just a few keystrokes. And in <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gombe+National+Park/@-4.6999694,29.5994323,740a,35y,90h,78.01t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x19bf1b2712c54bc1:0x7f153233f5d0b2ee"">Gombe</a>, local villagers are using Android smartphones and tablets, in conjunction with Google Maps Engine and Earth Engine, to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNXv8EEs0P8&amp;list=PLWw80tqUZ5J9CY3A3Xhz7UXkufNOmnODr"">monitor changes in the forest habitat</a> that affect chimpanzee populations. Technology makes it so easy for people to find and share information and to understand the world around them. And once we understand, we can start to foster positive change.  <br />

That’s one of the reasons we started the <a href=""http://rootsandshoots.org/"">Roots &amp; Shoots</a> program to connect young people with the knowledge and tools they need to solve problems in their communities. The projects undertaken by these young people help them learn important science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills while developing real leadership capabilities. Today, Roots &amp; Shoots is launching a new <a href=""http://rootsandshoots.org/mapping"">community mapping tutorial</a> for young people to help them use digital mapping technology to identify and address needs in their community. If you’re an educator, we offer online professional development to help you fit our youth leadership model into your classroom and curriculum.

<br />
Today, on my 80th birthday, my wish is for young people around the world to think about the ways you can use technology to learn more about the wonderful world we share. Then, to take action, and inspire others to do the same. You have the power to do so much more than I did in 1960, to spark change I could only imagine back then.  And you can do it no matter where in the world you are.  <br />

From being the first company to <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/transparency-report-shedding-more-light.html"">disclose information about National Security Letters</a> to fighting for the ability to <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/02/shedding-some-light-on-foreign.html"">publish more about FISA requests</a>, we’ve continually advocated for your right to know. <br />
<br />
Today, we’re updating our <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/"">Transparency Report</a> for the ninth time. This updated Report details the number of government requests we received for user information in criminal investigations during the second half of 2013. Government requests for user information in criminal cases have increased by about 120 percent since we first began publishing these numbers in 2009. Though our number of users has grown throughout the time period, we’re also seeing more and more governments start to exercise their authority to make requests. <br />
<br />
We consistently push back against overly broad requests for your personal information, but it’s also important for laws to explicitly protect you from government overreach. That’s why we’re working alongside eight other companies to push for <a href=""http://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/"">surveillance reform</a>, including more transparency. We’ve all been sharing best practices about how to report the requests we receive, and as a result our Transparency Report now includes governments that made less than 30 requests during a six-month reporting period, in addition to those that made 30+ requests. <br />
<br />
Also, people have been asking about how we respond to search warrants in the U.S., so we’ve created an entertaining <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeKKHxcJfh0"">video</a> to explain in plain language how this process works. We apply the same rigorous standards presented in this video to every request we receive, regardless of type. <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/MeKKHxcJfh0"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
You deserve to know when and how governments request user information online, and we’ll keep fighting to make sure that’s the case.<br />

Over 10 weeks, Fellows work on projects ranging from building interactive news apps to researching stories, finding data and writing code. In this post, one of last year’s Fellows, Jan Lauren Boyles, shares her perspective on the benefits of the program and what this year’s Fellows stand to get out of it. </i>-Ed.<br />
<br />
At first, I thought it was just my imagination.<br />
<br />
In the middle of my exams for my doctorate at American University last year, I got a call from the <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/"">Pew Research Center</a> offering me a Google Journalism Fellowship. Low on sleep, my first thought: ""Was this offer all just a reverie, rendered by my foggy mind?""<br />
<br />
In some ways, it turned out that that call really was the beginning of a dream.<br />
<br />
I had applied for the Fellowship because I wanted to work with the brightest minds in media research and broaden my understanding of the intersections between journalism and technology. I was thrilled to work with leading experts at Pew Research to collect and analyze data that examined <a href=""http://www.journalism.org/2013/11/14/news-use-across-social-media-platforms/"">how social media is transforming the way Americans consume and share news</a>. I also had a chance to learn from Google’s own <a href=""http://www.google.com/get/mediatools/"">mapping and data visualization specialists</a>. But I never imagined we’d also shadow an editorial meeting at The Miami Herald, discuss the future of news with <a href=""http://www.knightfoundation.org/"">Knight Foundation</a> staff, talk directly with news startup leaders and take part in a design sprint at a <a href=""http://cironline.org/"">CIR</a>/Google conference around data and the news.<br />

<br />
Many of the inaugural class of Google Fellows has gone on to carve out careers in the newsrooms of the 21st century. The Fellowship helped me land a full-time position at the <a href=""http://www.journalism.org/"">Pew Research Center’s Journalism Project</a> as a research associate—a dream job, where I’ll use various research methods—from surveys to content analysis to good ol' reporting—to help examine how news and information functions today. One key project that I’ll work on this year will be a deep examination of the flow of local news in society today.<br />
<br />
Now a new class of Google Fellows gets a chance to fulfill their own dreams. These 11 students are people to watch—young scholars, computer scientists and practitioners who will likely create new journalism products and platforms that will change our engagement with news in the digital age.<br />

As you go about your day reading, writing and checking messages, there are tons of security measures running behind the scenes to keep your email safe, secure, and there whenever you need it.<br />
<br />
Starting today, Gmail will always use an encrypted HTTPS connection when you check or send email. Gmail has <a href=""http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/making-security-easier.html"">supported HTTPS</a> since the day it launched, and in 2010 we made <a href=""http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/default-https-access-for-gmail.html"">HTTPS the default</a>. Today's change means that no one can listen in on your messages as they go back and forth between you and Gmail’s servers—no matter if you're using public WiFi or logging in from your computer, phone or tablet. <br />
<br />
In addition, every single email message you send or receive—100 percent of them—is encrypted while moving internally. This ensures that your messages are safe not only when they move between you and Gmail's servers, but also as they move between Google's data centers—something we made a top priority after last summer’s revelations.<br />
<br />
Of course, being able to access your email is just as important as keeping it safe and secure. In 2013, Gmail was available 99.978 percent of the time, which averages to less than two hours of disruption for a user for the entire year. Our engineering experts look after Google's services 24x7 and if a problem ever arises, they're on the case immediately. We keep you informed by posting updates on the <a href=""http://www.google.com/appsstatus"">Apps Status Dashboard</a> until the issue is fixed, and we always conduct a full analysis on the problem to prevent it from happening again.<br />
<br />
Our commitment to the security and reliability of your email is absolute, and we’re constantly working on ways to improve. You can learn about additional ways to keep yourself safe online, like <a href=""http://www.google.com/safetycenter/everyone/start/password/"">creating strong passwords</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/2step/"">enabling 2-step verification</a>, by visiting the Security Center: <a href=""https://www.google.com/help/security"">https://www.google.com/help/security</a>.<br />

Since announcing Chromecast in the U.S., <a href=""http://chromecast.com/apps"">we’ve grown to include more</a> of your favorite apps and websites. Those numbers will continue to grow, and we want to bring Chromecast to more people around the world. Today Chromecast is available in an additional 11 countries—Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the U.K. <br />
<br />
In addition to your favorite apps like YouTube, Google Play Movies, Google Play Music and Netflix (where available), we’re working with local content providers to bring even more of the movies and TV shows you love to Chromecast. Apps will start rolling out today, and include BBC iPlayer in the U.K.; France TV Pluzz and SFR TV in France with CANALPLAY coming soon; and Watchever in Germany with Maxdome coming soon. So instead of huddling around your laptop to watch Sherlock solve the next crime or getting caught up on all the workplace drama in Stromberg, you can cast it, sit back, and watch together on the big screen.<br />
<br />
Chromecast will keep getting better. We recently opened up <a href=""http://chrome.blogspot.com/2014/02/chromecast-is-now-open-to-developers.html"">Chromecast to developers</a>, and in a few short weeks more than 3,000 developers worldwide have signed up to bring their apps and websites to Chromecast. You’ll soon have more TV shows, movies, videos, sports, music and games to choose from. Stay up-to-date on the latest apps that work with Chromecast at <a href=""http://chromecast.com/apps"">chromecast.com/apps</a>.<br />
<br />
So if you’re in one of these 11 countries, <a href=""http://chromecast.com/"">look for Chromecast</a> starting today at Amazon, Google Play, Currys PC World,  Elkjøp, FNAC, Saturn, Media Markt and other retailers.<br />
<br />
Happy casting!<br />

These powerful supercomputers keep us connected to the world and the people we love. But we're only at the beginning; we’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s possible with mobile technology. That’s why we’re so excited about wearables—they understand the context of the world around you, and you can interact with them simply and efficiently, with just a glance or a spoken word.<br />
<br />
<b>Android Wear: Information that moves with you&nbsp;</b><br />
Today we’re announcing Android Wear, a project that extends Android to wearables. And we’re starting with the most familiar wearable—watches. Going well beyond the mere act of just telling you the time, a range of new devices along with an expansive catalogue of apps will give you:<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Useful information when you need it most.</b> Android Wear shows you info and suggestions you need, right when you need them. The wide variety of Android applications means you’ll receive the latest posts and updates from your favorite social apps, chats from your preferred messaging apps, notifications from shopping, news and photography apps, and more.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Straight answers to spoken questions.</b> Just say “Ok Google” to ask questions, like how many calories are in an avocado, what time your flight leaves, and the score of the game. Or say “Ok Google” to get stuff done, like calling a taxi, sending a text, making a restaurant reservation or setting an alarm.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>The ability to better monitor your health and fitness.</b> Hit your exercise goals with reminders and fitness summaries from Android Wear. Your favorite fitness apps can give you real-time speed, distance and time information on your wrist for your run, cycle or walk.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Your key to a multiscreen world.</b> Android Wear lets you access and control other devices from your wrist.  Just say “Ok Google” to fire up a music playlist on your phone, or cast your favorite movie to your TV. There’s a lot of possibilities here so we’re eager to see what developers build.&nbsp;</li>

<b>Developer Preview&nbsp;</b><br />
If you’re a developer, there’s a new section on <a href=""http://developer.android.com/wear"">developer.android.com/wear</a> focused on wearables. Starting today, you can download a Developer Preview so you can tailor your existing app notifications for watches powered by Android Wear. Because Android for wearables works with Android's rich notification system, many apps will already work well. Look out for more developer resources and APIs coming soon. We’re also already working with several consumer electronics manufacturers, including Asus, HTC, LG, Motorola and Samsung; chip makers Broadcom, Imagination, Intel, Mediatek and Qualcomm; and fashion brands like the Fossil Group to bring you watches powered by Android Wear later this year.<br />

The piece, entitled <i><a href=""http://www.unnumberedsparks.com/"">Unnumbered Sparks</a></i>, is a collaboration between artist&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.echelman.com/"">Janet Echelman</a> and Google Creative Director Aaron Koblin, as part of <a href=""http://www.ted.com/"">TED</a>’s 30th annual conference.  <br />
<br />
Echelman is known for building sculptures that respond to the forces of nature—wind, water and light—and this project is no exception. Made from ultralight fibers, the sculpture soars from the roof of a skyscraper over the water and walkways near the Vancouver Convention Center (<a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/49%C2%B017'17.3%22N+123%C2%B006'52.8%22W/@49.2881389,-123.1146667,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x"">site map</a>).

<br />
What's not obvious to the public is when you look at the sculpture, you're actually looking at a web browser. The interactive lighting is actually one giant Chrome window, stretched across the 300-foot long sculpture with the help of five high-definition projectors. To interact, visitors open a website using <a href=""http://www.google.com/chrome/"">Chrome</a> or other modern mobile browser on their smartphone or tablet. After selecting a color, they use their fingers to trace paths along the surface of their device, which are then projected onto the sculpture in real-time as colorful beams of light. The result is a crowd-controlled visual experiment on a giant, floating canvas.<br />

Art and technology are continuously evolving together, and we hope that this project showcases the opportunity for mobile devices and the web to play a part in that evolution. We all carry devices in our pockets that have the power to connect with people around the world, but rarely do we get a chance to use this incredible power to connect and create with the people standing next to us. With <i>Unnumbered Sparks</i>, we hope to turn strangers into collaborators, working together to create a single piece of art on this amazing canvas.<br />

This decision enabled tens of thousands to start working together to build the web. Now, <a href=""http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/press_releases/2013/41.aspx#.UxmA8_mSydg"">about 40 percent of us</a> are connected and creating online. The web has generated <a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/internet_matters"">trillions of dollars of economic value</a>, transformed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning"">education</a> and <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/6-ways-technology-is-improving-healthcare-2010-12?op=1"">healthcare</a> and activated many new movements for democracy around the world. And we’re just getting started.<br />
<br />
How has this happened? By design, the underlying Internet and the WWW are non-hierarchical, decentralized and radically open. The web can be made to work with any type of information, on any device, with any software, in any language. You can link to any piece of information. You don’t need to ask for permission. What you create is limited only by your imagination.<br />
<br />
So today is a day to celebrate. But it’s also an occasion to think, discuss—and do. Key decisions on the governance and future of the Internet are looming, and it’s vital for all of us to speak up for the web’s future. How can we ensure that the other 60 percent around the world who are not connected get online fast? How can we make sure that the web supports all languages and cultures, not just the dominant ones? How do we build consensus around open standards to link the coming Internet of Things? Will we allow others to package and restrict our online experience, or will we protect the magic of the open web and the power it gives us to say, discover, and create anything? How can we build systems of checks and balances to hold the groups that  can spy on the net accountable to the public? These are some of my questions—what are yours?<br />
<br />
On the 25th birthday of the web, I ask you to join in—to help us imagine and build the future standards for the web, and to press for every country to develop a digital bill of rights to advance a free and open web for everyone. Learn more at <a href=""http://www.webat25.org/"">webat25.org</a> and speak up for the sort of web we really want with #web25. <br />

Tobi was a GSoC student in 2007 for <a href=""http://www.gnome.org/"">GNOME</a>, a free software desktop environment. He’s been a regular contributor to the GNOME community ever since—and in 2012, Tobi was elected to the GNOME Foundation <a href=""https://wiki.gnome.org/FoundationBoard"">board of directors</a>. <br />
<br />
Tobi is one of more than 7,500 students who have participated in Google Summer of Code program over the past nine years. Every summer, GSoC participants work with various organizations in the open source community, building important technical skills and gaining workplace experience. Students aren’t the only ones who benefit; their projects also give back to the open source community. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Sandler"">Karen Sandler</a>, GNOME’s executive director, told us how Google Summer of Code “encourages and empowers” new contributors and helps “invigorate projects.”<br />

Over the next few years and without a college degree or any formal funding, she grew her business to employ more than 30 people and serve thousands of clients. <br />
<br />
Though to me she's one-of-a-kind, it turns out there are other women like my mom out there. According to the National Association of Women Business Owners, women make up 30 percent of U.S. business owners and employ nearly 7.8 million workers. Even though women-owned enterprises operate with far less capital, in the venture-backed tech industry, they produce 12 percent higher returns. That means that not only is supporting women in business the right thing to do, it’s also the smart thing to do. <br />
<br />
In an effort to find new ways to advance female entrepreneurs, this week <a href=""http://www.google.com/entrepreneurs/"">Google for Entrepreneurs</a> is committing $1 million in aggregate to 40 startup-focused organizations, challenging them to increase the representation of women in their respective tech communities. From simply changing the times of events to accommodate busy moms to teaching young girls to see themselves as entrepreneurs, 40 of our partner communities will soon launch new programs and outreach initiatives to encourage women founders. We’re calling this collective effort <a href=""http://www.google.com/entrepreneurs/initiatives/40-forward.html"">#40Forward</a>. Here are a few highlights from our global community:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.1871.com/"">1871</a> in Chicago is launching a new accelerator program for women founded or co-founded companies that’s more flexible and family-friendly, with a customized plan for each startup.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.mercycorps.org/press-room/releases/first-gaza-technology-startups-accepted-gaza-sky-geeks-accelerator"">Gaza Sky Geeks</a> in Gaza is providing rewards for women attending startup events to demonstrate the economic value of them getting involved in tech to their families.</li>

In Inuit poetry, the polar bear is known as <i>Pihoqahiak</i>, the ever-wandering one. Some of the most majestic and elusive creatures in the world, polar bears travel hundreds of miles every year, wandering the tundra and Arctic sea ice in search of food and mates.

<i>The Street View Trekker, mounted on a Tundra Buggy, captures images of Churchill’s polar bears</i></div>

With the help of outfitters <a href=""http://www.frontiersnorth.com/"">Frontiers North</a>, the Google Maps team mounted the Street View Trekker onto a specially designed “<a href=""http://www.frontiersnorth.com/the-tundra-buggy-adventure"">Tundra Buggy</a>,” allowing us to travel across this fragile landscape without interfering with the polar bears or other native species. Through October and November we collected Street View imagery from the shores of Hudson’s Bay as the polar bears waited for the sea ice to freeze over.<br />

<i>One of Churchill, Manitoba’s Polar Bears on Street View </i></div>
<br />
<b>Modern cartography and polar bear conservation </b><br />
There’s more to this effort than images of cuddly bears, though. PBI has been working in this region for more than 20 years, and we’ve witnessed firsthand the profound impact of warmer temperatures and <a href=""http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/climate-change.html"">melting sea ice</a> on the polar bear’s environment. Understanding global warming, and its impact on polar bear populations, requires both global and regional benchmarks. Bringing Street View to Canada's tundra establishes a baseline record of imagery associated with specific geospatial data—information that’s critical if we’re to understand and communicate the impact of climate change on their sensitive ecosystem. As we work to safeguard their habitat, PBI can add Street View imagery to the essential tools we use to assess and respond to the biggest threat facing polar bears today.<br />

Hundreds of mayors from across the U.S.&nbsp;<a href=""http://usmayors.org/resolutions/81st_Conference/resolutions-adopted.pdf"">have stated</a>&nbsp;(PDF) that abundant high-speed Internet access is essential for sparking innovation, driving economic growth and improving education. <a href=""http://www.portlandoregon.gov/revenue/article/394195"">Portland</a>, <a href=""http://www.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/Planning/docs/NashvilleNext/ECD%20background%20reportforonline%20posting.pdf"">Nashville</a>&nbsp;(PDF) and dozens of others have made high-speed broadband a pillar of their economic development plans. And Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio, <a href=""http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/High-speed-Internet-access-a-classroom-necessity-4621487.php"">declared</a> in June that every school should have access to gigabit speeds by 2020. <br />
<br />
We've long believed that the Internet’s next chapter will be built on gigabit speeds, so it’s fantastic to see this momentum. And now that we’ve learned a lot from our Google Fiber projects in <a href=""http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2013/11/one-year-of-fiber-in-kansas-city.html"">Kansas City</a>, <a href=""http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2013/11/just-for-austin-how-youll-be-able-to.html"">Austin</a> and <a href=""http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2014/01/new-year-new-internet-choice-for-provo.html"">Provo</a>, we want to help build more ultra-fast networks. So we’ve invited cities in nine metro areas around the U.S.—<a href=""https://fiber.google.com/newcities/"">34 cities altogether</a>—to work with us to explore what it would take to bring them Google Fiber.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7PjU-KYQDWo/UwToJwZHrAI/AAAAAAAAODw/fu-aao_DTOU/s1600/1200map_updated_green2.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7PjU-KYQDWo/UwToJwZHrAI/AAAAAAAAODw/fu-aao_DTOU/s1600/1200map_updated_green2.png"" height=""358"" width=""640"" /></a></div>
We aim to provide updates by the end of the year about which cities will be getting Google Fiber. Between now and then, we’ll work closely with each city’s leaders on a joint planning process that will not only map out a Google Fiber network in detail, but also assess what unique local challenges we might face. These are such big jobs that advance planning goes a long way toward helping us stick to schedules and minimize disruption for residents.<br />
<br />
We’re going to work on a detailed study of local factors that could affect construction, like topography (e.g., hills, flood zones), housing density and the condition of local infrastructure. Meanwhile, cities will complete a checklist of items that will help them get ready for a project of this scale and speed. For example, they’ll provide us with maps of existing conduit, water, gas and electricity lines so that we can plan where to place fiber. They’ll also help us find ways to access existing infrastructure—like utility poles—so we don’t unnecessarily dig up streets or have to put up a new pole next to an existing one. <br />
<br />
While we do want to bring Fiber to every one of these cities, it might not work out for everyone. But cities who go through this process with us will be more prepared for us or any provider who wants to build a fiber network. In fact, we want to give everyone a boost in their thinking about how to bring fiber to their communities; we plan to share what we learn in these 34 cities, and in the meantime you can check out some tips in <a href=""http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2014/02/how-communities-can-facilitate-fiber.html"">a recent guest post on the Google Fiber blog</a> by industry expert <a href=""http://www.ctcnet.us/contact-us/who-we-are/joanne-hovis-president/"">Joanne Hovis</a>. Stay tuned for updates, and we hope this news inspires more communities across America to take steps to get to a gig.<br />

Sometimes this means bringing <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/google-maps-and-waze-outsmarting.html"">great startups</a> to Google—but other times, it means we go to them. Today, we’re launching <a href=""http://www.googlecapital.com/"">Google Capital</a>, a new growth equity fund backed by Google and led by partners David Lawee, Scott Tierney and Gene Frantz.  <br />
<br />
Like our colleagues at <a href=""http://www.gv.com/"">Google Ventures</a>, our goal is to invest in the most promising companies of tomorrow, with one important difference. While Google Ventures focuses mainly on early-stage investments, we’ll be looking to invest in companies solely as they hit their growth phase. That means finding companies that have already built a solid foundation and are really ready to expand their business in big ways. We’ll look across a range of industries for companies with new technologies and proven track records in their fields. Our investments to date include <a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/"">SurveyMonkey</a>, <a href=""https://www.lendingclub.com/"">Lending Club</a> and <a href=""http://renaissance.com/"">Renaissance Learning</a>—with many more to come. <br />
<br />
But it’s not just a monetary investment for us. The most important—and distinctive—feature of Google Capital is how we work with our portfolio companies. Over the past 15 years, Google has built a strong business, and that’s mostly thanks to the great people who work here. Our portfolio companies have abundant access to the talent, passion and strategic expertise of some of Google’s technology and product leaders. While many investors may contribute money and advice to the companies they support, Google Capital is going beyond that and tapping into our greatest assets: our people.  They help <i>us</i> succeed, and we believe they can help our portfolio companies do the same.<br />
<br />
It’s still very early, and investing is a long road. We’re excited about what we’re doing today—but even more excited to see what happens in the years to come. <br />

But these days, we often connect with each other from far-flung locations, coordinating time zones and dialing into conference calls from our phones. Meetings need to catch up with the way we work—they need to be face-to-face, easier to join, and available from anywhere and any device. Starting today, they can be: Any company can upgrade their meeting rooms with a new Chromebox, built on the Chrome principles of speed, simplicity and security. <br />

Here are a few highlights: <br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Instant meeting room</b>. Chromebox for meetings comes with a blazing-fast Intel Core i7-based Chromebox, a high-definition camera, a combined microphone and speaker unit and a remote control. Set up your entire room in minutes and easily manage all meeting rooms from a web-based management console. All you need is the display in your room, and you’re good to go.</li>
<li><b>Simpler and faster meetings</b>. Walk into the room, click the remote once and you’re instantly in the meeting. No more complex dial-in codes, passcodes or leader PINs. Share your laptop screen wirelessly, no need for any cords and adaptors. Integration with Google Apps makes it easy to invite others and add rooms to video meetings, directly from Google Calendar.</li>
<li><b>Meetings with anyone, anywhere</b>. Up to 15 participants can join the video meeting from other conference rooms, their laptops, tablets or smartphones. Need to meet with a customer who doesn’t use Chromebox for meetings? That’s easy too—all they need is a Gmail account. You can also connect to rooms that have traditional video conferencing systems using a new tool from <a href=""http://blog.vidyo.com/vidyo-news/vidyoh2ogooglehangouts/"">Vidyo</a>, and participants who prefer phones can join your meeting with a conference call number from <a href=""https://www.uberconference.com/hangouts"">UberConference</a>.</li>

Chromebox for meetings is available in the U.S. today starting at $999, which includes the ASUS Chromebox and everything you need to get going. That means for the same price that companies have typically paid for one meeting room, they'll be able to outfit 10 rooms—or more. CDW and SYNNEX will help bring Chromebox for meetings to customers and resellers, and Chromeboxes from HP and Dell will be available for meetings in the coming months. Later this year, we plan to launch in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, New Zealand, Spain and the U.K.<br />
<br />
Companies like Eventbrite, Gilt, oDesk and Woolworths have been testing Chromebox for meetings, and have <a href=""https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/business/solutions/for-meetings.html?utm_source=0214cfmlaunch&amp;utm_medium=blog#customers"">told us</a> that they love the simple setup, the ease of use, and being able to see their colleagues in other offices. More importantly, the low price will enable them to extend these benefits to even more employees, rooms and offices. Find out how <a href=""https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/business/solutions/for-meetings.html?utm_source=0214cfmlaunch&amp;utm_medium=blog"">Chromebox for meetings</a> can help you and your coworkers see eye-to-eye.

He’s not the only one: there has long been a connection between science and art. And it’s true today more than ever, as modern artists use technology for inspiration, inventing ways to give life to code, letting it spill from the screen and onto the canvas. We call this “DevArt,” and this summer, we’re teaming up with the <a href=""http://barbican.org.uk/"">Barbican</a> in London and their <a href=""http://www.barbican.org.uk/artgallery/event-detail.asp?ID=15608"">Digital Revolution exhibition</a> to celebrate DevArt in an interactive gallery.

Ideas big and small, practical and playful, thought-provoking and smile-inducing, have started out as doodles. And we’re ready for more!<br />
<br />
Doodle 4 Google is the chance for young artists to think and dream big. Our theme this year, ""If I could invent one thing to make the world a better place…” is all about curiosity, possibility and imagination. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

Creating the best doodle comes with major perks: this year—for the first time ever—the winner of the competition will become an honorary Google Doodler for a day and animate his or her Doodle for the homepage with the Doodle team. The winning Doodle will then be featured on the Google homepage for a day for millions to see. If that’s not cool enough, the winner will also receive a $30,000 college scholarship and a $50,000 Google for Education technology grant for his or her school.<br />
<br />
If you feel like your young artist may need a little nudge to get their creative juices flowing, we’re partnering with <a href=""http://www.discoveryeducation.com/doodle4google/"">Discovery Education</a> to offer <a href=""http://www.google.com/doodle4google/education.html"">videos and activities</a> for teachers and parents as well as a virtual field trip to Google’s headquarters. We’re also offering interactive “Meet the Doodler” <a href=""https://plus.google.com/b/103266364845729488839/events/cdviromg3kt37ogc42grhu6jlnc"">Connected Classrooms</a> sessions where kids can meet Google Doodlers, learn about their process from idea to a Doodle, and ask questions along the way. <br />
<br />
Mark your calendar to <b>send in your kids’ submissions by March 20</b>. Judging starts with Googlers and a panel of guest judges, including astronaut Ron Garan, author of the Percy Jackson Series Rick Riordan, Google[x] Captain of Moonshoot Astro Teller, directors of The LEGO Movie Chris and Phil, President of RISD school Rosanne Somerson, robotics designer Lee Magpili, and authors Lemony Snicket and Mary Pope Osborne.<br />
<br />
On April 29, we’ll announce the 50 state finalists and open up a public vote to select the national winner. These 50 kids will all get to visit Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. on May 21 for a day full of creative workshops and other fun activities—and the winning (animated!) doodle will be revealed on google.com in June. <br />
<br />
Participating is easier than ever. Teachers and parents can download entry forms on our <a href=""http://www.google.com/doodle4google"">Doodle 4 Google site</a>. Doodles can be uploaded digitally to our site or mailed in. We encourage full classrooms to participate too! There’s no limit to the number of doodles from any one school or family...

We want to inspire young people around the world not just to use technology, but to create it. Unfortunately, many kids don’t have access to either the education or encouragement they need to pursue computer science. So five years ago we created the <a href=""https://www.google.com/edu/programs/google-rise-awards/"">Google RISE (Roots in Science and Engineering) Awards</a>, which provide funding to organizations around the world that engage girls and underrepresented students in extracurricular computer science programs.<br />
<br />
This year, the RISE Awards are providing $1.5 million to 42 organizations in 19 countries that provide students with the resources they need to succeed in the field. For example, <a href=""http://www.generatinggenius.org.uk/"">Generating Genius</a> in the U.K. provides after-school computer science programs and mentoring to prepare high-achieving students from disadvantaged communities for admission into top universities. Another awardee, North Carolina-based <a href=""http://starscomputingcorps.org/"">STARS Computer Corps</a>, helps schools in low-income communities gain access to computing resources for their students to use. Visit <a href=""http://www.google.com/edu/programs/google-rise-awards/index.html#!award-recipients"">our site</a> for a full list of our RISE Award recipients.<br />

This year we’re also expanding the program with the RISE Partnership Awards. These awards aim to encourage collaboration across organizations in pursuit of a shared goal of increasing global participation in computer science. For example, more than 5,000 girls in sub-Saharan Africa will learn computer science as a result of a partnership between the Harlem based program <a href=""http://www.elite-education.org/%20"">ELITE</a> and the <a href=""http://www.waawfoundation.org/"">WAAW Foundation</a> in Nigeria.<br />

That’s why for the past four years we’ve shared and continuously expanded and updated information about government requests for user information in our <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/"">Transparency Report</a>.<br />
<br />
Until now, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) opposed our efforts to publish statistics specifically about Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests. Under FISA, the government may apply for orders from a special FISA Court to require U.S. companies to hand over users’ personal information and the content of their communications. Although FISA was passed by elected representatives and is available for anyone to read, the way the law is used is typically kept secret. Last summer’s revelations about government surveillance remind us of the challenges that secrecy can present to a democracy that relies on public debate.<br />
<br />
Last year we <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/09/petition-for-greater-transparency.html"">filed a lawsuit</a> asking the FISA Court to let us disclose the number of FISA requests we may receive and how many users/accounts they include. We’d previously secured permission to publish information about <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/transparency-report-shedding-more-light.html"">National Security Letters</a>, and FISA requests were the only remaining type of demands excluded from our report.<br />
<br />
Today, for the first time, our report on government requests for user information encompasses all of the requests we receive, subject only to <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/faq/#fisa_delays"">delays imposed by the DoJ</a> regarding how quickly we can include certain requests in our statistics.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-trnSw3iC6eE/Uu_alz42-yI/AAAAAAAAOAY/Yc18_7fJIV4/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-03+at+9.59.12+AM.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-trnSw3iC6eE/Uu_alz42-yI/AAAAAAAAOAY/Yc18_7fJIV4/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-03+at+9.59.12+AM.png"" height=""614"" width=""640"" /></a></div>
Publishing <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/US/"">these numbers</a> is a step in the right direction, and speaks to the <a href=""http://reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/"">principles for reform</a> that we announced with other companies last December. But we still believe more transparency is needed so everyone can better understand how surveillance laws work and decide whether or not they serve the public interest. Specifically, we want to disclose the precise numbers and types of requests we receive, as well as the number of users they affect in a timely way. That’s why we need Congress to go another step further and pass <a href=""https://www.cdt.org/files/pdfs/weneedtoknow-transparency-bills-support-letter.pdf"">legislation</a>&nbsp;(PDF)&nbsp;that will enable us to say more.<br />
<br />
You have the right to know how laws affect the security of your information online. We’ll keep fighting for your ability to exercise that right by pushing for greater transparency around the world. <br />

3212166058835738620,,Google Blogs,2014-01-29T14:00:00-08:00,Lenovo to acquire Motorola Mobility,"We’ve just signed an agreement to sell Motorola to Lenovo for $2.91 billion. As this is an important move for Android users everywhere, I wanted to explain why in detail.  <br />
<br />
We acquired Motorola in 2012 to help <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/supercharging-android-google-to-acquire.html"">supercharge the Android ecosystem</a> by creating a stronger patent portfolio for Google and great smartphones for users. Over the past 19 months, Dennis Woodside and the Motorola team have done a tremendous job reinventing the company.  They’ve focused on building a smaller number of great (and great value) smartphones that consumers love.  Both the Moto G and the Moto X are doing really well, and I’m very excited about the smartphone lineup for 2014.  And on the intellectual property side, Motorola’s patents have helped create a level playing field, which is good news for all Android’s users and partners.<br />
<br />
But the smartphone market is super competitive, and to thrive it helps to be all-in when it comes to making mobile devices.  It’s why we believe that Motorola will be better served by Lenovo—which has a rapidly growing smartphone business and is the largest (and fastest-growing) PC manufacturer in the world. This move will enable Google to devote our energy to driving innovation across the Android ecosystem, for the benefit of smartphone users everywhere. As a side note, this does not signal a larger shift for our other hardware efforts. The dynamics and maturity of the wearable and home markets, for example, are very different from that of the mobile industry. We’re excited by the opportunities to build amazing new products for users within these emerging ecosystems.<br />
<br />
Lenovo has the expertise and track record to scale Motorola into a major player within the Android ecosystem. They have a lot of experience in hardware, and they have global reach. In addition, Lenovo intends to keep Motorola’s distinct brand identity—just as they did when they acquired ThinkPad from IBM in 2005.  Google will retain the vast majority of Motorola’s patents, which we will continue to use to defend the entire Android ecosystem.  <br />
<br />
The deal has yet to be approved in the U.S. or China, and this usually takes time. So until then, it’s business as usual. I’m phenomenally impressed with everything the Motorola team has achieved and confident that with Lenovo as a partner, Motorola will build more and more great products for people everywhere.<br />

3095486580021934630,,Google Blogs,2014-01-24T16:46:00-08:00,Today’s outage for several Google services,"Earlier today, most Google users who use logged-in services like Gmail, Google+, Calendar and Documents found they were unable to access those services for approximately 25 minutes. For about 10 percent of users, the problem persisted for as much as 30 minutes longer.  Whether the effect was brief or lasted the better part of an hour, please accept our apologies—we strive to make all of Google’s services available and fast for you, all the time, and we missed the mark today.<br />
<br />
The issue has been resolved, and we’re now focused on correcting the bug that caused the outage, as well as putting more checks and monitors in place to ensure that this kind of problem doesn’t happen again.  If you’re interested in the technical explanation for what occurred and how it was fixed, read on.<br />
<a name='more'></a><br />
At 10:55 a.m. PST this morning, an internal system that generates configurations—essentially, information that tells other systems how to behave—encountered a software bug and generated an incorrect configuration.  The incorrect configuration was sent to live services over the next 15 minutes, caused users’ requests for their data to be ignored, and those services, in turn, generated errors.  Users began seeing these errors on affected services at 11:02 a.m., and at that time our internal monitoring alerted Google’s Site Reliability Team.  Engineers were still debugging 12 minutes later when the same system, having automatically cleared the original error, generated a new correct configuration at 11:14 a.m. and began sending it; errors subsided rapidly starting at this time.  By 11:30 a.m. the correct configuration was live everywhere and almost all users’ service was restored.<br />
<br />
With services once again working normally, our work is now focused on (a) removing the source of failure that caused today’s outage, and (b) speeding up recovery when a problem does occur.  We'll be taking the following steps in the next few days:<br />
1. Correcting the bug in the configuration generator to prevent recurrence, and auditing all other critical configuration generation systems to ensure they do not contain a similar bug.<br />
2. Adding additional input validation checks for configurations, so that a bad configuration generated in the future will not result in service disruption.<br />
3. Adding additional targeted monitoring to more quickly detect and diagnose the cause of service failure.<br />

6324094676629137197,,Google Blogs,2014-01-16T16:00:00-08:00,Introducing our smart contact lens project,"You’ve probably heard that diabetes is a huge and growing problem—affecting one in every 19 people on the planet. But you may not be familiar with the daily struggle that many people with diabetes face as they try to keep their blood sugar levels under control. Uncontrolled blood sugar puts people at risk for a range of dangerous complications, some short-term and others longer term, including damage to the eyes, kidneys and heart. A friend of ours told us she worries about her mom, who once passed out from low blood sugar and drove her car off the road. <br />
<br />
Many people I’ve talked to say managing their diabetes is like having a part-time job. Glucose levels change frequently with normal activity like exercising or eating or even sweating. Sudden spikes or precipitous drops are dangerous and not uncommon, requiring round-the-clock monitoring. Although some people wear glucose monitors with a glucose sensor embedded under their skin, all people with diabetes must still prick their finger and test drops of blood throughout the day. It’s disruptive, and it’s painful. And, as a result, many people with diabetes check their blood glucose less often than they should.  <br />
<br />
Over the years, many scientists have investigated various body fluids—such as tears—in the hopes of finding an easier way for people to track their glucose levels. But as you can imagine, tears are hard to collect and study. At Google[x], we wondered if miniaturized electronics—think: chips and sensors so small they look like bits of glitter, and an antenna thinner than a human hair—might be a way to crack the mystery of tear glucose and measure it with greater accuracy.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

We’re now testing a smart contact lens that’s built to measure glucose levels in tears using a tiny wireless chip and miniaturized glucose sensor that are embedded between two layers of soft contact lens material. We’re testing prototypes that can generate a reading once per second.  We’re also investigating the potential for this to serve as an early warning for the wearer, so we’re exploring integrating tiny LED lights that could light up to indicate that glucose levels have crossed above or below certain thresholds.  It’s still early days for this technology, but we’ve completed multiple clinical research studies which are helping to refine our prototype. We hope this could someday lead to a new way for people with diabetes to manage their disease.<br />
<br />
We’re in discussions with the FDA, but there’s still a lot more work to do to turn this technology into a system that people can use. We’re not going to do this alone: we plan to look for partners who are experts in bringing products like this to market. These partners will use our technology for a smart contact lens and develop apps that would make the measurements available to the wearer and their doctor. We’ve <a href=""http://investor.google.com/corporate/2004/ipo-founders-letter.html"">always said</a> that we’d seek out projects that seem a bit speculative or strange, and at a time when the <a href=""http://www.idf.org/sites/default/files/Global_WDD_Final.pdf"">International Diabetes Federation</a>&nbsp;(PDF) is declaring that the world is “losing the battle” against diabetes, we thought this project was worth a shot. <br />

4082594142070505872,,Google Blogs,2013-12-19T08:00:00-08:00,Transparency Report: Government removal requests continue to rise,"We <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/greater-transparency-around-government.html"">launched</a> the <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport"">Transparency Report</a> in 2010 to provide hard evidence of how laws and policies affect access to information online. Today, for the eighth time, we’re releasing new numbers showing <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/"">requests from governments to remove content</a> from our services. From January to June 2013, we received 3,846 government requests to remove 24,737 pieces of content—a 68 percent increase over the second half of 2012.<br />
<br />
Over the past four years, one worrying trend has remained consistent: governments continue to ask us to remove political content. Judges have asked us to remove information that’s critical of them, police departments want us to take down videos or blogs that shine a light on their conduct, and local institutions like town councils don’t want people to be able to find information about their decision-making processes. These officials often cite defamation, privacy and even copyright laws in attempts to remove political speech from our services. In this particular reporting period, we received 93 requests to take down government criticism and removed content in response to less than one third of them. Four of the requests were submitted as copyright claims. <br />
<br />
You can read more about these requests in the <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/notes/?by=period"">Notes</a> section of the Transparency Report. In addition, we saw a significant increase in the number of requests we received from two countries in the first half of 2013:<br />
<ul>
<li>There was a sharp increase in requests from <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/TR/"">Turkey</a>. We received 1,673 requests from Turkish authorities to remove content from our platforms, nearly a tenfold increase over the second half of last year. About two-thirds of the total requests—1,126 to be exact—called for the removal of 1,345 pieces of content related to alleged violations of <a href=""http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=244466"">law 5651</a>.</li>
<li>Another place where we saw an increase was&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/RU/"">Russia</a>, where there has been an uptick in requests since a <a href=""http://www.rg.ru/2012/10/29/reestr-dok.html"">blacklist law</a> took effect last fall. We received 257 removal requests during this reporting period, which is more than double the number of requests we received throughout 2012.</li>
</ul>
While the information we present in our Transparency Report is certainly not a comprehensive view of censorship online, it does demonstrate a worrying upward trend in the number of government requests, and underscores the importance of transparency around the processes governing such requests. As we continue to add data, we hope it will become increasingly useful and informative in policy debates and decisions around the world. <br />

We want to find out more about our heroes, explore far-away destinations, or settle a dinner table dispute between friends. And sometimes we just search to find out how many calories are in an avocado. <br />
<br />
In our annual <a href=""http://www.google.com/zeitgeist"">Year-End Zeitgeist</a> (“spirit of the times”), we reflect on the people, places, and moments that captured the world’s attention throughout the year. This year marks our most global Zeitgeist to date—with 1,000+ top 10 lists across categories like Trending People, Most-Searched Events and Top Trending Searches from 72 countries. <br />
<br />
As we get ready to turn the page to 2014, we invite you to take a global journey through the biggest moments from the past 12 months in our <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv-sY_z8MNs"">Year in Review video</a>: <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Lv-sY_z8MNs"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
It’s perhaps unsurprising that the #1 trending search of 2013 was an international symbol of strength and peace: <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/topcharts#vm=trendingchart&amp;cid=zgWW1&amp;geo=&amp;date=2013&amp;cat="">Nelson Mandela</a>. Global search interest in the former President of South Africa was already high this year, and after his passing, people from around the world turned to Google to learn more about Madiba and his legacy.<br />
<br />
Tragedies like the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/topcharts#vm=trendingchart&amp;cid=zgWW1&amp;geo=&amp;date=2013&amp;cat="">Boston Marathon</a>, the 6th trending term globally, and <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/topcharts#vm=trendingchart&amp;cid=zgWW3&amp;geo=&amp;date=2013&amp;cat="">Typhoon Haiyan</a>, #2 on our global events list, also captured the world’s attention. And our human desire to help came through, with [<a href=""http://google.com/trends/topcharts#vm=trendingchart&amp;cid=zg2650&amp;geo=US&amp;date=2013&amp;cat="">donate to the Philippines</a>] ranking highly around the world.<br />
<br />
2013 also had moments that made us move. People uploaded more than 1.7 million video versions of the Harlem Shake to YouTube, propelling it to the <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/topcharts#vm=trendingchart&amp;cid=zgWW1&amp;geo=&amp;date=2013&amp;cat="">#5 spot</a>&nbsp;on our global list; it was also the <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/12/youtube-rewind-what-you-watched-in-2013.html"">second most trending video on YouTube</a>. And unashamedly, we all wanted to learn about twerking, which topped this year’s ""what is…""&nbsp;list of search terms (although I’m still not sure I understand that one!). <br />
<br />
Here’s a full look at our top 10 global trending searches of 2013:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Nelson Mandela</li>
<li>Paul Walker</li>
<li>iPhone 5s</li>
<li>Cory Monteith</li>
<li>Harlem Shake</li>
<li>Boston Marathon</li>
<li>Royal Baby</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy s4</li>

<li>North Korea</li>

You shouldn’t have to think about whether you have a WiFi connection when you want to work. So just like Google Docs and Slides, you can now make edits to Sheets offline.

Turn on the new Sheets by checking the “Try the new Google Sheets” box in <a href=""http://g.co/newsheets"">Google Drive settings</a>. From then on, all new spreadsheets you create will work offline and include these new features. We’ll be adding a small list of <a href=""https://support.google.com/drive/answer/3543688"">missing features</a> in the coming months, so if you rely on any of them, you may want to wait a little longer before opting in.<br />

5734631816746076294,,Google Blogs,2013-12-10T02:45:00-08:00,Feast your eyes on new works added today to the Cultural Institute ,"At the <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/"">Cultural Institute</a> we’ve been taking a break from our holiday shopping to feast our eyes on a different kind of gift—the gift of ingenious art that plays tricks on our eyes.<br />
<br />
Called <i>Trompe l'oeil</i>, which means “fool the eye” in French, these techniques require complete control over every detail of size, color, light and gradation of color so that a two-dimensional work appears to be three-dimensional. You can see several examples amongst the <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collections"">new content being launched by 34 global partners</a> today on the Cultural Institute and across our entire collection of more than <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/browse/?c.projectId=art-project&amp;v.view=room&amp;v.filter=items&amp;projectId=art-project"">57,000 artworks</a>.<br />

<i>Santa's jet-skiing all the way to the North Pole from his tropical vacation</i></div>
<br />
To join in the flurry of preparations for Christmas Eve, visit the Village every day through December 24. You'll have the chance to join the elves as they catapult presents and <a href=""http://www.google.com/santatracker/#/village/racer"">race with reindeer</a>—and you'll be able to send holiday wishes to friends and family from Santa himself. The elves make a little more progress each day, so be sure to stop by the Village to see the latest.<br />

<i>Come back to Santa's Village every day to see the newest games and scenes</i></div>
<br />
Meanwhile, a team of Google engineers are working hard to track Santa’s sleigh with the most advanced maps and holiday technology available. On December 24, grab some cookies and apple cider and settle down in front of your computer, phone or TV to follow the big guy across the globe with our Santa Tracker. See where Santa’s going, the number of presents he’s delivered, and what he’s thinking throughout the evening. <br />
<br />
Keep up the holiday cheer across all of your screens. Once the elves approve, we’ll launch the Google Santa Tracker app for Android in mid-December. Use your phone for on-the-go flight practice with the elves or cozy up near the fireplace with your tablet to follow Santa around the world as he delivers presents Christmas Eve. If you have Chromecast, cast from the Santa Tracker Android app to explore the Village or track his route right from your TV. Or, worried you’ll forget the big day? Download the <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/santatracker/"">Chrome extension</a> to count down to Santa’s takeoff while browsing the web for holiday gifts.<br />

So last week we partnered with Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer to run a special session of <a href=""https://www.solveforx.com/"">Solve for X</a> on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., to discuss and debate audacious science and <a href=""https://www.solveforx.com/about/whatisamoonshot/"">technology moonshots</a> that could transform the world.<br />

<br />
Solve for X is a community of individuals and organizations that work together to accelerate progress on moonshots—and what better group of people to work with than those already thinking about our country’s future? As Susan Molinari, our VP of public policy and government affairs, said at the event: ""Policymakers are trying to solve big, intractable problems—and so are engineers. Engineers are tackling challenges that have no answers to date, and so are our policymakers.”<br />
<br />
The D.C. event brought together a group of exceptional technologists, entrepreneurs, polymaths-at-large, <a href=""http://fellowships.aaas.org/"">AAAS fellows</a>, Members of Congress and their staff. Pioneers in their respective fields proposed moonshots in manufacturing, STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education, and access to natural resources:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Neil Gershenfeld and Nadya Peek from the <a href=""http://cba.mit.edu/"">MIT Center for Bits and Atoms</a> proposed setting up FabLabs to bring manufacturing back to America—and in a way appropriate to the 21st century</li>
<li>Theresa Condor from <a href=""http://www.nanosatisfi.com/"">NanoSatisfi</a> proposed an inexpensive way to give all students direct access to personal satellites to conduct their own science experiments and to transform adoption of STEM</li>
<li>Chris Lewicki from <a href=""http://www.planetaryresources.com/"">Planetary Resources</a> proposed mining asteroids for natural resources</li>

<br />
Following the moonshot proposals, we broke into small groups to brainstorm resources, technology and people that could help make the ideas better and happen faster. At Solve for X, brainstorming means two-thirds ""yes and""—creating stepping stones to build on an idea—and one-third ""yes but—providing critical feedback on blind spots or suggesting alternate implementations. <br />

<br />
<br />
Inspired by the upcoming motion picture ""<a href=""http://thehobbit.com/"">The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug</a>,” “Journey through Middle-earth” brings the locations and characters from the movie trilogy to life with a mix of modern web technologies. It was developed by North Kingdom in collaboration with Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures.

Your adventure <a href=""http://thehobbit.com/middle-earth"">starts</a> on a beautiful, interactive map of Middle-earth. Zoom in to explore Trollshaw Forest, Rivendell and Dol Guldur (with more locations to come in the next few weeks). Click on each one to learn its history and meet the characters who inhabit it, or dive further to test your wits on a unique survival challenge.

<br />
<br />
The immersive 3D graphics in “Journey through Middle-earth” were built with CSS3 and WebGL, which you might recognize from <a href=""http://www.chromeexperiments.com/tag/webgl/"">previous Chrome Experiments</a>. But “Journey through Middle-earth” is the first Chrome Experiment designed to bring this beautiful, 3D experience to mobile, thanks to <a href=""http://blog.chromium.org/2013/08/chrome-30-beta-richer-web-on-android.html"">support for WebGL in Chrome for Android</a> on devices with high-end graphics cards. 

<br />
<br />
The rich audio effects and sound manipulation are delivered through the Web Audio API, which is <a href=""http://blog.chromium.org/2013/07/chrome-29-beta-web-audio-and-webrtc-in.html"">now supported</a> on both Chrome for Android and Chrome for iPhone and iPad. Although WebGL isn’t supported on iOS, Chrome users can still experience most of “Journey through Middle-earth” on their iPhones and iPads. We can’t wait to see what sort of rich experiences developers will build as modern web technologies become available on more types of devices. 

<br />

While a teacher eventually helped me understand that California wasn’t in the Confederacy, the moment led me to understand the weight of history and that it has shaped the world into what it is today.<br />
<br />
Today, on the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address, we’re helping make the past come a little bit more alive. <a href=""http://goo.gl/XJQIKi"">Three new exhibits</a> now available on the Google Cultural Institute focus on President Lincoln and the 272 words that shaped a nation’s understanding of its identity.

Nope—we’re still as into it as ever, which is why we’re so pleased to announce our 14th investment: We’re partnering with global investment firm KKR to invest in six utility-scale solar facilities in California and Arizona.  Developed by leading solar developer Recurrent Energy, the projects have a combined capacity of 106MW and will generate enough electricity to power over 17,000 U.S. homes.

Since we began sharing these figures with you <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/greater-transparency-around-government.html"">in 2010</a>, requests from governments for user information have increased by more than 100 percent. This comes as usage of our services continues to grow, but also as more governments have made requests than ever before. And these numbers only include the requests we’re allowed to publish.<br />
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O_rKdFkXfFI/UoQiOdDaZCI/AAAAAAAANvc/pM3ntaTnLjM/s1600/google_transparencyreport_infographic_js4b.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""512"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O_rKdFkXfFI/UoQiOdDaZCI/AAAAAAAANvc/pM3ntaTnLjM/s640/google_transparencyreport_infographic_js4b.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div>
Over the past three years, we’ve continued to add more details to the report, and we’re doing so again today. We’re including additional information about legal process for U.S. criminal requests: breaking out emergency disclosures, wiretap orders, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_register"">pen register</a> orders and other court orders.<br />
<br />
We want to go even further. We believe it’s your right to know what kinds of requests and how many each government is making of us and other companies. However, the U.S. Department of Justice contends that U.S. law does not allow us to share information about some national security requests that we might receive. Specifically, the U.S. government argues that we cannot share information about the requests we receive (if any) under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But you deserve to know.  <br />
<br />
Earlier this year, we brought a federal case to assert that we do indeed have the right to shine more light on the FISA process. In addition, we recently wrote <a href=""https://www.cdt.org/files/pdfs/weneedtoknow-transparency-bills-support-letter.pdf"">a letter of support</a>&nbsp;(PDF) for two pieces of legislation currently proposed in the U.S. Congress. And we’re asking governments around the world to uphold international legal agreements that respect the laws of different countries and guarantee standards for due process are met. <br />
<br />
Our promise to you is to continue to make this report robust, to defend your information from overly broad government requests, and to push for greater transparency around the world. <br />

It was impossible for us to collect images of Venice with a Street View car or trike—blame the picturesque canals and narrow cobbled walkways—but our team of backpackers took to the streets to give Google Maps a truly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice"">Shakespearean</a> backdrop. And not just the streets—we also loaded the Trekker onto a boat and floated by the famous gondolas to give you the best experience of Venice short of being there.<br />

But college can be a tough place for veterans, especially when they’re juggling classes with personal, family and financial pressures. Unfortunately there’s very little data about what can help veterans thrive in school. We want to change that.<br />
<br />
Today, we’re granting a $3.2 million <a href=""http://www.google.com/giving/impact-awards.html"">Global Impact Award</a> to the <a href=""http://vets.syr.edu/"">Institute for Veterans and Military Families</a>, <a href=""http://www.studentveterans.org/"">Student Veterans of America</a>, the <a href=""http://www.possefoundation.org/"">Posse Foundation</a> and <a href=""http://www.vfw.org/"">Veterans of Foreign Wars</a> to support data analysis of U.S. veterans’ higher education. The study will be made public and answer critical questions:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Which colleges are most successful at supporting veterans through to graduation day?</li>
<li>What on-campus programs have the biggest impact?</li>
<li>How do veterans’ education majors stack up against employment opportunities?</li>
</ul>
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Iu4QSTqM8wY"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
Based on the report, we’ll fund the expansion of the veterans’ programs found to be most effective—whether it’s on-campus child care, access to dedicated mental health services or physical gathering spaces—and will also provide Googler support to make this project a reality.<br />
<br />
This award builds on our work to train and mentor student veterans through the <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/11/growing-our-support-for-veterans-and.html"">Google Veterans Network</a>. We’re proud to serve those who’ve served.<br />

These interactions have led to a greater understanding of the challenges the veteran community faces and have inspired many teams across Google to find additional ways for our technology to help.  <br />
<br />
This Veterans Day, on behalf of the Google Veterans Network and all Googlers, we’re proud to share some of the new ways we’re working with partners to support the military veteran community.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://helpouts.google.com/"">Helpouts by Google</a> allows anyone to give and receive help over live video, and we think it can be an effective platform for nonprofit and veteran service organizations to connect with veterans and their families.

Because Helpouts is <a href=""http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/"">HIPAA</a>-compliant, providers such as <a href=""http://www.giveanhour.org/"">Give an Hour</a> can provide secure and confidential <a href=""https://helpouts.google.com/search?q=give%20an%20hour%20veterans"">mental health care sessions</a> online—particularly useful for those veterans who are physically unable to travel from their homes.</li>
<li><a href=""http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2013/11/tour-builder-tell-your-stories-with.html"">Tour Builder</a> is a storytelling tool in beta that enables anyone to record memories of their travels in Google Earth. Tour Builder was inspired by the accomplishments of military service members around the globe. We hope it will give veterans an easy way to share their journeys with loved ones at home and to preserve the legacy of their service for generations to come.</li>
<li>13.5 percent of the nation's businesses are run by veterans, employing a collective 8.2 million people. In recognition of the contributions veterans make to the economy, the Google Enterprise <a href=""http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/"">blog</a> and <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+googleenterprise/posts"">Google+ page</a> will share stories throughout the week from veteran-owned business and service organizations that achieved success with the help of Google Apps—like <a href=""http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2013/11/ruckpack-turns-idea-on-deployment-into.html"">RuckPack Combat Nutrition</a>:  </li>

4500948326925097688,,Google Blogs,2013-11-04T21:00:00-08:00,Introducing Helpouts: Help when you need it over live video,"What if getting help for a computer glitch, a leaky pipe, or a homework problem was as easy as clicking a button? What if you could connect via real-time video to a music teacher or a yoga instructor from the comfort of your home?  What if you could get someone knowledgeable to get you “unstuck” when you really need it?<br />
<br />
Today, we’re announcing <a href=""https://helpouts.google.com/"">Helpouts</a>—a new way to get and give help over live video. Our goal is simple: help people help each other. We want to use the convenience and efficiency of the web to enable everyone, no matter where they are or what time it is, to easily connect with someone who can help.<br />
<br />
Help might be a quick answer to a problem you’re having right now, like how to fix your garage door, or how to remove a computer virus; or it might be guidance completing a project, like building a deck. It might be learning a new skill, like how to speak conversational French or how to draw cartoons; or it might be general advice on how to improve your fitness or your writing (I could use this right now).<br />
<br />
With Helpouts, you can choose who you get help from based on their qualifications, their availability, their price, their ratings and reviews. You can connect instantly or book in advance. You can get help from individuals or from brands you already know and trust, like <a href=""https://helpouts.google.com/101139054682230153939"">Sephora</a>, <a href=""https://helpouts.google.com/108135037100946836685"">One Medical</a>, <a href=""https://helpouts.google.com/103934178127017229125"">Weight Watchers</a>, <a href=""https://helpouts.google.com/102191286201532180154"">Redbeacon</a> (a Home Depot company), and <a href=""https://helpouts.google.com/110544277164840928665"">Rosetta Stone</a>.  Once you’re in a Helpout, you can do more than just talk—you can share your computer screen, collaboratively edit a presentation, or record your Helpout.  And if the experience doesn’t meet your expectations, we offer a full money back guarantee.<br />
<br />
Today is just the beginning. We’re starting small and in a few categories. The number of people giving help on Helpouts and the type of help available will grow over time. Helpouts may not be suitable for every occasion, and it will take time to get used to interactions via real time video.  We hope that the efficiency, convenience and global reach of Helpouts will make people’s lives easier in the long term.  <br />
<br />
We hope you’ll give Helpouts a try and give us your feedback through ratings and reviews, or talk to us on <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+helpouts/"">Google+</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/helpouts"">Twitter</a> or <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Helpouts/161804014010027"">Facebook</a>. And if you’re interested in giving help on Helpouts yourself, <a href=""https://helpouts.google.com/pwelcome?authuser=0"">let us know</a>.<br />

First, we're excited to unwrap our latest platform release, KitKat, which delivers a smarter, more immersive Android experience to even more people. And second, we're introducing Nexus 5—a new Nexus phone developed with LG.<br />
<br />
The first thing you’ll notice about KitKat is we’ve made the experience much more engaging: the book you're reading, the game you're playing, or the movie you're watching—now all of these take center stage with the new immersive mode, which automatically hides everything except what you really want to see. <br />
<br />
<b>Bringing more Google smarts to Android </b><br />
Behind the polish on the screen is the power under the hood. Take the Phone app, which for most people hasn’t really changed since the days of flip phones. Now, we’re making calling easier than ever, by helping you search across your contacts, nearby places, or even Google Apps accounts (like your company’s directory), directly from within the app. And with the <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/10/google-hangouts-and-photos-save-some.html"">new Hangouts app</a>, all of your SMS and MMS messages are together in the same place, alongside your other conversations and video calls, so you’ll never miss a message no matter how your friends send it. This is just a small taste of KitKat—learn more on our <a href=""http://www.android.com/versions/kit-kat-4-4/"">site</a>.<br />
<br />
Google has always focused on helping users get immediate access to the information they need, and we want to bring this same convenience and power to users on Android. With the new Nexus 5 launcher, Google smarts are deeply integrated into the phone you carry around with you, so getting to the information you need is simple, easy and fast. Swipe once from the home screen to get Google Now literally at your fingertips. Put Google to work for you by saying “OK, Google” to launch voice search, send a text, get directions or even play a song you want to hear. And in the coming weeks, we’re enhancing Now with important new card types that bring you information about contextual topics that interest you such as updates from a favorite website or blog.<br />
<br />
<b>Reaching the next 1 billion users</b><br />
Building a platform that makes mobile phones accessible for everyone has always been at the heart of Android. Until now, some lower-end Android phones couldn't benefit from more recent Android releases due to memory constraints. With KitKat, we've slimmed down Android’s memory footprint by doing things like removing unnecessary background services and reducing the memory consumption of features that you use all the time. We did this not only within Android but across Google services like Chrome and YouTube. RAM (or memory) is one of the most expensive parts of a phone, and now Android can run comfortably on the 512MB of RAM devices that are popular in much of the world, bringing the latest goodies in Android 4.4 within reach for the next billion smartphone users.<br />
<br />
<b>Introducing Nexus 5</b><br />
Along with our <a href=""http://www.android.com/kitkat/"">sweet naming tradition</a>, we also introduce a new device with each platform release to showcase the latest Android innovations. For KitKat, we partnered with LG to develop Nexus 5 -- the slimmest and fastest Nexus phone ever made. Its design is simple and refined to showcase the 5” Full HD display. Nexus 5 also keeps you connected at blazing speeds with 4G/LTE and ultra fast wifi. The advanced new lens on Nexus 5 captures more light for brighter night and sharper action shots. And with optical image stabilization, you no longer have to worry about shaky hands and blurry pictures. A new HDR+ mode automatically snaps a rapid burst of photos and combines them to give you the best possible single shot. Learn more on our <a href=""http://www.google.com/nexus/5"">site</a>.<br />
<div style=""text-align: center;""><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/hQ0XTJqFLIE"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">Nexus 5 is available today, unlocked and without a contract, on <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/devices"">Google Play</a> in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan and Korea (and coming soon to India), starting at $349. Just in the time for the holidays, Nexus 5 will be available soon at the following retailers: Sprint, T-Mobile, Amazon, Best Buy and RadioShack.</div><br />
Android 4.4, KitKat, which comes on Nexus 5, will also soon be available on Nexus 4, 7, 10, the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One Google Play edition devices in the coming weeks.<br />
<br />
How’s that for a treat?<br />

So today's improvements to Google+ Hangouts and Photos aim to take a lot of the work out of messaging, video calling and photo editing.<br />
<br />
<b>Hangouts</b><br />
<br />
Hangouts enable conversations among close friends, as well as broadcasts with the entire world. Today we're improving both:<br />
<ul><li>Hangouts for Android now supports <b>location sharing and SMS</b>. This way you can send a map of your current location (vs. finding and typing an address), and you can send and receive SMS (vs. switching between apps). <b>Animated GIFs</b> also play inline.</li>
<li>Broadcasters can now <b>schedule Hangouts On Air</b>, then promote them with a <b>dedicated watch page</b>. Once you're live, <b>Control Room</b> lets you moderate the conversation with eject and remote mute.</li>
<li>In both cases, the video calling experience is significantly improved. It's now <b>full screen</b> across mobile and desktop, and it <b>fixes and enhances webcam lighting</b> automatically.</li>
</ul><br />

The Android app and video calling features will be available in a few days, while the On Air improvements will roll out over the next few weeks.<br />
<br />
<b>Photos and videos</b><br />
<br />
Photos and videos capture life's most precious moments, but it’s way too hard to save, organize, edit and share your stuff. Google+ can make things easier, automatically.<br />
<ul><li>For starters, <b>full size backups and background sync</b> are coming soon to Google+ for iOS. This way you can backup your photos as you take them.</li>
<li>In addition, <b>finding your photos is actually fun</b>. We now recognize over a thousand different objects—from sunsets to snowmen—so you can just type what you’re looking for, and find matching items in your library.</li>
<li>Auto Enhance improves each photo you add to Google+, and now you can now <b>dial the enhancements up or down</b>. If you’re already processing your images elsewhere, you can choose to <b>exempt an album entirely</b>.</li>
<li>If you like to edit on the go, then you’ll enjoy Snapseed and its new <b>HDR Scape</b> filter. While high dynamic range (HDR) imaging requires multiple photos to create its effect, HDR Scape can deliver similar results with a single tap.</li>
<li>We’re also adding <b>Analog Efex Pro</b> to the Nik Collection (still just $149). With it you can reimagine your images using classic cameras and processing methods—from toy and medium format to wet plate and vintage.</li>
</ul><br />

</div>Auto Awesome can help bring your story to life in creative ways. Today we’re adding three new techniques:<br />
<ul><li><b>Action.</b> Maybe it’s your child’s first gymnastic meet, or you’re skateboarding with a friend. Action can take their tumble or half pipe trick, and create a strobe-effect photograph.</li>
<li><b>Eraser. </b>When you’re taking pictures of landmarks, people and cars often get in the way. Eraser can take a sequence of these photos, and erase whatever’s moving to give you a “cleaner” image.</li>
<li><b>Movie.</b> Movie produces highlight reels from your photos and videos—complete with effects, transitions and a soundtrack—automatically. You can share the movie as is, or dive into the editing process to customize even further.</li>

<br />
All of today’s photo and video improvements will be available this week. Auto Awesome Movie works on certain devices with Android 4.3+, but all the other app features are widely supported.<br />
<br />
With 540 million people active across Google each month, 300 million people active in just the stream and more than 1.5 billion photos uploaded every week, the Google+ community is growing faster than we ever could have imagined. Today’s updates are our way of saying “thank you”—we hope they save you time, and help you share your story.<br />

Today <a href=""http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2013,1054.html"">one out of every three</a> people lives in a society that is severely censored. Online barriers can include everything from filters that block content to targeted attacks designed to take down websites.  For many people, these obstacles are more than an inconvenience—they represent full-scale repression. <br />
<br />
This week, in partnership with the <a href=""http://www.cfr.org/"">Council on Foreign Relations</a> and the <a href=""http://www.gennextfoundation.org/"">Gen Next Foundation</a>, Google Ideas—our “think/do tank”—is hosting a summit in New York entitled “Conflict in a Connected World.”<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""420"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/9kUDUxS6ZYw"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
The summit brings together “hacktivists,” security experts, entrepreneurs, dissidents and others to explore the changing nature of conflict and how online tools and can both harm and protect. We’re also assessing what might be done to better protect people confronting online censorship. With our partners, we will launch several new products and initiatives designed to help:<br />
<ul>
<li><b><a href=""http://g.co/projectshield"">Project Shield</a></b> is an initiative that enables people to use Google’s technology to better protect websites that might otherwise have been taken offline by “distributed denial of service” (DDoS) attacks. We’re currently inviting webmasters serving independent news, human rights, and elections-related content to apply to <a href=""http://g.co/projectshield"">join</a> our next round of trusted testers.<br />
</li>
<li>The <b><a href=""http://www.digitalattackmap.com/"">Digital Attack Map</a></b> is a live data visualization, built through a collaboration between Arbor Networks and Google Ideas, that maps DDoS attacks designed to take down websites—and their content—around the globe.

Here is his story.</i> -Ed. <br />
<br />
Andrew (“Andy” to his friends) has been a passionate skateboarder for as long as he can remember. To make his dream of building a skatepark for his community come true, in 2012 Andy entered a competition to lease a piece of land in Hackney Wick, in East London. He won—then realized he had no budget to build his dream.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NRaQop0NP5Y/UmDUl6yK_OI/AAAAAAAANWY/Imfs5oOsbYM/s1600/_S6A2639_small.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""425"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NRaQop0NP5Y/UmDUl6yK_OI/AAAAAAAANWY/Imfs5oOsbYM/s640/_S6A2639_small.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></div>Using Search and Maps, Andrew found a wealth of reclaimed materials in the area. From screws to planks of wood to sheets of ply, he sourced his skatepark materials from local suppliers and businesses. An engineering graduate, he also used YouTube to learn how to use new materials, like marble. The result: an empty building site turned into a thriving community skatepark—Frontside Gardens.<br />

</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">For Hackney Wick families and kids, Frontside Gardens is more than a skatepark. Built by hand from scratch, it’s a place to enjoy a sunny day, learn new skills and make the most of what they've got together.

He woke up hours later, alone and in an unfamiliar place. This fateful train ride ripped Saroo away from his home and family. For more than a quarter century, he searched for them before finding his way back home with the help of <a href=""http://earth.google.com/"">Google Earth</a>. <br />
<br />
This incredible true story spans decades, miles and continents. If it weren’t for hope, determination and technology, Saroo would have remained forever lost.<br />
<div style=""text-align: center;""><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/UXEvZ8B04bE"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">On that day 27 years ago, Saroo and his 14-year-old brother, Guddu, were searching a train station for change to help support their family. Guddu wandered beyond the station and Saroo fell asleep on a stationary train waiting for his brother’s return. When he woke up, the train had left the station, separating Saroo from his home and family.</div><br />
The train Saroo boarded was in <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=Berhampur%2C+Odisha%2C+India&amp;data=!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x3a3d500ef1cb60ad%3A0x5b75778874294ff!3m8!1m3!1d28433!2d76.3512036!3d21.8350454!3m2!1i1280!2i737!4f13.1!4m2!3d19.3149618!4d84.7940911"">Berhanpur, India</a>, and he ended up 1,500 kilometers away, in Calcutta. For weeks, he survived on the streets. Eventually, he was taken into an orphanage, where he was adopted by the Brierleys, an Australian family. He moved across an ocean to the town of <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=hobart+australia&amp;data=!4m12!2m11!1m10!1s0xaa6e7584e52ccfed%3A0x503c94dd0de1530!3m8!1m3!1d97762!2d-105.2399774!3d40.0293099!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1"">Hobart</a> in Tasmania. At six years old, Saroo had a new family, home, country and name. Though Saroo Munshi Khan couldn’t find his home, Saroo Brierley never gave up the search. <br />
<br />
In 2011, using vague memories and Google Earth imagery, Saroo identified his home town. Using the ruler feature in Google Earth, he mapped out a search radius by making an educated guess about how far he traveled by train. After countless hours of scouring this area of Google Earth imagery, he came upon a proverbial needle in a haystack. Saroo spotted one vague landmark that led him to the next, helping him unlock a five-year-old child’s memories. He eventually spotted a neighborhood, street and tin roof that looked familiar. <br />
<br />
In Saroo's words, ""It was just like being Superman. You are able to go over and take a photo mentally and ask, 'Does this match?' And when you say, 'No,' you keep on going and going and going.""<br />
<br />
In 2012, Saroo embarked on a trip from Australia back to Khandwa, India. Once he arrived, he shared his story with locals, who helped him find his way back home to his mother and surviving brother and sister. Twenty-six years after accidentally leaving home, he finally found his way back.<br />

189808869989982878,,Google Blogs,2013-10-08T06:01:00-07:00,"The new HP Chromebook, made with Google","We need our computers to be as fast and mobile as we are. We want to work across multiple screens—often at the same time. We want the latest and greatest software and we want to be able to get to our stuff from wherever we are. Chromebooks offer all of that, making computers that are simpler, more secure and more affordable, for everyone.   <br />
<br />
Earlier today, <a href=""http://h20435.www2.hp.com/t5/The-Next-Bench-Blog/HP-Chromebook11-Made-with-Google/ba-p/83539"">HP introduced</a> the <a href=""http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/hp-chromebook-11/"">HP Chromebook 11</a>. Designed and built in partnership with our friends at HP, it has all of the speed, simplicity and security benefits you'd expect from a Chromebook, and some unique design elements that address many of the challenges people face with computers today.   <br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X7QisoutXqw/UlP6Ay1KqrI/AAAAAAAAAEk/JegQruRExZ8/s1600/8_HP_Chromebook_11_Color_Stack.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""213"" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X7QisoutXqw/UlP6Ay1KqrI/AAAAAAAAAEk/JegQruRExZ8/s320/8_HP_Chromebook_11_Color_Stack.jpg"" width=""320"" /></a></div><br />
First, a laptop should be light and mobile. So the new Chromebook is really thin with no extra fluff. It weighs in at just over two pounds—one of the lightest laptops on the market. There are also no sharp edges so nothing digs into your wrists while you type. And when you’re traveling, you don’t need to throw an extra charger into your bag. The HP Chromebook 11 is powered by a micro-USB charger, which can also be used to juice up your Android phone or tablet.   <br />
<br />
Second, a computer should look good—something you’re proud to take out at a coffee shop. So the new Chromebook has a sleek, distinctive and super simple look. The fanless design means it doesn’t need any grills for venting. And it comes in a variety of colors to match your mood (or your wardrobe).   <br />
<br />
And there are a bunch of other things that we hope will make your computing experience even more awesome: <br />
<ul><li><b>Brilliant display</b>. Often when folks gather around a screen, everyone tries to gently nudge the computer in their own direction so they can see better. No more nudging. The new Chromebook's screen has a 176-degree viewing angles so you can see even when looking at it almost completely sideways. And the super bright display brings all of your favorite photos, shows and videos to life. </li>
<li><b>Light but sturdy</b>. We wanted the Chromebook to hold up well against everyday bumps and bruises. So it has a magnesium frame that makes it incredibly sturdy. You can hold it from a single corner without it bending or flexing. </li>
<li><b>Finely-tuned speakers</b>. Many computers have speakers on the bottom, which is great if you have ears in your lap. Instead, the speakers on the new Chromebook are under the keyboard, which means the sound is crisp, clear and pointed up towards your ears.</li>
<li><b>Goodies built-in</b>. And, of course, many Google apps come built-in, including 100GB of Google Drive cloud storage (free for two years) and a 60-day free trial of Google Play Music All Access.</li>
</ul><br />
This Chromebook is crafted with the same obsessive attention to detail as the Chromebook Pixel. But we worked hard with HP to keep the price low: the new HP Chromebook 11 is available for just $279.   <br />
<br />
Look for it starting today at Best Buy, Amazon, Google Play and HP Shopping in the U.S., as well as at Currys, PC World and many other retailers in the U.K. It will be available in other countries that sell Chromebooks in time for the holidays.   <br />

So if you’ve been looking for a computer that makes it easier to get stuff done (and look good doing it), we hope you give the new HP Chromebook 11 a try—or add it to your <a href=""http://g.co/giveachromebook"">gift list</a> this holiday season. We designed it to make computing faster, simpler and more secure, for everyone.   <br />

337306699708506341,,European Public Policy Blog,2013-10-08T02:14:00-07:00,The cultural catwalk: 5000+ new works in the Cultural Institute,"The past few weeks, Fashion Week in New York, London, Paris and Milan have given us a feast for the eyes with parades of creativity, color and design. At the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/home"">Cultural Institute</a>&nbsp;(follow us on G+&nbsp;<a href=""https://plus.google.com/+googleculturalinstitute/posts"">here</a>), we're putting on a fashion show of a different kind with new content from 36 partners. Many of these cultural treasures, from China, Hungary, Mexico and 16 other countries, have a strong link to fashion and design through the ages.<br />
<br />
Fabrics are the starting point of many designs. You can see this in the wonderful costumes added by the Textile Museum of Canada to the Google Art Project. Highlights include a <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/kimono/-AEABaL4y-g1ZA?projectId=art-project"">kimono</a> from Japan, a <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/cape/MAFUKdPoDPzyJQ?projectId=art-project"">cape</a> from Polynesia and an 1800s <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/jacket/pwHRdw51QxszrA?projectId=art-project"">jacket</a> with beautiful detail from Greece. The creation of these fabrics is highly skilled work; in an online <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/wQGDHiAc"">exhibition</a>, The Craft Revival Trust gives us an insight into the 5,000-year-old Indian textile tradition which creates the prints, motifs and colors that are still used today, while the <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/colonial-williamsburg-foundation?projectId=art-project"">The Art Museums of Colonial Williamsburg</a> exhibits quilts of delicate beauty.   <br />

6564604319334791566,,Google Blogs,2013-10-01T01:00:00-07:00,An Austrian star of European computing,"Google started as a <a href=""http://www.google.com/about/company/timeline/"">graduate school project</a>. So it’s apt that the next film in our <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG7EqWtzeIhUJFbSVfdGXw7fUvAfr0tb_"">computing heritage series</a> pays homage to the work of another student team, nearly 60 years ago in Austria.  <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/lvaiEW-Sm4A?list=PLG7EqWtzeIhUJFbSVfdGXw7fUvAfr0tb_"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
In the mid 1950’s, computer design was in the midst of a major transition, going from <a href=""http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/upgrade-repair-pc,3000-2.html"">vacuum tubes</a> to <a href=""http://www.computerhistory.org/semiconductor/timeline/1953-transistorized-computers-emerge.html"">transistors</a>. Transistors <a href=""http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/physics/transistor/history/"">performed a similar function electronically</a>, but generated less heat and were a fraction of the size, allowing machines to be made that were both smaller and more powerful.  <br />
<br />
<a href=""http://www.zemanek.at/"">Heinz</a> <a href=""http://purl.umn.edu/107723"">Zemanek</a>, then an assistant professor at the <a href=""http://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/"">Vienna University of Technology</a>, had long been interested in computers. In 1956, he enlisted a team of students to build one based on this new transistor technology.  <br />
<br />
Zemanek’s project didn’t have university backing, so the team relied on donations. One student’s work was sponsored by <a href=""http://www.zib.de/zuse/home.php/Main/KonradZuse"">Konrad Zuse</a>, the German computer pioneer, on the understanding he would join Zuse’s company after completing his doctorate. Additional money came from an Austrian bankers association, thanks to connections Zemanek had made through his role leading <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_and_Girl_Guides_of_Austria"">Austria’s Boy Scouts</a>. Overall more than 35 companies contributed materials, in particular <a href=""http://www.philips.com/about/company/history/index.page"">Philips</a>, who donated all the transistors and diodes.  The only drawback was the transistors were relatively slow, originally designed for hearing aids.<br />
<br />
At the time, leading U.S. machines were named after types of wind, such as MIT’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlwind_I"">Whirlwind</a> and RCA Laboratory’s <a href=""http://blog.modernmechanix.com/navy-brain-answers-with-pictures/"">Typhoon</a>. In a gentle nod to this, Zemanek nicknamed his computer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail%C3%BCfterl"">Mailüfterl</a>, meaning “May Breeze.”  <a href=""http://invention.smithsonian.org/downloads/fa_cohc_tr_zema721212.pdf"">As he joked</a>&nbsp;(PDF): ""We are not going to produce… any of those big American storms, but we will have a very nice little Viennese spring breeze!” <br />
<br />
On May 27, 1958 the Mailüfterl ran its first calculation and became mainland Europe’s first fully transistorized computer—and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transistorized_computers"">one of the earliest in the world</a>.  It remained at the university for its first few years, financed in part by the European Research Office of the American Army.  In 1960 Zemanek signed a contract with IBM, and in September 1961 the Mailüfterl was moved to a new research laboratory in Vienna that IBM created for Zemanek and his team.  <br />
<br />
Today the Mailüfterl is on display at the <a href=""http://www.technischesmuseum.at/language/en-us/home"">Technical Museum in Vienna</a>—a fitting reminder of Austria’s time at the vanguard of European computing. <br />

2244472770339663063,,Google Blogs,2013-09-23T07:27:00-07:00,Explore the world’s constitutions with a new online tool ,"Constitutions are as unique as the people they govern, and have been around in one form or another for millennia. But did you know that every year approximately five new constitutions are written, and 20-30 are amended or revised? Or that Africa has the youngest set of constitutions, with 19 out of the 39 constitutions written globally since 2000 from the region?  <br />
<br />
The process of redesigning and drafting a new constitution can play a critical role in uniting a country, especially following periods of conflict and instability. In the past, it’s been difficult to access and compare existing constitutional documents and language—which is critical to drafters—because the texts are locked up in libraries or on the hard drives of constitutional experts. Although the process of drafting constitutions has evolved from chisels and stone tablets to pens and modern computers, there has been little innovation in how their content is sourced and referenced. <br />
<br />
With this in mind, <a href=""http://google.com/ideas"">Google Ideas</a> supported the <a href=""http://www.comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/"">Comparative Constitutions Project</a> to build <a href=""https://www.constituteproject.org/#/"">Constitute</a>, a new site that digitizes and makes searchable the world’s constitutions. Constitute enables people to browse and search constitutions via curated and tagged topics, as well as by country and year. The Comparative Constitutions Project cataloged and tagged nearly 350 themes, so people can easily find and compare specific constitutional material. This ranges from the fairly general, such as “Citizenship” and “Foreign Policy,” to the very specific, such as “Suffrage and turnouts” and “Judicial Autonomy and Power.” <br />
<br />
Our aim is to arm drafters with a better tool for constitution design and writing. We also hope citizens will use Constitute to learn more about their own constitutions, and those of countries around the world.<br />

5557005942245679532,,Google Blogs,2013-09-17T09:00:00-07:00,Another windy day in Texas: a new power purchase agreement,"As part of our quest to power our operations with 100% renewable energy, we’ve agreed to purchase the entire output of the 240 MW Happy Hereford wind farm outside of Amarillo, Texas. This agreement represents our fifth long-term agreement and our largest commitment yet; we’ve now contracted for more than 570 MW of wind energy, which is enough energy to power approximately 170,000 U.S. households.<br />
<br />
The Happy Hereford wind farm, which is expected to start producing energy in late 2014, is being developed by <a href=""http://chermacenergy.com/"">Chermac Energy</a>, a small, Native American-owned company based in Oklahoma. The wind farm will provide energy to the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), the regional grid that serves our Mayes County, Okla. data center.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>Some (happy) cows on the future site of the wind farm.&nbsp;</i></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>&nbsp;The cows will still have plenty of room to graze between the turbines.</i></div>
<br />
The structure of this agreement is similar to our earlier commitments in <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/reducing-our-carbon-footprint-with.html"">Iowa</a> and <a href=""http://googlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2011/04/oklahoma-where-wind-comes-sweepin-down_21.html"">Oklahoma</a>. Due to the current structure of the market, we can’t consume the renewable energy produced by the wind farm directly, but the impact on our overall carbon footprint and the amount of renewable energy on the grid is the same as if we could consume it. After purchasing the renewable energy, we’ll retire the renewable energy credits (RECs) and sell the energy itself to the wholesale market. We’ll apply any additional RECs produced under this agreement to reduce our carbon footprint elsewhere.<br />
<br />
This type of power purchase agreement represents one of <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/energy/use/#purchasing"">several ways</a> we’re working to make additional renewable energy available for both our data centers and the communities in which we operate. In Scandinavia, due to the region’s unified power market and grid system, we’re able to <a href=""http://googlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/powering-our-finnish-data-center-with.html"">purchase wind energy in Sweden</a> and directly consume it at our Hamina, Finland data center.  We’re also working with our local utility partners to develop new options. In 2012, we signed an agreement with GRDA, our utility partner in Oklahoma, to <a href=""http://googlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2012/09/more-renewable-energy-for-our-data.html"">green the energy supply</a> to our Oklahoma data center with 48 MW of wind energy from the Canadian Hills Wind Project. Earlier this year, we began <a href=""http://googlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/expanding-options-for-companies-to-buy.html"">working with Duke Energy</a> to develop a new <a href=""http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en/us/green/pdf/renewable-energy-options.pdf"">renewable energy tariff</a>&nbsp;(PDF) in North Carolina.<br />
<br />
We take a comprehensive approach to acquiring renewable energy for our operations. We’ll continue working directly with utility providers, collaborating with industry regulators and pursuing <a href=""http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en/us/green/pdfs/renewable-energy.pdf"">creative agreements</a>&nbsp;(PDF) like the Happy Hereford PPA.<br />

Hear how HALO is using <a href=""http://www.google.com/enterprise/mapsearth/?utm_source=halo9162013&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=entblog"">Google Maps for Business</a> to fight the war against mines, clearing more than 1.4 million landmines worldwide. </i>-Ed.<br />
<br />
When conflicts end, making communities safe and livable often means removing dangerous remnants of war. “Getting mines out of the ground, for good,” as we say at the HALO Trust, has been our mission over the last 25 years. We work in more than a dozen countries and regions across the globe, clearing landmines and other explosives, many of which have been buried underground. While we’ve been in operation for almost three decades, there is still more to be done.  <br />
<br />
In Kosovo, where people are reclaiming their homeland after the conflict in 1999, we’re working in close cooperation with the government and local population to collect and share information about where mines are located. It’s a true community effort—farmers tell us where they’ve seen signs of mines and where accidents have occurred. It’s our job at the HALO Trust to take this data and make it usable, accessible, and visually compelling, so clearance becomes more efficient and happens faster.<br />
<br />
One of our biggest challenges is keeping our field teams safe. We need easy-to-use tools that can help us find, map and clear hazardous areas without putting our operations at risk. Over the years, we’ve continuously improved our mine clearance techniques, including the deployment of <a href=""http://www.google.com/enterprise/mapsearth/products/earthpro.html"">Google Earth Pro</a>.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/mCl0T0PFxgk"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
<br />
Google Earth Pro makes it easier for the HALO team to do the dangerous and detailed work of finding and mapping at-risk areas. Because it’s based on the same technology as Google Maps and Earth, it’s easy for our teams to use and create maps without IT or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system"">GIS</a> expertise. It’s a tool that is familiar to our employees and something they use in their daily lives, so we can start mapping right away.<br />
<br />
The information we gather, including GPS references to landmines in the field, is imported into Earth Pro so that we can plot mine locations. We also use the incredibly detailed satellite imagery in Google Earth to identify and map hazardous areas. These high-resolution maps serve many people: from families who live near mines, to crews who clear them, and donors and other organizations that support us. When donors view the vivid interactive maps of our project areas—with mines so close to schools, farms and houses—they understand why the HALO Trust’s work is so critical.<br />
<br />
Accurate maps from Google Earth Pro mean safer working conditions for our local teams, and faster progress toward our goals. In Kosovo alone, we’ve removed thousands of landmines, cluster munitions and other explosives. And with the help of Google’s mapping tools and our donors, we’ll be able to declare the country mine-free.<br />

This volcanic archipelago is one of the most biodiverse and unique places on the planet, with species that have remarkably adapted to their environment. Through observing the animals, Darwin made key insights that informed his theory of evolution. Here’s a short documentary that captures the 10-day expedition:<br />

Today, in partnership with the Directorate of the <a href=""http://www.galapagospark.org/"">Galapagos National Park</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""http://www.darwinfoundation.org/"">Charles Darwin Foundation</a>, we’re launching the 360-degree images from the Galapagos Islands that <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/capturing-beauty-and-wonder-of.html"">we collected in May</a> with the <a href=""http://www.google.com/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/#trekker"">Street View Trekker</a>.

Their politically charged lyrics combined with their hunger for new rhythms gave them an unparalleled ability to create music that made you think as well as dance. They embraced all genres while still sounding like themselves and redefined what a rock group could accomplish musically, politically and culturally. <br />
<br />
From the reggae-inspired social commentary of tracks like “White Man in Hammersmith Palais,” to hip-hop infused cuts like “Magnificent Seven” and even Top 40 hits such as “Rock the Casbah,” their <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/music/album?id=Bgkypnhu5euejjouimttlkewfma"">songs</a> gave a generation a lifelong connection not just to the Clash, but to music in general.<br />
<br />
From time to time, Google Play <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irElqdYUfZs"">teams up with iconic rockers</a> to help tell their stories. When we heard that the Clash were planning to re-release some of their greatest music, we wanted to celebrate their legacy and create something cool for their fans around the world. They handed over hours of unseen footage of the late Joe Strummer discussing the arc of the band’s career. And the Google Play team interviewed the rest of the members to get their perspective on what they accomplished and how they did it. The result is “Audio Ammunition,” a free, five-part documentary about the Clash that walks through the writing, recording and reception of each of their classic studio albums. <br />
<br />
Watch part one of the documentary on <a href=""http://play.google.com/store/music/collection/promotion_20002d7_vid_clash_doc"">Google Play</a>, and you can check out the other four parts on our YouTube channel at <a href=""http://youtube.com/googleplay"">youtube.com/googleplay</a>. You can also buy all five of their newly released, digitally remastered albums on Google Play. And because the Clash’s legacy continues to inspire musicians today, we’ve produced some exclusive cover versions by contemporary artists we admire. These four tracks are available as free downloads for a limited time on Google Play.<br />
<br />
The Clash explored a world of ever-expanding rhythms and possibilities and the urgency and power of their music still resonates today. As bassist Paul Simonon says. “We weren’t concerned with playing just on our doorstep. It was to play on any doorstep, throughout the world.”<br />

Strong passwords help protect your accounts and information on the web. But forgetting your password is like losing your keys—you can end up locked out of your own home. It gets worse if your password gets compromised or stolen. Sometimes the thief will change your password so you can't get back into your own account—kind of like someone stealing your keys and then changing the lock. <br />
<br />
If you've lost your Google password, you need a way to get back into your Google Account—and back to all of your stuff in Gmail, Maps, Google+ and YouTube. To help you, Google needs to be able to tell that you’re the rightful account owner even if you don't have the right password. There are a few easy steps you can take right now to make it easy for you—and no one else—to get into your Google Account if you forget or don’t know the password. <br />
<br />
<b>1. Add a recovery email address. </b>By registering an alternate email address with your <a href=""https://www.google.com/settings/account"">Google Account settings</a>, you’re giving Google another way to reach you. If you forget your password, Google can send a link to that recovery email address so you can reset your password.

Methods like “secret” questions (asking your mother’s maiden name or city where you were born) may have answers that are easy to remember, but they are also possible for bad guys to uncover. And we’ve consistently seen that people who register a recovery phone are faster and more successful at getting their accounts back than those recovering their accounts via email. <br />
<br />
You can also get a text message if Google detects that something suspicious is going on with your account. Giving a recovery phone number to Google won’t result in you being signed up for marketing lists or getting more calls from telemarketers.<br />
<br />
<b>3. Keep your recovery options up to date. </b>It’s a good idea to check your recovery options every so often. For example, if you change your phone number after setting up your recovery options, take just a minute to update your recovery settings to match. We'll remind you of your current settings every so often to make it easier for you to keep them up to date. <br />
<br />
That’s it! You can either update your recovery options next time you’re prompted, or you can take two minutes to do it right now on our <a href=""http://accounts.google.com/UpdateAccountRecoveryOptions"">Account recovery options page</a>.

This petition mirrors the requests made to Congress and the President by our industry and civil liberties groups in a <a href=""https://www.cdt.org/files/pdfs/weneedtoknow-transparency-letter.pdf"">letter</a>&nbsp;(PDF) earlier this year.  Namely, that Google be allowed to publish detailed statistics about the types (if any) of national security requests we receive under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, including Section 702.  Given the important public policy issues at stake, we have also asked the court to hold its hearing in open rather than behind closed doors.  It’s time for more transparency. <br />
<br />
In addition, along with a number of other companies and trade associations, we are meeting the President’s Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies today.  We’ll reiterate the same message there: that the levels of secrecy that have built up around national security requests undermine the basic freedoms that are at the heart of a democratic society.   <br />

2408335765600840374,,Google Blogs,2013-09-03T13:03:00-07:00,An intern’s summer experience: Support from employee resource groups ,"With <i><a href=""http://www.theinternshipmovie.com/"">The Internship</a></i> premiering just days before I started my intern orientation at Google, my friends were more excited about my summer job than one might normally expect. But my internship was special for reasons beyond the Hollywood notoriety that accompanied my arrival to Mountain View. One of those reasons was the active presence of Google’s <a href=""http://www.google.com/diversity/"">Employee Resource Groups</a> (ERGs) and how welcoming they’ve been to interns. <br />
<br />
Open to Googlers everywhere, ERGs are grassroots networks with shared values of supporting diversity and inclusion throughout our company and our communities. Surprised to discover that 20+ unique ERGs existed to begin with, I was relieved when I found out that interns, who are treated like full-time Googlers, could participate in them as well.<br />
<br />
From ice cream socials to BBQs and salsa dancing, ERGs gave us opportunities to get to know Googlers from different seniority levels and functions—while having fun! The events I attended brought interns together with entry-level Googlers, managers, directors and senior VPs; Googlers in sales, marketing, people operations, global business, small business (SMB) services and engineering. <br />
<br />
While many ERG events are social, Googlers in these groups also have a deep impact on social issues and the company at large. In light of the DOMA decision in June, Gayglers rallied the entire office for San Francisco’s Pride parade. Some of my fellow interns described the parade as a highlight. Shawn Saunders, a senior at Brown University and SMB services intern, told me “through the Gayglers, I was able to find a community of queer and allied Googlers who really helped color my experiences at Google.”<br />
<br />

The Special Needs Network engaged interns in this summer’s Disability Pride Parade. Aubrie Lee, a senior at Stanford University and people operations intern, told me the Googlers in the Special Needs Network “with or without disabilities—understand that diversity is not just about color or orientation. They are my allies in fighting stigma, both in the world and at work.""<br />

<br />
In response to the Trayvon Martin verdict, the Black Googler’s Network (BGN) organized a hoodie march on campus to raise awareness around unconscious bias and racial profiling. The march had a profound impact on me in showing the value of community and support among black Googlers. As Tanisha Hospedale, a senior at the University of Pennsylvania and People Operations intern, said, “I am very grateful for BGN and the family I have made from being a part of this group.”<br />

<br />
One major takeaway from my internship is that Google continues to be a place where Googlers can bring their total selves to work while also having strong, supportive communities to fall back on. “I can tell that Google doesn't just talk about a commitment to diversity and inclusion, but actually demonstrates this through supporting ERGs,” said Jasmine McElroy, a senior at Howard University and People Operations intern. “These groups have made me feel like I belong here.”<br />

<br />
This is the type of challenge that was posed to the finalists of our 10th annual Code Jam last week. Twenty-four of the world’s best coders were flown to London to compete for the title of Code Jam Champion 2013 and the accompanying $15,000.<br />
<br />
Belarus's Ivan Miatselski, a.k.a. “mystic,” was crowned Champion, besting more than 45,000 other registrants and making it through four online qualifying rounds before winning the in-person finals. The final round was a four-hour, <a href=""https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/2437491/dashboard#s=p0"">five-problem</a> tour de code. Throughout Code Jam, contestants are allowed to use <a href=""http://www.go-hero.net/jam/13/round/0"">any programming language</a> and any development environment they like, ranging from C++ to <a href=""http://esolangs.org/wiki/Taxi"">Taxi</a>. And while the finalists are among the among the most talented, we’ve yet to see anyone earn a perfect score during the final round.<br />
<br />
Successfully solving the problems involves more than just writing code: contestants in this year's finals needed mastery of computational geometry, dynamic programming, numerical algorithms and more. Though the competition is fierce, Code Jam is also a growing community of skilled problem-solvers, engineers and friends from all over the world. Code Jam will be back in 2014—join our <a href=""https://plus.sandbox.google.com/communities/108868943712030139628"">community</a> on Google+ and look for  more news to come.<br />

They can help <a href=""http://www.pointsoflight.org/our-partners/partner-spotlight/google/2013"">improve family literacy</a>, support veterans as they <a href=""http://www.handsonnetwork.org/news-flash-handson-tech-lifts-transition-house"">transition out of homelessness</a>, or help communities <a href=""http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-south/communities-often-can-find-grants-to-fund-all-kinds-of-projects-692329/"">make information more accessible</a>. Unfortunately, nonprofits often lack the resources to fully take advantage of technology to further their causes.<br />
<br />
Two years ago we partnered with <a href=""http://www.pointsoflight.org/"">Points of Light</a> to address this problem. With the support of the Corporation for National and Community Service, we created <a href=""http://www.pointsoflight.org/programs/handson-tech"">HandsOn Tech</a>, an initiative with a mission to develop the nonprofit sector’s ability to use technology to increase community resources and improve outcomes for low-income communities and families. <br />
<br />
Fueled by the passion and skills of <a href=""http://www.americorps.gov/for_individuals/choose/vista.asp"">AmeriCorps VISTA</a> members, HandsOn Tech pairs U.S. nonprofits with individuals who are passionate about technology and looking to make a difference. Through this program VISTA members and skilled volunteers (including many Googlers) deliver training to poverty-focused nonprofits and work one-on-one with organizations to create individualized, comprehensive tech plans to help them achieve their social missions more efficiently and effectively.<br />

In the first two years of the program, VISTA members and skills-based volunteers have trained more than 7,700 nonprofit organizations in communities across the country. For example, VISTAs from a HandsOn Tech program in Pittsburgh worked with <a href=""http://naomisplace.org/"">Naomi’s Place</a> (an organization that provides transitional housing and supportive services to homeless women) to enhance their website, set up Google Apps, and develop a new Facebook page. The program also helps VISTA members and volunteers learn new skills. Alex Green, who served as a VISTA in Seattle, Wash., told us: ""Apart from building awareness and ability in the community in terms of IT needs, I have also had the opportunity to grow myself as a person in all aspects of my life.""<br />

HandsOn Tech begins its third year this fall with programs in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Pittsburgh, San Jose, Seattle, Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City and San Jose. Prior to beginning their service, VISTA members come together for a week of training at our campus in Mountain View, Calif., where they learn about cloud-based tools from a variety of technology companies including the <a href=""http://www.google.com/nonprofits/"">Google for Nonprofits</a> suite that provides nonprofits with access to premium versions of Google Apps, Google Earth and YouTube channels as well as free online advertising. <br />
<br />
A few openings still exist for VISTA members to begin serving in November in select cities.

Or wanted to just quickly see whether your package would arrive on time, without having to look up the tracking info first? You’ve told us it would be much easier if you could skip the fuss and just ask Google. <br />
<br />
Soon you’ll be able to find this info instantly in Google Search if it’s in your Gmail, Google Calendar or Google+. For example, just ask or type, “What’s my flight status?” or “When will my package arrive?”<br />

Over the next several days, we’ll be rolling this out to all U.S., English-speaking users on desktop, tablet and smartphone, with voice search (so you don’t have to type). Here are just a few of the time savers that will be available this week, with more to come:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Flights:</b> Ask Google “Is my flight on time?” to get info on your upcoming flights and live status on your current flights.</li>
<li><b>Reservations: </b>Ask for “my reservations” to see your dining plans or “my hotel” to get your hotel name and address. With one tap, you can get driving or public transit directions straight there, saving you lots of steps.</li>
<li><b>Purchases:</b> Ask for “my purchases,” and you’ll get the status of your current orders, so you know whether your mom’s birthday present will arrive on time.</li>
<li><b>Plans:</b> Ask Google “What are my plans for tomorrow?” to see a summary of upcoming flights, hotels, restaurant reservations and events—very useful when you’re traveling.</li>
<li><b>Photos:</b> Say “Show me my photos from Thailand” to see the photos you uploaded to Google+. You can also ask for “my photos of sunsets” if you want to show off the shots you’ve taken over the year; Google will try to automatically recognize the type of photo you’re asking for.</li>
</ul>
<br />
We’ve been offering this kind of info—flights, reservations, appointments and more—for more than a year in <a href=""http://www.google.com/now/"">Google Now</a>. We’ve gotten great feedback on how convenient it is, especially when you’re on the go. Now that it’s in Google Search, you can get it anytime you need it.<br />
<br />
This information is just for you—secure, via encrypted connection, and visible only to you when you're signed in to Google. Likewise, you can also control whether you want the service on or off. Whenever you don’t want to see it, simply click the globe icon at the top of the search results page to turn it off for that search session. To turn it off permanently, visit the ""Private results"" section in <a href=""https://www.google.com/preferences"">search settings</a>.<br />
<br />
We hope this makes your day a little easier. Visit our <a href=""http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/myanswers"">Inside Search site</a> to learn more about the questions you can ask.<br />

","<i>This summer we’re <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/search/label/security%20and%20safety%20tips"">posting regularly</a> with privacy and security tips. Knowing how to stay safe and secure online is important, which is why we created our Good to Know site with advice and tips for safe and savvy Internet use.</i> -Ed.<br />
<br />
With summer vacation in full swing, you’re likely out and about, using your smartphone or tablet to get answers on the go or check out the latest cool apps and games. But you don’t have to leave safety at home! In this post, we’re sharing a few tips and tools that you can easily set up if you’re on an Android phone or tablet to keep your device—and the contents inside—safe and secure, including a new service that makes it easy to locate a misplaced device.<br />
<br />
<b>1. Lock your device screen. </b>Whether you’re on a phone or a tablet, it’s easy to set up a <a href=""http://support.google.com/nexus/4/answer/2819522"">screen lock</a>. This is important to do in case your device gets left in the back of a car, or you’re worried about someone picking up your phone and scrolling through your stuff. You can lock your device with a pin, password, pattern (or even <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l4D2tn_-kQ"">your face</a>!) by going to Settings &gt; Personal &gt; Security &gt; Screen Lock.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

<b>2. Protect your phone from suspicious apps. </b>We automatically scan Google Play to block and remove harmful apps. That makes Google Play the safest place to get Android apps. But Google Play can also help <a href=""https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/2812853?hl=en"">protect you</a> even for apps you get elsewhere, like the web or a third-party app store. The first time you start to install an app from an unknown source, a message will pop up asking if you’d like Google to scan the file to make sure it’s not harmful. Tap “OK” to let Google help protect you from harmful apps.<br />
<br />
<b>3. Locate, ring and wipe a misplaced device. </b>Have you ever lost your phone in between the couch cushions or left it in a restaurant? Later this month, you will be able to use a new service called Android Device Manager, which can quickly ring your phone at maximum volume so you can find it (even if it’s been silenced), or locate it on a map, in real time, using Android Device Manager. If your phone can’t be recovered, or has been stolen, you can quickly and securely erase all of the data on your device to keep your data from ending up in the wrong hands. The Android Device Manager will be available for devices running Android 2.2 and above, as part of Google Play. You can read the full announcement on the <a href=""http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2013/08/find-your-lost-phone-with-android.html"">Android blog</a>.<br />

<br />
In 2013, 30 organizations <a href=""http://www.google.com/edu/programs/google-rise-awards/index.html#!award-recipients"">received</a> RISE grants—with projects ranging from robotics contests in Germany to programming challenge days for girls in New Zealand.  In June, we brought all of our partners together for a Global Summit. It was an inspiring meeting, and since the Summit several organizations have begun to work together to expand their reach. <br />
<br />
For example, our RISE partners in Nigeria, <a href=""http://www.waawfoundation.org/"">WAAW Foundation</a> and <a href=""http://www.w-teconline.org/"">W-TEC</a>, have teamed up to organize a one-week residential Advanced STEM Camp.

3948595837226907131,,Google Blogs,2013-07-24T10:14:00-07:00,"From TVs to tablets: Everything you love, across all your screens","When I was growing up, my family had a single screen we huddled around every day: the television set in the living room. Nowadays, we “huddle” around multiple screens—laptops, smartphones and tablets—using them almost interchangeably as we navigate through our day. In a world of ubiquitous computing, life would be a lot simpler if we didn’t have to learn new behaviors and interfaces each time we switched screens—if we could have one consistent, intuitive experience no matter where we are or what we’re doing. Today, with the launch of <a href=""http://www.google.com/chromecast"">Chromecast</a> and the <a href=""http://www.google.com/nexus/7/index.html"">new Nexus 7 tablet</a>, it’s even more effortless to enjoy content you care about—whether it’s video, music, movies, games—wherever you are, across your devices.<br />
<br />
<b>Introducing Chromecast</b><br />
To help make it easy to bring your favorite online entertainment to the biggest screen in your house—the TV—we’re introducing Chromecast. Chromecast is a small and affordable ($35) device that you simply plug in to your high-definition (HD) TV and it allows you to use your phone, tablet or laptop to ""cast"" online content to your TV screen. It works with Netflix, YouTube, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, and Google Play Music, with more apps like Pandora coming soon. With Chromecast, we wanted to create an easy solution that works for everyone, for every TV in the house.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5dvaoY0mDAI/Ue_9CW_mSsI/AAAAAAAAMzw/logZ9hcFDak/s1600/chromecast.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""400"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5dvaoY0mDAI/Ue_9CW_mSsI/AAAAAAAAMzw/logZ9hcFDak/s400/chromecast.png"" width=""378"" /></a></div><br />
<b>Remote-free</b><br />
Once your Chromecast is set up, you can use your phone, tablet or laptop to browse and cast content to your TV, play and pause, control the volume, and more. But unlike other streaming solutions, you can still multitask—send emails or surf the web—while enjoying what’s on the TV screen. It works across platforms—Android tablets and smartphones, iPhones, iPads, Chrome for Mac and Windows (more to come), so your personal device is also now your remote control.<br />
<br />
<b>Cast the web to your TV</b><br />
In addition to apps like Netflix, you can use Chromecast to bring a broad range of content available on the web to your big screen, thanks to a new feature in the Chrome browser that allows you to project any browser tab to your TV. From sharing your family photos to enjoying a video clip from your favorite news site, it’s as simple as pressing a button. This feature is launching in beta, but we’re excited for people to try it out and give us their feedback.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/cKG5HDyTW8o"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
<b>Google Cast SDK preview for developers</b><br />
To ensure a great Chromecast experience over time, we've built Google Cast, a technology that enables developers to build consistent, intuitive multi-screen experiences across mobile devices and TVs. Today, we’re launching a preview version of Google Cast with more information for developers on our <a href=""http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2013/07/cast-content-from-your-apps-to-tv-with.html"">Google Developers blog</a>. A handful of early developers are already working on enabling Google Cast technology in their apps, so more supported apps are coming soon. And while the Chromecast device is the first instantiation of Google Cast, we expect the technology to be embedded in a range of hardware from our partners in the future.<br />

Together with ASUS, we took what you loved about the <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/android-io-playground-is-open.html"">original Nexus 7</a> and made it even better. The first thing you’ll notice is the sharpness of the screen: the 323 pixels packed into every inch of the screen makes it the world's highest-resolution 7-inch tablet. It’s lighter than ever, with more than nine hours of HD video playback and 10 hours of web browsing or reading. Nexus 7 now features stereo speakers and virtual surround sound from Fraunhofer (the inventors of the MP3 format), giving you rich and immersive audio.<br />
<br />
<b>Android 4.3—a sweeter Jelly Bean</b><br />
Nexus 7 is the first device to ship with <a href=""http://www.android.com/about/jelly-bean/"">Android 4.3</a>, the newest version of Android. Tablets are perfect for sharing with others, so in Android 4.3, we're introducing restricted profiles, which let you limit access to apps and content. For example, restricted profiles enable parental controls, so certain family members are prevented from accessing mature content. Likewise, retail stores can use tablets to show off product information, and shops can use tablets as point of sale systems. Android 4.3 also now supports <a href=""http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart-Devices.aspx"">Bluetooth Smart</a> technology, opening the door to mobile apps that connect to new devices like fitness sensors. Android 4.3 is rolling out to Nexus devices starting today.<br />
<br />
<b>Ready to Play</b><br />
The new <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.play.games"">Google Play Games</a> app brings your friends together with the games you love, where you can invite a friend and start challenging gamers around the world, compete for top achievements, and race to the top of the leaderboard. You can also enjoy the world’s largest collection of eBooks, listen to millions of music tracks and immerse yourself in thousands of movies, TV shows, magazines and apps on Google Play. Plus, Nexus 7 comes loaded with your favorite Google apps, like Chrome, Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Now. <br />

2880973740522780457,,Google Blogs,2013-07-17T09:35:00-07:00,Campus for Moms: Helping women entrepreneurs in Israel,"Since opening our <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/12/supporting-israels-start-up-nation.html"">Campus Tel Aviv</a> last December, we’ve hosted thousands of promising entrepreneurs and developers at events, workshops, lectures and hackathons. Many of these entrepreneurs refer to their start-ups as their “baby,” and it’s easy to understand why. Like having a newborn, a start-up is super-exciting, yet the days are hectic and the nights are... sleepless. <br />
<br />
What’s really inspiring (and just a little bit crazy) is that some people do both at the same time. Take, for example, Israeli entrepreneur <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Yazamiyot/members/10613255/"">Hilla Brenner</a>, who raised $5 million for her first start-up when she was nine months pregnant. Earlier this year, I had the chance to meet Hilla and we began talking about how juggling work and kids doesn’t leave much time to invest in learning and developing new skills. We also discussed how maternity leave can be one of the few times when women can stop and think about their career. We asked ourselves: what could we do to help women with young children get access to self-development and career support and, in doing so, to help more women become tech entrepreneurs? <br />
<br />
<a href=""http://www.google.com/entrepreneurs/initiatives/campus-tlv-moms.html"">Campus for Moms</a> is a baby-friendly start-up school for new moms, run by Google in partnership with <a href=""http://yazamiyot.com/"">Yazamiyot</a>, a networking group for Israeli women entrepreneurs. The first course, which ended this week, included nine sessions led by successful entrepreneurs, investors, technology experts and others. The sessions covered personal success stories, finance, legal and presentation skills, and tech knowledge, like cloud computing. We arranged mattresses, bean bags and diaper-changing facilities so that the moms could take care of their young ones during the sessions. Four babies were born during the course and one new mum returned to the program less than a week after giving birth! <br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/I7QBrFShv8o"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
At the end of the course, participants presented their initiatives to venture capital funds and the course speakers. Their ideas are exciting—including a platform for teachers to create apps for their students, a <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Fash-Tech/"">fashion-tech meet up</a> to encourage cooperation between local fashion-related start-ups, a 2G mobile ecommerce gateway for emerging markets and a bunch of other great initiatives. <br />
<br />
The participants are continuing to develop their skills: two of the start-ups have joined the <a href=""http://www.campustelaviv.com/programs/"">Campus Tel Aviv “Launch Pad”</a> program, an intensive week-long bootcamp for entrepreneurs, and another will be visiting <a href=""http://www.campuslondon.com/"">Campus London</a> to meet with U.K.-based entrepreneurs. <br />

The first course of “Campus for Moms” is over, but we’re gearing up for <a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/1KBsWY1Qa75EreAamzQcXC1vV_yMLKQ9ijPtHhDcJcL0/viewform"">another course</a> in October. We're also looking forward to sharing the tools and best practices we've developed at Campus for Moms with others, so they can help entrepreneurial moms in their communities. After all, whether they’re moms or not, entrepreneurs can always do with a helping hand with their “baby.”<br />

The highest monument in the world for more than 40 years (today that title is held by <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/experience-stunning-new-heights-with.html"">Burj Khalifa</a> in Dubai), the Eiffel Tower remains the most visited monument globally. But not everyone has been or can hope to go—until now. If you’ve ever wondered what the view is like from above the City of Light or wanted to learn more about the Tower’s history, now’s your chance to find out. <br />
<br />
The <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/home"">Google Cultural Institute</a> and the Eiffel Tower Operating Company have teamed up to create three immersive online exhibitions which blend fascinating historical material with a sprinkling of technological magic. In order to capture the imagery, the Street View team followed in the footsteps of 7 million annual visitors and ascended multiple floors of the Tower. Using the Street View <a href=""http://maps.google.com/intl/ALL_en/help/maps/streetview/learn/cars-trikes-and-more.html#trolley"">Trolley</a> (designed especially for monuments and museums) they filmed 360-degree views of the monument’s architecture and its views over Paris.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/fsNvRhLWuBE?rel=0&amp;cc_load_policy=1"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
These <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/tour-eiffel?museumview"">modern-day Street View panoramas</a> sit alongside nearly <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/tour-eiffel?v.view=grid"">50 archival images, plans, engravings and photos</a> telling the story of the Eiffel Tower’s development and social impact in the 19th century. Some of the archive material is quite rare and precious such as a <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/enregistrement-de-la-voix-de-gustave-eiffel-par-thomas-edison/eQEeI9E8UyZdQw"">recording of Gustave Eiffel’s voice by Thomas Edison</a>. <br />
<br />
The first exhibition presents <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/AQJMpLxJ"">the birth of the Eiffel Tower</a> from the initial idea until its realization. You can then follow <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/the-construction-of-the-eiffel-tower/AQIqOkVv"">the construction</a> of the monument step-by-step through photos and sketches. Details on <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/AQLhwHRz"">the inauguration and the first visitors</a> lie in the third exhibition, with photos of <a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/visiteurs-de-la-tour-eiffel-admirant-paris/IQHxx9x4T82n_g"">people admiring the Paris vista</a> on the opening day leading into today’s Street View imagery from the top floor. Did you know that during the Tower’s inauguration for the Universal Exhibition of 1889, the elevators were not yet in service but 12,000 people per day rushed to climb the 1710 steps leading to the top? <br />
<br />

<br />
As a product manager and designer, it’s been awe-inspiring to get to see the spectacular vision and the detailed architectural capabilities exemplified by the plans more than 100 years ago. It required tremendous knowledge of special planning and physics to ensure that 18,000 separately made pieces would come together as one.

710316940196438349,,Google Blogs,2013-07-10T01:30:00-07:00,A new Google Maps app for smartphones and tablets,"Today we’re introducing a new Google Maps app for Android smartphones and tablets, also coming soon to iPhone and iPad. It’s a new mapping experience that makes exploring the world and getting to the places that matter to you a lot faster and easier. The app is gradually rolling out globally in <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5nb29nbGUuYW5kcm9pZC5hcHBzLm1hcHMiXQ.."">Google Play</a> and will be available soon in the <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/app/id585027354"">App Store</a>.<br />
<br />
The new Google Maps for mobile builds on the design we released for iPhone last December and improves on it with a few useful search and navigation features. And it's the first dedicated app for Android tablets and iPads. We’re also retiring Latitude and are making some changes to offline and My Maps which we’ll explain in more detail below. <br />
<br />
First, here are a few highlights that make this release stand out:<br />
<br />
<b>Explore: </b>Explore is a fast and easy way to visually browse and discover new places without even typing. Simply tap the search box and you’ll see cards showing great places to eat, drink, sleep and shop. <br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

<b>Enhanced navigation: </b>In addition to current traffic conditions, we’ve added two new features to help you navigate around traffic. You can now see reports of problems on the road that you can tap to see incident details. While on the road, Google Maps will also alert you if a better route becomes available and reroute you to your destination faster. This feature is available only on Android and is coming soon to iOS.<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

<b>Designed for tablets: </b>A dedicated tablet design brings all the features of this new app to Android tablets and iPads, which makes exploring the world from the comfort of your living room much more fluid, smooth and fun.<br />

<b>Reviews, Zagat and Offers: </b>There’s a new 5.0 star rating system that gives you a quick read on how your friends and others rate places like restaurants, bars and cafes. For an expert’s opinion, the Zagat badge of excellence and curated lists are integrated into search results so you can quickly spot the very best places. From “Best Restaurants to meet for a drink in NYC” to “Best Restaurants in the Mission” in San Francisco, Zagat’s there to help you uncover the local gems.<br />

And finally, Google Maps for mobile is a great way to <a href=""http://googlecommerce.blogspot.com/2013/07/discover-offers-with-google-and-save-on.html"">discover valuable Offers</a> from national brands like Macy's, Michael's and Toys ""R"" Us, labeled right on the map. All these features can make it a lot easier to navigate the world, no matter what adventure comes your way.<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/oVg7hx3srzo"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
One important change you should know about is that Latitude and check-ins will be retired.  These features will no longer be a part of the new Google Maps app, and will stop functioning in older versions by August 9. We understand some of you still want to see your friends and family on a map, which is why <a href=""http://googleplusproject.blogspot.com/2013/05/google-for-android-42.html"">we've added</a> location sharing and check-ins to Google+ for Android (coming soon to iOS). More details about Latitude and check-in changes can be found in our <a href=""http://support.google.com/gmm/?p=maps_android_latitude"">help center</a>. <br />
<br />
The offline maps feature for Android is also no longer available. Instead we’ve created a new way for you to access maps offline by simply entering “OK Maps” into the search box when viewing the area you want for later. Finally, My Maps functionality is not supported in this release but will return to future versions of the app. People who want to create powerful custom maps can still do so with <a href=""http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2013/03/create-collaborate-and-share-advanced.html"">Maps Engine Lite</a> on desktop.<br />
<br />
Helping you find great places is what we love to do. And as more of us use mobile phones and tablets in our daily lives, information that’s useful to you isn't just about <i>what</i> you need, but also <i>where</i> you might find it. Today’s update is an exciting step forward for Google’s maps—one that we hope will make it faster and easier for you to explore and discover places you want to go. <br />
<br />
Update July 16: The new Google Maps app for iPhone and iPad is now live. Visit the <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8"">App Store</a> today to download it. <br />

Knowing how to stay safe and secure online is important, which is why we created our Good to Know site with advice and tips for safe and savvy Internet use.</i> -Ed.<br />
<br />
Summer is here, and with kids out of school it is a great time for families to explore the web together—from learning what makes fireflies glow to playing online games together. But while there is a lot of entertaining, educational content online, there are also materials I’d rather not see when I’m surfing the web with my family. Google has built a number of tools that parents can use to help keep content they would rather not see from popping up on the family computer. It takes less than five minutes to turn them on, so follow the steps below to help make your search results more family-friendly this summer. <br />
<br />
<b>1. Turn on SafeSearch in Google Search</b><br />
Turning on <a href=""https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/510?hl=en#"">SafeSearch</a> is an easy way to help you hide images, search results and videos intended just for adults. It’s especially helpful if you’re concerned about the content that might pop up on your family computer, and it’s easy to turn on. Just visit the Google <a href=""http://www.google.com/preferences"">Search Settings page</a>, go to the ""SafeSearch filters"" section, and check the box to filter mature content from Google Search result pages. These preferences will apply for any searches done using that browser on your computer. If you have multiple browsers on your family computer, you might want to turn SafeSearch on for each one.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j_1JZ5ZCDdE/UdwvAk8nWHI/AAAAAAAAMto/Z01kSWmfhlk/s1600/safesearch.jpeg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j_1JZ5ZCDdE/UdwvAk8nWHI/AAAAAAAAMto/Z01kSWmfhlk/s1600/safesearch.jpeg"" /></a></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i>You can turn SafeSearch on or off from the <a href=""http://www.google.com/preferences"">Search Settings page</a></i></div><br />
<b>2. Save and lock your preferences</b><br />
Once you’ve set your preferences, make sure to click the Save button at the bottom of the page. And if you're signed in to your Google Account, you can also lock the SafeSearch filter so others can’t change your preferences—just click “Lock SafeSearch.” Now the setting is protected with your Google Account password. While no filter is 100 percent perfect, with SafeSearch on you can feel more confident browsing the web with your family. <br />
<br />
<b>3. Turn on YouTube Safety Mode </b><br />
<a href=""http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=174084"">YouTube Safety Mode</a> helps you and your family avoid videos that might be OK with our <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines"">Community Guidelines</a>, but you might not want popping up on your family computer. Turning on Safety Mode in YouTube takes just one step. Scroll down to the bottom of any YouTube page and click on the button that says “Safety” at the bottom of the page—now you can choose your preferences for Safety Mode. <br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RYlMiqP3_-w/UdwvBPDkakI/AAAAAAAAMt4/BhUVjWf1S-M/s1600/youtube+safety.jpeg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""366"" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RYlMiqP3_-w/UdwvBPDkakI/AAAAAAAAMt4/BhUVjWf1S-M/s640/youtube+safety.jpeg"" width=""640"" /></a></div><br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><i>Click the button that says “Safety” at the bottom of any YouTube page, and then choose your preferences</i></div><br />
<b>4. Lock your Safety Mode preferences</b><br />
Just like with Safe Search, you can also log in with your Google Account and <a href=""http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=174084"">lock YouTube Safety Mode</a> on each one of your computer’s browsers. It will filter videos with mature content, so they won’t show up in video search results, related videos, playlists, shows or films. YouTube Safety Mode will also help hide objectionable comments.<br />
<br />
<b>5. Turn on SafeSearch on mobile</b><br />
SafeSearch is available on your phone or other mobile device, as well as the web. You can turn on SafeSearch for Google on your mobile device by opening your phone’s browser and visiting <a href=""http://google.com/preferences"">google.com/preferences</a>. Scroll to the SafeSearch Filters section to select what level of filtering you would like to enable. Be sure to tap “Save Preferences” after you’ve made your selection. <br />
<br />
To enable SafeSearch on YouTube’s mobile app, first open your settings, then press “Search.” From there, select “SafeSearch Filtering” and select moderate or strict filtering. <br />
<br />
Helping your family have a positive and safe experience with Google is important to you, and it’s important to us, too. That’s why we’ve partnered with parents and experts on free and easy to use tools and resources to help your family stay safe and secure when browsing online. If you’re interested in even more of our tools and tips, please see our <a href=""http://www.google.com/goodtoknow/"">Good to Know</a> site, and stay tuned for more security tips throughout the summer.<br />

7092240682925601171,,Google Blogs,2013-07-08T08:00:00-07:00,Supercharge your summer at Maker Camp,"<i>We’re pleased to have Dale Dougherty, founder and publisher of <a href=""http://makezine.com/"">MAKE magazine</a> and <a href=""http://makerfaire.com/"">Maker Faire</a>, join us today to talk about Maker Camp—a free, online summer camp for teens on Google+. Last year, more than 1 million campers joined in, and this summer is looking even brighter. Maker Camp will officially kick off at 11 a.m. PDT / 2 p.m. EDT today in a live <a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/1/events/c4ofgr2dgpjpql4t2njondc05ig"">Hangout On Air</a> from San Francisco’s Exploratorium and will go on for the next six weeks.  - Ed.</i><br />
<br />
Camping has long been a summer tradition that calls us to explore the outdoors, engage in fun activities and make new friends. Overnight camping might involve setting up tents and gathering around a campfire, while day camps can focus on areas of interest such as chess, computers, robotics or sports (we’ve worked with a lot of these at Maker Media). Yet no matter what kind of camp it is, or where it takes place, camp has to be fun and social. <br />
<br />
<a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/1/+MAKE/posts"">Maker Camp</a> is a whole new kind of camp: an online summer camp that is completely free and open to everyone. Maker Camp takes place wherever you are, by letting you do fun activities and share them with others through the Google+ platform. You’ll make cool projects, go on epic virtual “field trips” and meet awesome makers. <br />
<br />
This is Maker Camp’s second summer, and the format is similar: Each weekday morning, we’ll post a new project or activity on our Google+ page—30 things to make over six weeks. Each weekday afternoon, tune in to a live Google+ Hangout On Air to meet expert makers who create amazing things. And like last year, our Field Trip Friday Hangouts will take you to new places that few of us get to see. For instance, we’re excited to take you to NASA Ames Research Center next week, and this week we’ll be checking out one of the world’s fastest sailboats, from Oracle Team USA. <br />
<br />
We’ve added a few things to make this year's Maker Camp even better. There's a new <a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/107377046073638428310"">Google+ Community for Maker Camp</a>, so it will be even easier for you to chat with other campers and see what they’re working on. We also have a network of affiliate camps (we call them “campsites”), so you can create and make together in your local library, youth club or makerspace. If there’s a campsite near you, you’ll find it <a href=""http://makezine.com/maker-camp/affiliate-map/"">on this map</a>. We’ve worked with Google to supply many of these campsites with maker equipment like soldering kits, LEDs, <a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/1/+raspberrypi/posts"">Raspberry Pi boards</a> (mini Linux computers), and <a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/1/+Arduino/posts"">Arduino microcontrollers</a> (good for making robots and other gadgets). <br />
<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/NkJqM4YOPRA"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
<br />
Maker Camp hopes to foster the DIY (do-it-yourself) spirit in young people. We want each camper to see how much there is that you can do and how much there is to explore all around you. Once you begin doing things, you’ll meet others who share your interests, and you can collaborate to work on projects together. We call that DIT (do-it-together). Google+ is a platform for that kind of collaboration, and it extends to any location and any time zone. And when Maker Camp comes to an end, you’ll have friendships that last beyond summer.<br />
<br />
Maker Camp might not be surrounded by trees or near a lake, but it has many of the wonderful features of camping. For instance, you can think of your computer as the campfire that we gather around, and with more than a million campers, our virtual campfire is pretty big! Plus, like any camp, you’ll get the most out of Maker Camp by participating. Meet other makers, get involved in conversations, do things you’ve never done before and most of all, make something!<br />
<br />
What each of us can do is pretty amazing, yet what we can do together is even more amazing. In that spirit, I invite you all to join us at Maker Camp, starting today. Just follow <a href=""http://google.com/+make"">Make on Google+</a> to join, and let’s make this the best summer ever.<br />

Pride had a special buzz this year, as DOMA and Prop 8 were struck down by the Supreme Court three days before the parades, marking an important step toward equal rights for all. <br />
<br />
We supported our fellow Gayglers and others around the world with recording-breaking attendance at parades in San Francisco (well over 1300 Googlers and allies) and New York (500+ participants). In other parts of the world, we marched in celebrations in London, Budapest, Dublin, Tel Aviv, and <a href=""http://www.tokyorainbowweek.jp/"">Tokyo Rainbow Week 2013</a>. We floated along the canals in Amsterdam Pride parade, marched in the Mardi Gras parade in Sydney and will gather in Hong Lim park for Singapore's 3rd annual <a href=""http://pinkdot.sg/"">Pink Dot celebration</a>.<br />

<li>LGBT celebrations were held for the first time in Hyderabad and Google was there! In India, our contingent of over 30 people made it to the <a href=""http://www.deccanchronicle.com/130204/lifestyle-relationship/article/closets-are-clothes"">cover</a> of many local newspapers.</li>
<li>Though we have participated in Sao Paulo’s Pride parade in previous years, this year, Google was proud to be the first corporate sponsor thanks to the hard work of the Sao Paulo Gayglers. More than 100 Googlers marched—doubling participation from last year.</li>
<li>Google participated for the first time in celebrations in Mexico City, Paris and Hamburg.</li>
<li>We kicked off a collaboration with two founding partners called '<a href=""http://nyitottakvagyunk.hu/en"">We Are Open</a>' in Hungary that joins together companies, organizations and communities that are committed to openness. More than 100 organizations signed up to make a stand for diversity and we'll show our united front at Budapest Pride on Saturday, July 6.</li>

<br />
Our LGBT efforts are not just once a year during Pride, either. Earlier this year, we worked with Creative Lab to create a grassroots employee video for TheFour.com, an organization supporting marriage equality in the four U.S. states where it was on the ballot this past year. Google also co-wrote an article to the United States Supreme Court explaining why Gay Marriage is Good for Business. We supported the citizens of France by hosting marriage ceremonies over Hangouts and we recently launched a YouTube Spotlight Channel and campaign, #ProudtoLove, dedicated to celebrating LGBT Pride. <br />

<br />
This year, more than 8,500 Googlers from 75+ offices participated in 500 projects. Not only was this our largest GoogleServe to date, but it was also one of the more unique, as many projects were designed to expand the notion of what it means to give back to the community. Here’s a glimpse at some of what we were up to this year:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>In <b>Thimphu, Bhutan</b>, Googlers led a workshop about media literacy at the <a href=""http://bcmd.bt/"">Bhutan Centre for Media and Democracy</a> helping youth prepare to participate in shaping the future of this young democracy.</li>

<li>Googlers from our <b>Hyderabad, India</b> office volunteered at <a href=""http://www.srividhyaschool.com/"">Sri Vidhya's Centre for the Special Children</a>, helping children who suffer from a wide range of cognitive disabilities to learn how to identify colors, write their own names, and prepare meals for themselves.</li>
<li>A team of Googlers walked the <b>New York, N.Y.</b>, streets gathering information to improve <a href=""http://axslab.org/portfolio/axs-map-accessibility-metaverse/"">AXS Map</a>, a crowd-sourced platform for mapping wheelchair accessibility which is populated with data from Google Maps and Google Places APIs.</li>
<li>In <b>Lagos, Nigeria</b>, Googlers mentored entrepreneurs at <a href=""http://www.generationenterprise.org/"">Generation Enterprise</a>, a small business incubator that equips at-risk youth to start sustainable businesses in slum communities.</li>
<li>In <b>Randwick, Australia</b>, Googlers taught computer and Internet skills with the <a href=""http://www.redcross.org.au/young-parents-program.aspx"">Australian Red Cross Young Parents Program</a> which aims to develop the capacities of young parents to live independently and to parent successfully.</li>
<li>A group of gourmet Googlers cooked a meal for families with children undergoing cancer treatment with <a href=""http://www.ronaldmcdonaldhouse.org.uk/"">Ronald McDonald House</a> in <b>London, U.K.</b></li>
<li>Googlers tutored and mentored youth in <b>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</b>, with the <a href=""http://www.dignityforchildren.org/"">Dignity For Children Foundation</a>.</li>

Privacy and security are important topics—they matter to us, and they matter to you. Building on our Good to Know site with advice for safe and savvy Internet use, we hope this information helps you understand the choices and control that you have over your online information. </i> -Ed.<br />
<br />
More than a quarter of Internet users worldwide <a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120404006331/en/Strategy-Analytics-Quarter-Households-Worldwide-Wireless-Home"">use WiFi at home</a> to connect to the web, but many aren't sure how to protect their home network, or why it is important to do so. The best way to think of your home WiFi network is to think of it like your front door: you want a strong lock on both to ensure your safety and security. <br />
<br />
When data is in transit over an unsecured WiFi network, the information you’re sending or receiving could be intercepted by someone nearby. Your neighbors might also be able to use the network for their own Internet activities, which might slow down your connection. Securing your network can help keep your information safe when you’re connecting wirelessly, and can also help protect the devices that are connected to your network. <br />
<br />
If you’re interested in improving your home WiFi security, the steps below can help make your home network safer.<br />
<br />
<b>1. Check to see what kind of home WiFi security you already have. </b><br />
Do your friends need to enter a password to get on your network when they visit your house for the first time and ask to use your WiFi? If they don’t, your network isn’t as secure as it could be. Even if they do need to enter a password, there are a few different methods of securing your network, and some are better than others. Check what kind of security you have for your network at home by looking at your WiFi settings. Your network will likely either be unsecured, or secured with WEP, WPA or WPA2. WEP is the oldest wireless security protocol, and it’s pretty weak. WPA is better than WEP, but WPA2 is best. <br />
<br />
<b>2. Change your network security settings to WPA2.</b><br />
Your wireless router is the machine that creates the WiFi network. If you don’t have your home network secured with WPA2, you’ll need to access your router’s settings page to make the change. You can check your router’s user manual to figure out how to access this page, or look for instructions online for your specific router. Any device with a WiFi trademark sold since 2006 is required to support WPA2. If you have a router that was made before then, we suggest upgrading to a new router that does offer WPA2. It’s safer and can be much faster. <br />
<br />
<b>3. Create a strong password for your WiFi network.</b><br />
To secure your network with WPA2, you’ll need to create a password. It’s important that you <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/helping-passwords-better-protect-you.html"">choose a unique password</a>, with a long mix of numbers, letters and symbols so others can’t easily guess it. If you’re in a private space such as your home, it’s OK to write this password down so you can remember it, and keep it somewhere safe so you don’t lose it. You might also need it handy in case your friends come to visit and want to connect to the Internet via your network. Just like you wouldn’t give a stranger a key to your house, you should only give your WiFi password to people you trust. <br />
<br />
<b>4. Secure your router too, so nobody can change your settings.</b><br />
Your router needs its own password, separate from the password you use to secure your network. Routers come without a password, or if they do have one, it’s a simple default password that many online criminals may already know. If you don’t reset your router password, criminals anywhere in the world have an easy way to launch an attack on your network, the data shared on it and the computers connected to your network. For many routers, you can reset the password from the router settings page. Keep this password to yourself, and make it different from the one you use to connect to the WiFi network (as described in step 3). If you make these passwords the same, then anyone who has the password to connect to your network will also be able to change your wireless router settings.<br />
<br />
<b>5. If you need help, look up the instructions.</b><br />
If you’ve misplaced your router’s manual, type the model number of your base station or router into a search engine—in many cases the info is available online. Otherwise, contact the company that manufactured the router or your Internet Service Provider for assistance.<br />

This stunning global view is virtually cloud-free and includes refreshed imagery in more locations—giving you an even more accurate and comprehensive view of our planet's landscape. <br />

<i>The new, even more beautiful global view in Maps and Earth.</i></div>
<br />
Our satellite imagery is usually created like a quilt: we stitch together imagery of different parts of the world. Using a process similar to how we produced the <a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2013/06/building-visual-planetary-time-machine.html"">global time-lapse imagery</a> of the Earth, we took hundreds of terabytes of data from the USGS's and NASA’s Landsat 7 satellite—sometimes dozens of photos of a single spot in the world—and analyzed the photos to compute a clear view of every place, even in tropical regions that are always at least partly cloudy.<br />
<br />
The result is a single, beautiful 800,000 megapixel image of the world, which can be viewed in Earth and Maps when you're zoomed out to a global view. This global image is so big, if you wanted to print it at a standard resolution of 300 dots per inch you’d need a piece of paper the size of a city block! This image is then blended into our highest resolution imagery, giving a beautiful cloud-free global view and detailed images in the same seamless map.<br />

<br />
So in 2006 we started a <a href=""http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2012/06/safe-browsing-protecting-web-users-for.html"">Safe Browsing program</a> to find and flag suspect websites. This means that when you are surfing the web, we can now warn you when a site is unsafe. We're currently flagging up to 10,000 sites a day—and because we share this technology with other browsers there are about 1 billion users we can help keep safe.<br />
<br />
But we're always looking for new ways to protect users' security. So today we're launching a new section on our <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/"">Transparency Report</a> that will shed more light on the sources of malware and phishing attacks.  You can now learn how many people see Safe Browsing warnings each week, where malicious sites are hosted around the world, how quickly websites become reinfected after their owners clean malware from their sites, and other tidbits we’ve surfaced.<br />

Often they’re the first place we head to when visiting a new city or town in order to learn about the heritage of that country. Though only a lucky few have the chance to travel to see these treasures first-hand, the Internet is helping to bring access to culture even when you can’t visit in person. <br />
<br />
At the <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/#!home"">Google Cultural Institute</a>, we’ve been busy working with our <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collections"">partners</a> to add a range of new online exhibitions to our existing collection. With more than 6 million photos, videos and documents, the diversity and range of subject matter is large—a reflection of the fact that culture means different things to different people. What the exhibitions have in common is that they tell stories; objects are one thing but it’s the people and places they link to that make them fascinating. <br />
<br />
<a href=""http://www.britishmuseum.org/"">The British Museum</a> is the U.K.’s most popular visitor attraction and the 4th most visited museum in the world. It’s well known for housing one of the most spectacular archaeological discoveries ever made—the 1,400 year old Anglo-Saxon burial from Sutton Hoo, untouched until its discovery in 1939. Their online exhibition “<a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/sutton-hoo-anglo-saxon-ship-burial/gQOPNM9M"">Sutton Hoo: Anglo-Saxon ship burial</a>” explores the discovery of the ship, featuring videos of the excavation and photos of the <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/helmet-from-the-ship-burial-at-sutton-hoo/0gG-b5Gge93nFg?exhibitId=gQOPNM9M"">iconic helmet</a> and a solid gold <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/gold-belt-buckle-from-the-ship-burial-at-sutton-hoo/DgEfh-k8vq_fdA?exhibitId=gQOPNM9M"">belt buckle</a>.

From archaeology we take you to sport, which is integral to the culture of many nations, including Brazil. In the lead-up to Brazil's hosting of the 2014 World Cup, the <a href=""http://www.museudofutebol.org.br/"">Museu do Futebol</a> has told the story of how the “beautiful game” came to Brazil. The photos, videos and posters in “<a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/the-game-and-the-people/QRJnLPBE"">The Game and the People</a>” track the social impact of the sport and its transition from a past time for the wealthy (with their pleated pants and satin belts) to the modern game.<br />
<br />
Science remains a perennially fascinating topic and the <a href=""http://www.museogalileo.it/"">Museo Galileo</a> in Italy has put together a series of three exhibitions looking at the link between art and science. <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/the-medici-collections/wQlvvMRV"">The Medici Collections</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/the-lorraine-collections/wQltNadd"">the Lorraine Collections</a> and the <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/museo-galileo-library-collections/wQkJUK5c"">Library Collections</a> examine the beginnings of science and technology 500 years ago and chart developments from the discovery of the sun dial to the Google Maps of today. As well as being informative, the exhibitions include beautiful objects such as the <a href=""http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/jovilabe/cQFgp80XGw7Ikg?exhibitId=wQlvvMRV"">Jovilabe</a>, which was used to calculate the periods of Jupiter’s moons.<br />

The imagery was collected over three days using the <a href=""http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/learn/cars-trikes-and-more.html#trekker"">Street View Trekker and Trolley</a>, capturing high-resolution 360-degree panoramic imagery of several indoor and outdoor locations of the building.<br />
<br />
In addition to the breathtaking views from the world’s tallest observation deck on the 124th floor, you can also see what it feels like to hang off one of the building’s maintenance units on the 80th floor, normally used for cleaning windows!<br />

983582424091537872,,Google Blogs,2013-06-21T01:00:00-07:00,"“You’ve come a long way, Baby”: remembering the world’s first stored program computer","Sixty-five years ago today, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Small-Scale_Experimental_Machine"">Manchester Small Scale Experimental Machine</a>—nicknamed “Baby”—became the earliest computer in the world to run a program electronically stored in its memory. This was a flagship moment: the first implementation of the <a href=""http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/567553/stored-program-concept"">stored program concept</a> that underpins modern computing.  <br />
<br />
Earlier computers had their instructions hardwired into their physical design or held externally on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_tape"">punched paper tape</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_cards"">cards</a>.  Reprogramming them to do a different task entailed internal rewiring or altering the physical storage media.  The Baby marked a new computing era, described by some as the “<a href=""http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/birth-of-the-computer/4/87"">birth of software</a>,” in which swapping programs was far simpler—requiring only an update to the electronic memory.  Both instructions and data were held in the Baby’s memory and the contents could be altered automatically at electronic speeds during the course of computation.  <br />
<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/cozcXiSSkwE"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
<br />
Developed at Manchester University by <a href=""http://www.computer50.org/mark1/williams.html"">“Freddie” Williams</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kilburn"">Tom Kilburn</a> and <a href=""http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/baby-changed-the-world-957962"">Geoff Tootill</a>, in size the Baby was anything but: <a href=""http://www.mosi.org.uk/media/34352414/the%20baby,%20the%20world's%20first%20stored-program%20computer.pdf"">more than 5m long and weighing a tonne</a>&nbsp;(PDF). Its moniker was due to its role as a testbed for the experimental <a href=""http://www.computer50.org/kgill/williams/williams.html"">Williams-Kilburn tube</a>, a means of storing binary digits (“bits”) using a cathode ray tube. This was a big deal because up until this point, computers had no cost-effective means of storing and flexibly accessing information in electronic form.  <br />
<br />
In technical terms, the Williams-Kilburn tube was the earliest form of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"">random access memory</a>, or RAM.  The Baby’s memory consisted of one of these tubes, able to store up to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_tube"">1,024 bits</a>—equivalent to just 128 bytes.  In contrast, the average computer today has RAM in multiples of gigabytes, more than a billion times bigger.   <br />
<br />
The Baby was only ever intended to be a proof-of-concept rather than to serve as a useful calculation tool.  So once it had shown the new memory was reliable, attention shifted to building a more powerful and practical machine using the same concepts.  This resulted in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Mark_1"">Manchester Mark 1</a>, which in turn was the model for the Ferranti Mark 1, the world’s <a href=""http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/sale.html"">first computer to be sold commercially</a>, in February 1951. <br />
<br />
While today nothing remains of the original Baby, a <a href=""http://www.mosi.org.uk/whats-on/meet-baby.aspx"">working replica is on display</a> at the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) in Manchester. It’s well worth a visit to reflect on just how far computing has come.  <br />

With free online tools, a passion for math and an initial investment of just $10 to register his domain, <a href=""http://www.hoodamath.com/"">www.hoodamath.com</a> was born. Eventually Michael’s website became popular with more than just his students. So Michael gave <a href=""http://www.google.com/adsense/start/"">Google AdSense</a> a try as a way to earn money by placing ads next to his content. As word spread and traffic grew, the revenue generated from his site allowed Michael to devote himself full time to Hooda Math. Today, www.hoodamath.com has more than 350 educational games and has had more than 100 million unique visitors to the site. Beyond building a business for himself, Michael is helping students everywhere learn math while having fun. <br />

Ninety-seven percent of American Internet users look online for local products and services. Whether we’re on our smartphones, tablets or computers, the web helps us find what we’re looking for.<br />
<br />
Here at Google, we see firsthand how the web is helping American businesses grow and thrive. Through our search and advertising programs, businesses like Casa Kids find customers, publishers like Hooda Math earn money from their content, and nonprofits solicit donations and volunteers. These tools are how we make money, and they’re how millions of other U.S. businesses do, too.  <br />
<br />
In 2012, Google's search and advertising tools helped provide <a href=""http://google.com/economicimpact"">$94 billion of economic activity for more than 1.9 million American businesses</a>—advertisers, publishers and nonprofits. This represents a 17 percent increase from 2011.

1525567116229664339,,Google Blogs,2013-06-15T22:48:00-07:00,Our continued commitment to combating child exploitation online,"The Internet has been a tremendous force for good—increasing access to information, improving people’s ability to communicate and driving economic growth. But like the physical world, there are dark corners on the web where criminal behavior exists.<br />
<br />
In 2011, the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children’s (NCMEC’s) <a href=""http://www.missingkids.com/cybertipline/"">Cybertipline</a> Child Victim Identification Program reviewed 17.3 million images and videos of suspected child sexual abuse. This is four times more than what their Exploited Children's Division (ECD) saw in 2007. And the number is still growing. Behind these images are real, vulnerable kids who are sexually victimized and victimized further through the distribution of their images.  <br />
<br />
It is critical that we take action as a community—as concerned parents, guardians, teachers and companies—to help combat this problem.<br />
<br />
Child sexual exploitation is a global problem that needs a global solution. More than half of the images and videos sent to NCMEC for analysis are found to have been uploaded to U.S. servers from outside the country. With this in mind, we need to sustain and encourage borderless communication between organizations fighting this problem on the ground. For example, NCMEC’s CyberTipline is able to refer reports regarding online child sexual exploitation to 66 countries, helping local law enforcement agencies effectively execute their investigations. <br />
<br />
Google has been working on fighting child exploitation since as early as 2006 when we joined the <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/coalition-against-child-pornography.html"">Technology Coalition</a>, teaming up with other tech industry companies to develop technical solutions.  Since then, we’ve been providing software and hardware to helping organizations all around the world to fight child abuse images on the web and help locate missing children.  <br />
<br />
There is much more that can be done, and Google is taking our commitment another step further through a $5 million effort to eradicate child abuse imagery online.  Part of this commitment will go to global child protection partners like the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children and the Internet Watch Foundation.  We’re providing additional support to similar heroic organizations in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia and Latin America.  <br />
<br />
Since 2008, we’ve used “hashing” technology to tag known child sexual abuse images, allowing us to identify duplicate images which may exist elsewhere. Each offending image in effect gets a unique ID that our computers can recognize without humans having to view them again. Recently, we’ve started working to incorporate encrypted “fingerprints” of child sexual abuse images into a cross-industry database.  This will enable companies, law enforcement and charities to better collaborate on detecting and removing these images, and to take action against the criminals. Today we’ve also announced a $2 million Child Protection Technology Fund to encourage the development of ever more effective tools. <br />
<br />
We’re in the business of making information widely available, but there’s certain “information” that should never be created or found. We can do a lot to ensure it’s not available online—and that when people try to share this disgusting content they are caught and prosecuted.  <br />

8808737415648973312,,Google Blogs,2013-06-14T20:16:00-07:00,Introducing Project Loon: Balloon-powered Internet access,"The Internet is one of the most transformative technologies of our lifetimes.  But for 2 out of every 3 people on earth, a fast, affordable Internet connection is still out of reach.  And this is far from being a solved problem. <br />
<p>There are many terrestrial challenges to Internet connectivity—jungles, archipelagos, mountains. There are also major cost challenges. Right now, for example, in most of the countries in the southern hemisphere, the cost of an Internet connection is more than a month’s income. <br />
<p>Solving these problems isn’t simply a question of time: it requires looking at the problem of access from new angles. So today we’re unveiling our latest <a href=""https://www.solveforx.com/about/whatisamoonshot/"">moonshot</a> from Google[x]: balloon-powered Internet access.  <br />
<p><iframe width=""650"" height=""366"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/m96tYpEk1Ao"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<p>We believe that it might actually be possible to build a ring of balloons, flying around the globe on the stratospheric winds, that provides Internet access to the earth below.  It’s very early days, but we’ve built a system that uses balloons, carried by the wind at altitudes twice as high as commercial planes, to beam Internet access to the ground at speeds similar to today’s 3G networks or faster. As a result, we hope balloons could become an option for connecting rural, remote, and underserved areas, and for helping with communications after natural disasters.  The idea may sound a bit crazy—and that’s part of the reason we’re calling it <a href=""http://www.google.com/loon"">Project Loon</a>—but there’s solid science behind it.<br />
<p><iframe width=""650"" height=""366"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/mcw6j-QWGMo"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<p>Balloons, with all their effortless elegance, present some challenges. Many projects have looked at high-altitude platforms to provide Internet access to fixed areas on the ground, but trying to stay in one place like this requires a system with major cost and complexity.  So the idea we pursued was based on freeing the balloons and letting them sail freely on the winds.  All we had to do was figure out how to control their path through the sky. We’ve now found a way to do that, using just wind and solar power: we can move the balloons up or down to catch the winds we want them to travel in. That solution then led us to a new problem: how to manage a fleet of balloons sailing around the world so that each balloon is in the area you want it right when you need it. We’re solving this with some complex algorithms and lots of computing power. <br />
<p>Now we need some help—this experiment is going to take way more than our team alone.  This week we started a pilot program in the <a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Canterbury,+New+Zealand&hl=en&ll=-43.735383,171.702576&spn=1.232403,2.897644&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=43.037246,92.724609&oq=canterbury+n&hnear=Canterbury,+New+Zealand&t=m&z=9"">Canterbury area of New Zealand</a> with 50 testers trying to connect to our balloons.  This is the first time we’ve launched this many balloons (30 this week, in fact) and tried to connect to this many receivers on the ground, and we’re going to learn a lot that will help us improve our technology and balloon design.  <br />
<p><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-11QvZgzOsnc/UbuwCEWYa2I/AAAAAAAAMj0/_HZ1d4IW8jM/s1600/Loon-mission-control.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-11QvZgzOsnc/UbuwCEWYa2I/AAAAAAAAMj0/_HZ1d4IW8jM/s640/Loon-mission-control.png"" /></a></div><p>Over time, we’d like to set up pilots in countries at the same latitude as New Zealand.  We also want to find partners for the next phase of our project—we can’t wait to hear feedback and ideas from people who’ve been working for far longer than we have on this enormous problem of providing Internet access to rural and remote areas.  We imagine someday you'll be able to use your cell phone with your existing service provider to connect to the balloons and get connectivity where there is none today.<br />

To win Cube Slam, hit the cube against your friend’s screen three times until the screen explodes. Shields, obstacles, and gravity fields change with every new level, and you can unlock power-ups including fireballs, lasers, multi-balls, mirrored controls, bulletproof shields, fog, ghost balls, time bombs, resized paddles, extra lives and death balls––though you might want to avoid the death balls. If none of your friends are online, you can always play against Bob the Bear and see what level you can reach. If you install the <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cube-slam/pkcoeeddamedegogbcmdbadnoifmfipn"">Cube Slam app</a>, you can even play Bob when you’re offline.<br />

But one of humanity’s most iconic forms of communication—the kiss—has been left out in the cold. Now, though, you can send a kiss to anyone, anywhere in the world, through <a href=""http://kisses.burberry.com/"">Burberry Kisses</a>, a new campaign from Burberry and Google. And not just any kiss, but <i>your</i> kiss.<br />
<br />
To get started, simply visit <a href=""http://kisses.burberry.com/"">kisses.burberry.com</a> and pucker up in front of your webcam (this works best on Chrome). Using unique kiss-detection technology, the site will detect the outline of your actual lips, which you can choose to dress up with a Burberry lipstick color. If you’re using your touch screen mobile or tablet, you can <i>actually</i> kiss your screen (you might want to wipe it off first) and your lip outline will be taken from there. After that, write a short message and send it to someone from your Google+ friends list or via email. Then sit back and see the envelope with your message fly from your city to the receiver’s destination across a 3D landscape. The receiver gets an email, from which they can see the same journey, read your message and hopefully respond with a kiss of their own. <br />
<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/LRiZMVEIhas"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
<br />
For an example, see <a href=""http://kisses.burberry.com/kiss/zM67ZgAC"">this message I sent to my mom this morning</a>. All the kisses being sent around the world can be seen in a real-time interactive map, capturing the story of the world’s love.

Read the full text below. </i>-Ed.<br />
<br />
Dear Attorney General Holder and Director Mueller<br />
<br />
Google has worked tremendously hard over the past fifteen years to earn our users’ trust.  For example, we offer encryption across our services; we have hired some of the best security engineers in the world; and we have consistently pushed back on overly broad government requests for our users’ data.  <br />
<br />
We have always made clear that we comply with valid legal requests.  And last week, the Director of National Intelligence acknowledged that service providers have received Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests.  <br />
<br />
Assertions in the press that our compliance with these requests gives the U.S. government unfettered access to our users’ data are simply untrue.  However, government nondisclosure obligations regarding the number of FISA national security requests that Google receives, as well as the number of accounts covered by those requests, fuel that speculation.<br />
<br />
We therefore ask you to help make it possible for Google to publish in our <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/US/"">Transparency Report</a> aggregate numbers of national security requests, including FISA disclosures—in terms of both the number we receive and their scope.  Google’s numbers would clearly show that our compliance with these requests falls far short of the claims being made.  Google has nothing to hide. <br />
<br />
Google appreciates that you authorized the <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/transparency-report-shedding-more-light.html"">recent disclosure</a> of general numbers for national security letters. There have been no adverse consequences arising from their publication, and in fact more companies are receiving your approval to do so as a result of Google’s initiative.  Transparency here will likewise serve the public interest without harming national security.<br />
<br />
We will be making this letter public and await your response. <br />

5698648908326299537,,Google Blogs,2013-06-11T09:00:00-07:00,How green is the Internet?,"More than ever, people are using the Internet to shop, read, listen to music and learn. And businesses rely on Internet-based tools to operate and deliver their services efficiently. The Internet has created all kinds of new opportunities for society and the economy—but what does it mean for the environment? <br />
<br />
We’ve been <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/efficiency/industry-collaboration/"">working to answer</a> that question and enlisted the help of <a href=""http://www.lbl.gov/"">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> (Berkeley Lab) to gather more data. <a href=""http://crd.lbl.gov/assets/pubs_presos/ACS/cloud_efficiency_study.pdf"">Their study</a>&nbsp;(PDF),&nbsp;released today, shows that migrating all U.S. office workers to the cloud could save up to 87 percent of IT energy use—about 23 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, or enough to power the city of Los Angeles for a year. The savings are associated with shifting people in the workforce to Internet-based applications like email, word processing and customer relationship software.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jcu_EzXdK2k/UbcvpAG4zfI/AAAAAAAAMhE/d0LfHb88gAQ/s1600/movingtocloud.jpeg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""300"" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jcu_EzXdK2k/UbcvpAG4zfI/AAAAAAAAMhE/d0LfHb88gAQ/s400/movingtocloud.jpeg"" width=""400"" /></a></div>
<br />
These results indicate that the Internet offers huge potential for energy savings. We’re especially excited that Berkeley Lab has made its <a href=""http://cleermodel.lbl.gov/"">model</a> publicly available so other researchers and experts can plug in their own assumptions and help refine and improve the results.  <br />
<br />
Of course, understanding the impact of shifting office applications to the cloud is only part of the story, which is why last week we hosted a summit called “How Green is the Internet?” to explore these questions in greater detail. At the summit, experts presented data on how the growth of Internet infrastructure, including devices like phones and tablets, can impact the environment.  We also saw great excitement about the potential for entirely new Internet-enabled tools in areas like transportation, e-commerce and digital content to deliver huge energy and carbon savings. We’ve <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/efficiency/industry-collaboration/"">posted the videos</a> from those sessions and invite you to take a look.  <br />
<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/wpZ4OgWgit8"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
<br />
One of our goals in hosting the summit and supporting the Berkeley Lab study was to identify and encourage new research on this topic. We’ll continue to work to answer some of these questions, and we hope others will too.<br />

Today, in honour of the 84th birthday of Professor <a href=""http://cs.anu.edu.au/publications/eljc/Volume_8/v8i2i1.html"">Aviezri Fraenkel</a>, we’re delighted to share a short film sharing his story of working on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEIZAC"">the WEIZAC</a>, Israel’s first computer.    <br />
<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/I9QVx_fc4OY"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
<i>Short film produced with support from Google as part of our <a href=""http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.com/search/label/Computing%20Heritage"">ongoing computing heritage series</a></i><br />
<br />
The impetus to build a computer in Israel came from Professor <a href=""http://www.nap.edu/readingroom.php?book=biomems&amp;page=cpekeris.html"">Chaim Pekeris</a>, an MIT-trained geophysicist and mathematician, who made it a condition of accepting a job at the <a href=""http://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/history#.UadncSt4ZWY"">then-fledgling Weizmann Institute</a>.   An illustrious committee was set up to consider Pekeris’s request and initially opinion was divided.  In particular, <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=hGOnMJ2gc-8C&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=einstein+against+weizac&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=82KyUae0KMrJrgHgqoH4CQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=einstein%20against%20weizac&amp;f=false"">Albert Einstein was skeptical</a> a computer in Israel would receive sufficient use and queried whether the skilled resources to build it were available.  It took much convincing by another committee member, mathematician and computing luminary <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann#Computer_science"">John Von Neumann</a>, before the project got the go-ahead.  <br />
<br />
Construction of the WEIZAC (“Weizmann Automatic Calculator”) got underway in late 1953 under the leadership of Professor Pekeris and <a href=""http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/obituary-gerald-estrin-90-ucla-231609.aspx"">Jerry Estrin</a>.  A protege of Von Neumann, Estrin arrived in Israel armed with <a href=""http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/birth-of-the-computer/4/92"">design drawings based on the computer at the Institute of Advanced Study</a> in Princeton.  After advertising for recruits, a small team of engineers and technicians was assembled, among them Aviezri Fraenkel.  <br />
<br />
It took the team a lot of <a href=""http://www.jta.org/2004/11/17/life-religion/features/remembering-israels-first-computer"">ingenuity to source the necessary materials</a>.  Some were imported, but others were clever adaptations, such as the thin copper strips that came from a small local bicycle-part shop!  Despite such hurdles, <a href=""http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki6/index.php/Milestones:WEIZAC_Computer,_1955"">progress was steady</a>, and the major components were in place by the time Estrin returned to the U.S. 15 months later.   <br />
<br />
The WEIZAC <a href=""http://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/first-computer#.UadSVCt4ZWZ"">performed its first calculation in October 1955</a> and was soon much in demand by Israeli scientists.  It remained operational until the end of 1963—50 years ago this year.  Nowadays it resides in the Weizmann Institute’s Ziskind Building as a fitting memorial to where computing in Israel began.  <br />
<br />
I have fond memories of passing by the WEIZAC every day when I studied at the Weizmann Institute, where I also had the privilege to attend a class by Professor Fraenkel.  With the release of this short film, I’m delighted to be learning more from him about such an important chapter in Israel’s tech history.<br />

7285947658672226111,,Google Blogs,2013-06-07T12:50:00-07:00,What the ...?,"Dear Google users—<br />
<br />
You may be aware of press reports alleging that Internet companies have joined a secret U.S. government program called PRISM to give the National Security Agency direct access to our servers.  As Google’s CEO and Chief Legal Officer, we wanted you to have the facts.<br />
<br />
First, we have not joined any program that would give the U.S. government—or any other government—direct access to our servers.  Indeed, the U.S. government does not have direct access or a “back door” to the information stored in our data centers.  We had not heard of a program called PRISM until yesterday.<br />
<br />
Second, we provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law.  Our legal team reviews each and every request, and frequently pushes back when requests are overly broad or don’t follow the correct process.   Press reports that suggest that Google is providing open-ended access to our users’ data are false, period.  Until this week’s reports, we had never heard of the broad type of order that Verizon received—an order that appears to have required them to hand over millions of users’ call records.  We were very surprised to learn that such broad orders exist.  Any suggestion that Google is disclosing information about our users’ Internet activity on such a scale is completely false. <br />
<br />
Finally, this episode confirms what we have long believed—there needs to be a more transparent approach.  Google has worked hard, within the confines of the current laws, to be open about the data requests we receive.  We post this information on our <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/US/"">Transparency Report</a> whenever possible.  We were the first company to do this.  And, of course, we understand that the U.S. and other governments need to take action to protect their citizens’ safety—including sometimes by using surveillance.  But the level of secrecy around the current legal procedures undermines the freedoms we all cherish.<br />

<br />
Eight years ago, I loaded five boxes into my pickup truck, said goodbye to a career of crunching numbers in hotel management, and started my own massage practice in Washington state.<br />
<br />
Soon thereafter, I started at Google as an <a href=""http://www.google.com/intl/en/jobs/students/lifeatgoogle/benefitsperks/"">onsite massage therapist</a> at the Kirkland and Seattle offices, and I was ready for the challenge. But after a few years of massage work, I started to ponder alternatives to massage to further help my fellow Googlers relax and de-stress. Being able to take a moment out of one’s day to relax and decompress is not only beneficial for one’s health, but also may help people be <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2225634/Is-worlds-happiest-man-Brain-scans-reveal-French-monk-abnormally-large-capacity-joy-meditation.html"">happier</a> and more <a href=""http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2012/10/if-youre-too-busy-to-meditate.html"">productive</a> in their day to day lives. So in 2011, I helped launch “MindBody Awareness,” a guided meditation class, as part of the Googler-to-Googler (g2g)  program. <br />
<br />
It’s no secret that meditation can be an excellent way to relax your body and focus the mind. A plethora of <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2008914,00.html"">studies</a> have supported that point. That said, one of the hardest parts of meditation is simply giving it a try. For an activity based in calmness and openness, it’s ironic how meditation can, for some, engender feelings of intimidation and even embarrassment at the outset. So we specifically designed “MindBody Awareness” for all levels so anyone can walk through the door and dive right in. Having a friendly, informal meditation class taught onsite by a fellow Googler allows for community building, and immediately relaxes participants whether they’re new to the practice or veterans. <br />

<i>Leading a MindBody Awareness class at our Kirkland, Wash. office </i></div>
<br />
We begin each 30-minute class by going through a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong"">Qigong</a> series that consists of 12 different positions held for 30 seconds each. This is how we begin bringing awareness of one’s body and mind into play, shedding the distractions from the outside and becoming more in tune with one’s self. The second portion of the class is a seated meditation, which incorporates changing hand positions, where chimes go off every minute to signal a change in pose. This integrates the mind and the body instead of just one or the other. The chimes help the mind stay focused, and acts as an anchor helping people return to a quiet mind if they happen to get lost in distraction. An engineer who takes my class told me “being aware of what my physical body needs while my brain is busy coding has helped me significantly reduce stress, not get so worn out, and enjoy my job.” Another Googler noted to me that he feels “having a regular chance to slow down, collect [himself] and connect mind and body contributes to a more mindful, lower stress outlook throughout the week.” <br />

To make it even easier for Googlers to access meditation classes, we offer global meditative Google Hangouts. Googlers can video conference into a meditation hangout for 30 or 60 minutes to practice meditation as a group.<br />

As of today, a lot. We’ve just inked agreements with <a href=""http://www.o2.se/in-english/the-organisation/"">O2</a> and <a href=""http://www.allianzcapitalpartners.com/en/"">Allianz</a> to supply our Finnish data center with renewable energy for the next 10 years—our fourth long-term agreement to power our data centers with renewable energy worldwide, and our first in Europe.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/gallery/#/places/12"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ddqoxLtoCNA/Ua0fZEKkHoI/AAAAAAAAMf0/vzQcQTXH804/s550/google-datacenter-places-13.jpg"" width=""550"" /></a></div><br />
Here’s how it works: O2, the wind farm developer, has obtained planning approval to build a new 72MW wind farm at <a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=204056802863659313222.0004de50fca46cc70d9ea&msa=0&ll=66.885355,23.273163&spn=0.156073,0.617294"">Maevaara</a>, in Övertorneå and Pajala municipality in northern Sweden, using highly efficient 3MW wind turbines.  We’ve committed to buying the entire output of that wind farm for 10 years so that we can power our Finnish data center with renewable energy.  That agreement has helped O2 to secure 100% financing for the construction of the wind farm from the investment arm of German insurance company Allianz, which will assume ownership when the wind farm becomes operational in early 2015.<br />
<br />
This arrangement is possible thanks to Scandinavia’s integrated electricity market and grid system, Nord Pool. It enables us to buy the wind farm’s output in Sweden with Guarantee of Origin certification and consume an equivalent amount of power at our data center in Finland. We then “retire” the Guarantee of Origin certificates to show that we’ve actually used the energy.<br />
<br />
<div style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i7OUrs99qqs/Ua0ddhD12dI/AAAAAAAAMfo/dgC6Lmh2AJk/s1600/1.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i7OUrs99qqs/Ua0ddhD12dI/AAAAAAAAMfo/dgC6Lmh2AJk/s550/1.jpg"" width=""550"" /></a></div><br />
As a carbon neutral company, our goal is to use as much renewable energy as possible—and by doing so, stimulate further production. The Maevaara wind farm not only allows us to make our already <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VChOEvKicQQ"">highly energy-efficient</a> Finnish data center even more sustainable, it also meets our goal of adding new renewable energy generation capacity to the grid.<br />
<br />
Of course, using renewable energy is good for the environment, but it also makes long term financial sense.  That’s why, in addition to protecting ourselves against future increases in power prices through long-term purchasing for our operations, we also invest in new renewable energy projects that will deliver a return for our money.  In recent years we’ve committed more than $1 billion to such projects in the <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/energy/investments/"">U.S.</a>, <a href=""http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.com/2011/04/google-to-invest-in-german-solar-power.html"">Germany</a> and, just last week, <a href=""http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.com/2013/05/investing-in-south-african-solar-energy.html"">South Africa</a>.

Starting today, we'll also be posting regularly with privacy and security tips. We hope this information helps you understand the choices and control that you have over your online information.</i> -Ed.<br />
<br />
It could be your Gmail, your photos or your documents—whatever you have in your Google Account, we work hard to make sure it’s protected from would-be identity thieves, other bad guys, or any illegitimate attempts to access your information. <br />
<br />
But you can also help keep your information safe. Think of how upset you would be if someone else got access to your Google Account without your permission, and then take five minutes to follow the steps below and help make it more secure. Let’s start with the key to unlocking your account—your password:<br />
<br />
<b>1.  Use a different password for each important service</b><br />
Make sure you have a different password for every important online account you have. Bad guys will steal your username and password from one site, and then use them to try to log into lots of other sites where you might have an account. Even large, reputable sites sometimes have their password databases stolen. If you use the same password across many different sites, there’s a greater chance it might end up on a list of stolen passwords. And the more accounts you have that use that password, the more data you might lose if that password is stolen. <br />
<br />
Giving an account its own, strong password helps protect you and your information in that account. Start today by making sure your Google Account has a unique password.<br />
<br />
<b>2. Make your password hard to guess </b><br />
“password.” “123456.” “My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!” These examples are terrible passwords because everyone knows them—including potential attackers. Making your passwords longer or more complicated makes them harder to guess for both bad guys and people who know you. We know it’s hard: the average password is shorter than 8 characters, and many just contain letters. In a database of 32 million real passwords that were made public in 2009, <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jcb82/doc/B12-IEEESP-analyzing_70M_anonymized_passwords.pdf"">analysis showed</a>&nbsp;(PDF) only 54 percent included numbers, and only 3.7 percent had special characters like &amp; or $.<br />
<br />
One way to build a strong password is to think of a phrase or sentence that other people wouldn’t know and then use that to build your password. For example, for your email you could think of a personal message like “I want to get better at responding to emails quickly and concisely” and then build your password from numbers, symbols, and the first letters of each word—“iw2gb@r2eq&amp;c”. Don’t use popular phrases or lyrics to build your password—<a href=""http://usablesecurity.com/?p=75"">research suggests</a> that people gravitate to the same phrases, and you want your password to be something only you know.<br />
<br />
Google doesn’t restrict password length, so go wild! <br />
<br />
<b>3. Keep your password somewhere safe</b><br />
<a href=""http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2006/proceedings/p44_gaw.pdf"">Research shows</a>&nbsp;(PDF) that worrying about remembering too many passwords is the chief reason people reuse certain passwords across multiple services. But don’t worry—if you’ve created so many passwords that it’s hard to remember them, it’s OK to make a list and write them down. Just make sure you keep your list in a safe place, where you won’t lose it and others won’t be able to find it. If you’d prefer to manage your passwords digitally, a trusted password manager might be a good option. <a href=""https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95606?hl=en"">Chrome</a> and many web browsers have free password managers built into them, and there are many independent options as well—take a few minutes to read through reviews and see what would be best for your needs. <br />
<b><br />
4. Set a recovery option</b><br />
Have you ever forgotten your password? Has one of your friends ever been locked out of their account? <a href=""http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=183723&amp;ctx=cbo&amp;cbid=423539972&amp;cbrank=2"">Setting a recovery option</a>, like an alternate email address or a telephone number, helps give the service provider another way to contact you if you are ever locked out of your account. Having an up-to-date recovery phone or email address is the best thing you can do to make sure you can get back into your account fast if there is ever a problem.<br />
<br />
If you haven’t set a recovery option for your Google Account, <a href=""https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/183723?hl=en"">add one now</a>. If you have, just take a second to make sure it’s up to date.<br />

We’ve made a <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/02/an-update-on-our-war-against-account.html"">huge amount of progress</a> to help protect your Google Account from people who want to break into it, but for the time being, creating a unique, strong password is still an important way to protect your online accounts.

We’ve just closed our first investment in Africa: $12 million USD (103 million Rand) investment in the Jasper Power Project, a 96 megawatt solar photovoltaic plant in the Northern Cape province of South Africa.  Upon completion, Jasper will be one of the largest solar installations on the continent, capable of generating enough electricity to power 30,000 South African homes.

<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>The Jasper Power Project is located in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa, near Postmasburg</i></div>
<br />
<br />
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
When we consider <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/energy/investments/"">investing in a renewable energy project</a>, we focus on two key factors. First, we only pursue investments that we believe make financial sense. South Africa’s strong resources and supportive policies for renewable energy make it an attractive place to invest—which is why it had the highest growth in clean energy investment in the world last year. Second, we look for projects that have transformative potential—that is, projects that will bolster the growth of the renewable energy industry and move the world closer to a clean energy future. The Jasper Power Project is one of those transformative opportunities. To explain why, perhaps some background would be helpful.</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
Back in 2008, South Africa experienced a severe energy shortage, which resulted in blackouts throughout the country and slowed down economic growth. Since then the South African government has been actively supporting the growth of new sources of electricity to power the nation. While today South Africa is primarily dependent on fossil fuels, there’s lots of potential for renewable energy—it’s a country blessed with abundant wind and solar resources—and the government has set an ambitious goal of generating 18 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy by 2030 (as a comparison, the entire South African grid is currently <a href=""http://www.reegle.info/countries/south-africa-energy-profile/ZA"">44 GW</a>).</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<br /></div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
To meet this goal, the South African government has established the <a href=""http://www.ipprenewables.co.za/"">Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program</a> (REIPPPP).  Through the program, renewable energy projects compete on the basis of cost and contribution to the local economy to be awarded a contract with Eskom, South Africa’s state-owned energy utility. Jasper and the other projects being developed through the REIPPPP have the potential to transform the South African energy grid.  And given South Africa’s position as an economic powerhouse in Africa, a greener grid in South Africa can set an example for the whole continent.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PXF8IuuaUuk/Uad3LB6lWKI/AAAAAAAAMb8/ggWyLFaJHYA/s1600/solarpanelsjasper.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""356"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PXF8IuuaUuk/Uad3LB6lWKI/AAAAAAAAMb8/ggWyLFaJHYA/s640/solarpanelsjasper.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>Once constructed, the project will use solar panels like these. </i></div>
<br />
Just as compelling are the economic and social benefits that the project will bring to the local community. Jasper will create approximately 300 construction and 50 permanent jobs in a region experiencing high rates of <a href=""http://www.statssa.gov.za/keyindicators/keyindicators.asp"">unemployment</a>, as well as providing rural development and education programs and setting aside a portion of total project revenues—amounting to approximately $26 million over the life of the project—for enterprise and socio-economic development. We appreciate how forward-thinking the South African government has been in designing the REIPPPP to encourage these kinds of local economic benefits.<br />
<br />
Google has committed more than $1 billion to renewable energy investments and we continue to search for new opportunities.  Our search has brought us from the U.S. to Europe and now to Africa. We’re excited to see where else it might lead.<br />

On the desktop, the new inbox groups your mail into categories which appear as different tabs. You simply choose which categories you want and voilà! Your inbox is organized in a way that lets you see what’s new at a glance and decide which emails you want to read when.<br />

<br />
You can easily customize the new inbox—select the tabs you want from all five to none, drag-and-drop to move messages between tabs, set certain senders to always appear in a particular tab and star messages so that they also appear in the Primary tab.<br />
<br />
In the <a href=""http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm"">Gmail for Android 4.0+</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-from-google/id422689480?mt=8"">Gmail for iPhone and iPad</a> apps, you'll see your Primary mail when you open the app and you can easily navigate to the other tabs.<br />

<br />
If the new inbox isn't quite your style, you can simply switch off all optional tabs to go back to classic view, or switch to any of your <a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/answer/186534?hl=en"">other favorite inbox types</a>. <br />
<br />
The new inbox is rolling out gradually. The desktop, Android and iOS versions will become available within the next few weeks. If you'd like to try out the new inbox on Desktop sooner, keep an eye on the gear menu and select <b>Configure inbox</b> when it appears in the Settings options.<br />

Explorers and scientists alike have long studied and marveled at these islands—made famous by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin"">Charles Darwin</a>. The Ecuadorean Government, local conservation groups and scientists are working to protect the Galapagos from threats posed by invasive species, climate change and other human impacts. <br />
<br />
It’s critical that we share images with the world of this place in order to continue to study and preserve the islands’ unique biodiversity. Today we’re honored to announce, in partnership with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin"">Charles Darwin Foundation</a> (CDF) and the <a href=""http://www.galapagospark.org/"">Galapagos National Parks Directorate</a> (GNPD), that we’ve collected panoramic imagery of the islands with the <a href=""http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/learn/cars-trikes-and-more.html"">Street View Trekker</a>. These stunning images will be available on Google Maps later this year so people around the world can experience this remote archipelago. <br />

<br />
Our 10-day adventure in the Galapagos was full of hiking, boating and diving around the islands (in hot and humid conditions) to capture 360-degree images of the unique wildlife and geological features of the islands with the Trekker. We captured imagery from 10 locations that were hand-selected by CDF and GNPD. We walked past giant tortoises and blue-footed boobies, navigated through steep trails and lava fields, and picked our way down the crater of an active volcano called <a href=""http://www.galapagospark.org/sitio.php?page=volcan_sierra_negra_chico"">Sierra Negra</a>.<br />

<br />
Life underwater in the Galapagos is just as diverse as life on land. We knew our map of the islands wouldn’t be comprehensive without exploring the ocean that surrounds them. So for the <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/09/dive-into-great-barrier-reef-with-first_25.html"">second time</a> we teamed up with the folks at the <a href=""http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/"">Catlin Seaview Survey</a> to collect underwater panoramic imagery of areas being studied by CDF and GNPD. This imagery will be used by Catlin Seaview Survey to create a visual and scientific baseline record of the marine environment surrounding the islands, allowing for any future changes to be measured and evaluated by scientists around the world. <br />

We truly believe that in order to protect these Galapagos Islands, we must understand them. As they say, “a picture is worth a thousand words.” We hope this Street View imagery not only advances the important scientific research, but also inspires you to learn more about this special place. Stay tuned for updates on this collection—the first time we’ve captured imagery from both land and sea! We can’t wait to share this amazing imagery with you later this year. <br />

3200723104860411796,,Google Blogs,2013-05-22T09:32:00-07:00,“Coming Home” by Wisconsin student wins U.S. 2013 Doodle 4 Google competition,"After 130,000 submissions and millions of votes cast, Sabrina Brady of Sparta, Wisc. has been named the 2013 U.S. <a href=""http://www.google.com/doodle4google"">Doodle 4 Google</a> National Winner. Her doodle, “Coming Home,” will be featured on the Google homepage in the U.S. tomorrow, May 23.<br />
<br />
Students across all 50 states amazed us with their creative interpretations of this year’s theme, “My Best Day Ever...” From scuba diving to dinosaurs to exploring outer space, we were wowed by the ways young artists brought their best days to life in their doodles. <br />
<br />
Sabrina’s doodle stood out in the crowd; it tells the story of her reunion with her father as he returned from an 18 month deployment in Iraq. Her creative use of the Google letters to illustrate this heartfelt moment clearly resonated with voters across the country and all of us at Google. <br />
<br />
In addition to seeing her artwork on the Google homepage, Sabrina—who is in 12th grade at Sparta High School—will receive a $30,000 college scholarship, a Chromebook computer and a $50,000 technology grant for her school. She will attend Minneapolis College of Art and Design this coming fall, where she will continue her artistic pursuits. Congratulations Sabrina!<br />
<br />

<br />
In addition to the National Winner, voters across the country helped us determine the four National Finalists, who will each receive a $5,000 college scholarship:<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Grades K-3:</b> Reagan Gonsalves (Grade 1, Santan Elementary School, Chandler, Ariz.) for her doodle “My best day ever is learning about nature.” Reagan says, “My best day ever is to be around the pretty animals and plants in nature, because I love to know about what is around me. I love to watch hummingbirds drink nectar out of flowers. I love to read books on nature and how plants and animals grow.”</li>
<li><b>Grades 4-5:</b> Audrey Zhang (Grade 4, Michael F. Stokes Elementary School, Levittown, N.Y.) for her doodle “...When I discover paradise!” Zhang says, “My best day ever will be when I discover paradise. In paradise, I could play with dragons, romp with leopards, and chat with fairies...It would be the best day ever when I could finally live in a mystical, dreamy realm.”</li>
<li><b>Grades 6-7: </b>Maria Iannone (Grade 7, Chestnut Ridge Middle School, Sewell, N.J.) for her doodle “The best day ever.” Maria says, “Where I live, it's difficult to view the night sky very well. Having an interest in astronomy, a day where I can observe the things I study on my own time would satisfy me.”</li>
<li><b>Grades 8-9: </b>Joseph Han (Grade 8, Falmouth Middle School, Falmouth, Maine) for his doodle “Late-afternoon bliss.” Joey says, “For me, ‘the best day ever’ doesn't consist of ambitious dreams, but rather the enjoyment of a day spent in carefree euphoria. Being in the woods is something that evokes such happiness in me. The lighthearted joy of rafting, fishing or catching fireflies is what I've attempted to capture.”</li>
</ul>
<br />
After the awards ceremony, all 50 of our State Winners will unveil a special exhibition of their artwork at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where their doodles will be displayed for the public to view from May 22 - July 14.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all who voted and helped us select the 2013 Doodle 4 Google winners. Even more importantly, thank you to all of the students who submitted their artwork and the parents and teachers who continue to inspire and support their young artists. Until next year... happy doodling!<br />

With Google Trends, you can see what's hot right now, and also explore the history and geography of a topic as it evolves. Today you'll find <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/topcharts"">new charts</a> of the most-searched people, places and things in more than 40 categories, from movies to sports teams to tourist attractions. You'll also find a new colorful visualization of real-time Hot Searches. <br />
<br />
<b>Top Charts—a new monthly ""spirit of the times"" </b><br />
Top Charts are lists of real-world people, places and things ranked by search interest. They show information similar to our <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/topcharts"">Year-End Zeitgeist</a>, but updated monthly and going back to 2004. To check them out, go to Google Trends and click ""Top Charts"" on the left-hand side. For example, you can see the 10 most-searched cities, movies and scientists in April:<br />

<i>Top Charts includes more than 40 top 10 lists and more than 140 time periods. Hover on a chart for links to embed the chart in your own page or share on social media.</i></div>
<br />
Top Charts is built on the <a href=""http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html"">Knowledge Graph</a>, so the data shows interest in real-world <i>things</i>, not just keywords. When you look at a chart of sports teams and you see the Golden State Warriors, those rankings are based on many different related searches, like [gs warriors], [golden state bball] and [warriors basketball]. That way you see which topics are most popular on Google Search, however people search for them. Top Charts provide our most accurate search volume rankings, but no algorithm is perfect, so on rare occasion you may find anomalies in the data. You can learn more about Top Charts in our <a href=""https://support.google.com/trends/answer/3076011"">Help Center</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Hot Searches, now in hot colors</b><br />
In addition to Top Charts, now there's a vibrant new way to <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends/visualize"">visualize trending searches</a> as they happen. On the Trends homepage in the left-hand panel, you'll find a new link to ""Visualize Hot Searches in full-screen."" You’ll see the latest trending topics appear in a colorful display:<br />

<br />

<b>Zoom in to “gigapixel” paintings</b><br />
Gigapixel paintings—very high-resolution works which enable you to zoom in at brushstroke level—have long been at the heart of the Art Project. They’re a great example of the magic that can happen when technology meets art—and today we have 16 new ones to add, ranging from famous pieces like “<a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/the-munch-museum-oslo/artwork/the-scream-edvard-munch/809080/"">The Scream</a>” by Edvard Munch to those chosen by public vote such as “<a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/statens-museum-for-kunst/artwork/whitewashing-the-old-house-la-ring/37434033/"">Whitewashing the Old House</a>” by L.A. Ring. <br />
<br />
The beauty of gigapixels is their ability to surprise. Look at the painting “<a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/nasjonalmuseet-for-kunst/artwork/view-from-stalheim-johan-christian-dahl/28070347/"">Fra Stalheim</a>” by Johan Christian Dahl, shown in full on the left below. You’ll see a beautiful landscape. Zoom in, however, and you discover scenes within a scene—a village with smoking chimneys, a woman tending to her child, and cows grazing on the hillside. Details that can’t always be fully appreciated by the naked eye are brought to life online.<br />

<b>Immerse yourself in Street View</b><br />
Through Street View and the Google Art Project, many museums have opened their galleries to the world the past few years, and today we’re launching 20 more. For example, <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/fondation-beyeler/"">Fondation Beyeler</a> Museum in Switzerland houses a collection of seven Mark Rothko paintings. Now anyone in the world can virtually explore the collection. <br />
<br />

<br />
Of course art collections are not exclusively found in museums—we’re delighted to have our first monastery on Street View in the Art Project. The <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/patmos-monastery/museumview/"">Monastery of St. John the Theologian</a> on the Greek island of Patmos was founded in 1088 and is a World Heritage Site. In addition to their 116 contributed artworks, you can also explore the architectural splendors of this ancient building.<br />

7895638972703453885,,Google Blogs,2013-05-15T11:48:00-07:00,"Live from Google I/O: Mo’ screens, mo’ goodness","This morning, we kicked off the 6th annual <a href=""http://developers.google.com/io"">Google I/O</a> developer conference with over 6,000 developers at Moscone Center in San Francisco, 460 <a href=""https://developers.google.com/events/io/io-extended"">I/O Extended sites</a> in 90 countries, and millions of you around the world who tuned in via our <a href=""http://developers.google.com/io"">livestream</a>. Over the next three days, we’ll be hosting technical sessions, hands-on code labs, and demonstrations of Google's products and partners' technology.<br />
<br />
We believe computing is going through one of the most exciting moments in its history: people are increasingly adopting phones, tablets and newer type of devices. And this spread of technology has the potential to make a positive impact in the lives of people around the world—whether it's simply helping you in your daily commute, or connecting you to information that was previously inaccessible.<br />
<br />
This is why we focus so much on our two open platforms: Android and Chrome. They enable developers to innovate and reach as many people as possible with their apps and services across multiple devices. Android started as a simple idea to advance open standards on mobile; today it is the world’s leading mobile platform and growing rapidly. Similarly, Chrome launched less than five years ago from an open source project; today it’s the world’s most popular browser. <br />
<br />
In line with that vision, we made several announcements today designed to give developers even more tools to build great apps on Android and Chrome. We also shared new innovations from across Google meant to help make life just a little easier for you, including improvements in search, communications, photos, and maps. <br />
<br />
Here’s a quick look at some of the announcements we made at I/O:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><b><a href=""http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2013/05/androidio-just-press-play.html"">Android &amp; Google Play</a>:</b> In addition to new developer tools, we unveiled Google Play Music All Access, a monthly music subscription service with access to millions of songs that joins our music store and locker; and the Google Play game services with real-time multiplayer and leaderboards. Also, coming next month to Google Play is a special Samsung Galaxy S4, which brings together cutting edge hardware from Samsung with Google’s latest software and services—including the user experience that ships with our popular Nexus devices.</li>
<li><b><a href=""https://plus.google.com/+chrome"">Chrome</a>:</b> With over 750 million active users on Chrome, we’re now focused on bringing to mobile the speed, simplicity and security improvements that we’ve seen on the desktop. To that end, today we previewed next-generation video codec <a href=""http://blog.webmproject.org/2013/05/vp9-codec-nears-completion.html"">VP9</a> for faster video-streaming performance; the <a href=""http://www.chromium.org/developers/using-requestautocomplete"">requestAutocomplete API</a> for faster payments; and Chrome Experiments such as ""<a href=""http://www.thehobbit.com/middle-earth"">A Journey Through Middle Earth</a>"" and <a href=""http://g.co/racer"">Racer</a> to demonstrate the ability to create immersive mobile experiences not possible in years past.</li>
<li><b><a href=""http://googleplusproject.blogspot.com/2013/05/new-google-stream-hangouts-and-photos.html"">Google+</a>: </b>We unveiled the newly designed Google+, which helps you easily explore content as well dramatically improve your online photo experience to give you crisp, beautiful photos—without the work! We also upgraded Google+ Hangouts—our popular group video application—to help bring all of your real-life conversations online, across any device or platform, and with groups of up to 10 friends.</li>
<li><b><a href=""http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-multi-screen-and-conversational.html"">Search</a>:</b> Search has evolved considerably in recent years: it can now have a real conversation with you, and even make your day a bit smoother by predicting information you might need. Today we added the ability to set reminders by voice and we previewed “spoken answers” on laptops and desktops in Chrome—meaning you can ask Google a question and it will speak the answer back to you.</li>
<li><b><a href=""http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2013/05/meet-new-google-maps-map-for-every.html"">Maps</a>:</b> Today we previewed the next generation of Google Maps, which gets rid of any clutter in order to put your individual experience and exploration front and center. Each time you click or search, our technology draws you a tailored map that highlights the information you need. From design to directions, the new Google Maps is smarter and more useful.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Technology can have a profound, positive impact on the daily lives of billions of people. But we can’t do this alone—developers play a crucial role. I/O is our chance to come together and thank you for everything you do.<br />

7542237418054289396,,Google Blogs,2013-05-09T04:20:00-07:00,A picture of Earth through time,"Today, we're making it possible for you to go back in time and get a stunning historical perspective on the changes to the Earth’s surface over time. Working with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), NASA and TIME, we're releasing more than a quarter-century of images of Earth taken from space, compiled for the first time into an interactive time-lapse experience. We believe this is the most comprehensive picture of our changing planet ever made available to the public. <br />
<br />
Built from millions of satellite images and trillions of pixels, you can explore this global, zoomable time-lapse map as part of TIME's new <a href=""http://www.time.com/timelapse"">Timelapse</a> project. View stunning phenomena such as the sprouting of Dubai’s artificial Palm Islands, the retreat of Alaska’s Columbia Glacier, the deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon and urban growth in Las Vegas from 1984 to 2012:<br />

<i>Feel free to share these GIFs! <a href=""https://plus.google.com/b/106191537604091348855/photos/+GoogleEarth/albums/5875822979804092129"">More examples can be found on Google+</a>.</i></div><br />
The images were collected as part of an ongoing joint mission between the USGS and NASA called <a href=""http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/"">Landsat</a>. Their satellites have been observing earth from space since the 1970s—with all of the images sent back to Earth and archived on USGS tape drives that look something like this <a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lEjeqRDEFmU/UYsrpLYPmYI/AAAAAAAAMRs/NOH7ZofjBNY/s1600/USGS+imagery+tape+vault+in+Sioux+Falls+South+Dakota+-+3c.jpg"">example</a>&nbsp;(courtesy of the USGS).<br />
<br />
We started working with the USGS in 2009 to make this historic archive of earth imagery available online. Using <a href=""http://earthengine.google.org/"">Google Earth Engine</a> technology, we sifted through 2,068,467 images—a total of 909 terabytes of data—to find the highest-quality pixels (e.g., those without clouds), for every year since 1984 and for every spot on Earth. We then compiled these into enormous planetary images, 1.78 terapixels each, one for each year. <br />
<br />
As the final step, we worked with the CREATE Lab at Carnegie Mellon University, recipients of a <a href=""http://research.google.com/university/relations/focused_research_awards.html"">Google Focused Research Award</a>, to convert these annual Earth images into a seamless, browsable HTML5 animation. Check it out on Google’s <a href=""http://earthengine.google.org/timelapse"">Timelapse</a> website.<br />
<br />
Much like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble"">iconic image of Earth from the Apollo 17 mission</a>—which had a profound effect on many of us—this time-lapse map is not only fascinating to explore, but we also hope it can inform the global community’s thinking about how we live on our planet and the policies that will guide us in the future. A special thanks to all our partners who helped us to make this happen. <br />

But in fact, millions of people around the world speak an incredible array of languages that currently have a small presence across the web. <br />
<br />
<a href=""https://translate.google.com/"">Google Translate</a> helps bridge the divide between the content available online and people’s ability to access that information. Starting today, you can translate another five languages using Google, which combined are spoken by more than 183 million people around the globe:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Bosnian</b> is an official language in Bosnia and Herzegovina that’s also spoken in regions of neighboring countries and by diaspora communities around the world.</li>
<li><b>Cebuano</b> is one of the languages spoken in the Philippines, predominantly in the middle (Visayas) and southern (Mindanao) regions of the nation.</li>
<li>You can hear the <b>Hmong</b> language spoken in many countries across the world, including China, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and throughout the United States.</li>
<li><b>Javanese</b> is the second most-spoken language in Indonesia (behind Indonesian), with 83 million native speakers.</li>
<li><b>Marathi</b> is spoken in India and has 73 million native speakers. Google Translate already supports several other Indian languages: Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu.</li>
</ul>
<br />
With the exception of Bosnian, these new languages are “alpha,” meaning while the quality isn’t perfect, we will continue to test and improve them over time.<br />

EDSAC is noteworthy for marking the transition from “<a href=""http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/birth-of-the-computer/4/95"" target=""_blank"">test to tool</a>” in civilian computing. &nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11875821"" target=""_blank"">Maurice Wilkes</a>, EDSAC’s designer, sought to build a multi-purpose, reliable workhorse that would bring unrivalled calculating power to University of Cambridge researchers. &nbsp;His aim wasn’t to be at the cutting edge of engineering; rather to be at the forefront of delivering a computer-powered general calculation service. &nbsp;Above all else, Wilkes wanted EDSAC to be a <a href=""http://www.tnmoc.org/special-projects/edsac/edsac-history"" target=""_blank"">practical computer</a>, useful and accessible to a wide range of researchers. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<br />
In May 1949 EDSAC became the world’s first general purpose stored program computer to enter regular service, transforming scientific research at the University of Cambridge by making it possible to speedily tackle analyses of previously impractical scale, across disciplines as varied as astronomy, economics, biology and more. <br />
<br />
But EDSAC’s legacy stretches far further. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine"" target=""_blank"">Subroutines</a>—a central tenet of programming today—were invented by <a href=""http://www.computer.org/portal/web/awards/cp-wheeler"" target=""_blank"">David Wheeler</a> to make it easier to program EDSAC by re-using lines of existing code. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Diploma_in_Computer_Science"" target=""_blank"">world’s first computer science diploma</a> had EDSAC as its foundation. The <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/inside-leo-the-first-business-computer-3040094438/"" target=""_blank"">world’s first business computer</a> was built with EDSAC as a prototype. <br />
<br />
Sadly, little remains physically of EDSAC today. That’s why a team of U.K. volunteers have embarked on <a href=""http://www.tnmoc.org/special-projects/edsac"" target=""_blank"">an ambitious project</a> to construct a working replica of the original EDSAC, in partnership with <a href=""http://www.tnmoc.org/"" target=""_blank"">The National Museum of Computing</a>. We’re <a href=""http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/rebuilding-illustrious-ancestor-to.html"" target=""_blank"">delighted to support</a> the EDSAC Rebuild Project, and we look forward to welcoming it back to regular service—as a reminder of the U.K.’s illustrious computing past. <br />

While there, we were reminded of a classic mathematical problem: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg"">the Seven Bridges of Koenigsberg</a>.<br />
<br />
The mathematical problem posed an interesting challenge: find a route through Kaliningrad—which was once separated by the Pregel River—by crossing each of the seven bridges in town. The catch? One could only cross each bridge exactly once. <br />
<br />

<br />
In 1735, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler"">Leonhard Euler</a>, one of the most prolific mathematicians of all time and <a href=""http://www.google.com/doodles/leonhard-eulers-306th-birthday"">our recent Doodle subject</a>, concluded that there was no solution to the problem because it was impossible to find a route that would cross each bridge only once. This famous problem and Leonhard Euler’s non-resolution paved the way for important discoveries in the field of mathematics including <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory"">graph theory</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology"">topology</a>. <br />
<br />
Fast forward 278 years to today where we still rely on Euler’s findings to calculate optimal driving routes for our Street View cars. We use sophisticated algorithms, based on graph theory, to determine the best route through a city or town—helping us capture all the images we need in the shortest amount of time. Though these algorithms are complex, in simple terms, it's equivalent to solving the problem of drawing a house without lifting your pen and never going over the same segment twice. Like this: <br />

9033747349932083623,,Google Blogs,2013-04-29T09:00:00-07:00,"Matt Harding: Around the world, one dance at a time with Google Maps ","Today is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Dance_Day"">International Dance Day</a>, a celebration of a universal art form that spans cultures and countries. But dancing isn’t just limited to holidays. Since 2003, <a href=""http://www.wherethehellismatt.com/about"">Matt Harding</a> has famously been dancing his way across the globe with people from all walks of life and sharing to millions on his <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/mattharding2718?feature=watch"">YouTube channel</a>. His mission is simple: Dance. Dance with everyone. Dance everywhere. Dance to spread joy.<br />
<br />
Matt’s journey began with a serendipitous, <a href=""http://www.wherethehellismatt.com/maps/2003-travel"">single dance step</a> in Hanoi. While traveling through Southeast Asia, his friend encouraged him to dance for the camera—and he just kept dancing. At first, he was amused by the idea of capturing himself dancing in front of famous landmarks and in famous cities around the world. Since then, Matt’s videos have evolved beyond a single man dancing; his videos now focus on individuals that gather together to share in the fun of dance, as you can see in his <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwe-pA6TaZk"">2012 YouTube film</a>.<br />
<br />
The joy that goes into Matt’s work is apparent—and well documented. However, there’s also a fair amount of planning involved to choreograph his efforts. Matt relies on <a href=""http://maps.google.com/helloworld"">Google Maps</a> for comprehensive, accurate and useful tools to execute and track his steps. <br />
<br />
<div style=""text-align: center;""><iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/VI52ZgaPe_E?rel=0"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
</div><br />
Before he sets off on each adventure, Matt uses Google Maps to scout various locations. Using <a href=""http://maps.google.com/streetview"">Street View</a> and photos in Google Maps, he finds landmarks and points of interest around the globe that are prefect dance spots. For instance, he came across Piazza del Popolo while exploring Rome with Street View. These tools come in handy to help Matt choose a backdrop to highlight his assembly of exuberant, local dancers. <br />
<br />
<div style=""text-align: center;""><iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""350"" marginheight=""0"" marginwidth=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://maps.google.com/maps?daddr=Piazza+del+Popolo,+00187+Rome,+Italy&amp;gl=us&amp;panel=1&amp;fb=1&amp;dirflg=d&amp;geocode=0,41.910685,12.476305&amp;cid=0,0,652705663488327139&amp;hq=Piazza+del+Popolo&amp;t=m&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=41.910384,12.476908&amp;panoid=dysttSfjPEK03Y43TDQAiA&amp;cbp=12,312.82,,1,-10&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=41.909719,12.477593&amp;spn=0.010843,0.022724&amp;source=embed&amp;output=svembed"" width=""425""></iframe><br />

Scouting is only part of the process. Once Matt has coordinated a group in a city, he helps  everyone get to the designated destination by creating a customized <a href=""http://support.google.com/maps/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=62843"">My Map</a> and sharing it with the participants so they can easily navigate to the planned meetup location. The end result is something everyone around the world can relate to.<br />

We use them for all sorts of things, like getting reminders of important calendar appointments (say, a first date), and driving directions to the Italian restaurant where your table for two awaits. Today, with the launch of Google Now on iPhone and iPad, your smartphone will become even smarter.  <br />
<br />
Google Now is about giving you just the right information at just the right time. It can show you the day’s weather as you get dressed in the morning, or alert you that there’s heavy traffic between you and your butterfly-inducing date—so you’d better leave now! It can also share news updates on a story you’ve been following, remind you to leave for the airport so you can make your flight and <a href=""http://google.com/now"">much more</a>. There’s no digging required: cards appear at the moment you need them most—and the more you use Google Now, the more you get out of it.<br />

In addition to the handy cards in Google Now, the Google Search app still gives you instant answers to all your questions. Try tapping the microphone and speak to your phone—you’ll get quick answers spoken back to you. For example, ask Google, “Do I need an umbrella this weekend?” and you’ll get the forecast.  Or ask “Who’s in the cast of ‘Oblivion’?” to decide if you want to see it. Voice Search is particularly handy on the go—try ""Show me nearby pizza places"" and you'll see a map of restaurants around you with directions, phone numbers, ratings and hours.<br />

<br />
Can free speech survive in the digital age? At a time when too many governments deny their citizens the right to dissent, we’ll ask if the Internet is reaching its promise of empowering people around the world. We’ll have sessions on the limits to free speech online, national security in the Internet age, and creativity and freedom on the web. <br />

In this particular time period, we received court orders in several countries to remove blog posts criticizing government officials or their associates. <br />
<br />
You can read more about these requests by looking at the <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/notes/?by=period"">annotations</a> section of the Transparency Report. Of particular note were three occurrences that took place in the second half of 2012:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>There was a sharp increase in requests from <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/BR/"">Brazil</a>, where we received 697 requests to remove content from our platforms (of which 640 were court orders—meaning we received an average of 3.5 court orders per day during this time period), up from 191 during the first half of the year. The big reason for the spike was the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_municipal_elections,_2012"">municipal elections</a>, which took place last fall. Nearly half of the total requests—316 to be exact—called for the removal of 756 pieces of content related to alleged violations of the <a href=""http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/l4737.htm"">Brazilian Electoral Code</a>, which forbids defamation and commentary that offends candidates. We’re appealing many of these cases, on the basis that the content is protected by freedom of expression under the Brazilian Constitution.<br />
</li>
<li>Another place where we saw an increase was from <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/RU/"">Russia</a>, where a <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20096274"">new law took effect</a> last fall. In the first half of 2012, we received six requests, the most we had ever received in any given six-month period from Russia. But in the second half of the year, we received 114 requests to remove content—107 of them citing this new law.<br />
</li>
<li>During this period, we received inquiries from 20 countries regarding YouTube videos containing clips of the movie “Innocence of Muslims.” While the videos were within our <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines"">Community Guidelines</a>, we restricted videos from view in several countries in accordance with local law after receiving formal legal complaints. We also temporarily restricted videos from view in Egypt and Libya due to the particularly difficult circumstances there.</li>
</ul><br />
We’ve also made a couple of improvements to the Transparency Report since our last update:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>We’re now breaking down government requests about YouTube videos to clarify whether we removed videos in response to government requests for violating Community Guidelines, or whether we restricted videos from view due to local laws. You can see the details by scrolling to the bottom of each country-specific page.<br />
</li>
<li>We’ve also refreshed the look of the <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic"">Traffic</a> section, making it easier to see where and when disruptions have occurred to Google services. You can see a map where our services are currently disrupted; you can see a map of all known disruptions since 2009; and you can more easily navigate between time periods and regions.</li>
</ul><br />
The information we share on the Transparency Report is just a sliver of what happens on the Internet. But as we disclose more data and continue to expand it over time, we hope it helps draw attention to the laws around the world that govern the free flow of information online. <br />

We launched Street View <a href=""http://google-latlong.blogspot.co.uk/2007/05/introducing-street-view.html"">in 2007 in five U.S. cities</a> to give you what we called a “feet on the ground” experience and have since been growing the program to make it more comprehensive, accurate and useful for everyone. <br />
<br />
Today, we’ve reached 50 countries with the launch of Street View in Hungary and Lesotho and are significantly expanding our coverage in Poland and Romania, among other locations around the world. This is also the <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgoogle-latlong.blogspot.com%2F2012%2F10%2Fmaking-google-maps-more-comprehensive.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH4Xg2-KBgZazJ1xbdaLXjpAutE_g"">largest single update</a> of Street View imagery we’ve ever pushed, including new and updated imagery for nearly 350,000 miles of roads across 14 countries.<br />

<br />
Over the past eight years more than 6,000 students have “graduated” from this global program, working with almost 400 different open source projects. Students who are accepted into the program will put the skills they have learned in university to good use by working on an actual software project over the summer. Students are paired with mentors to help address technical questions and concerns throughout the course of the project. With the knowledge and hands-on experience students gain during the summer they strengthen their future employment opportunities in fields related to their academic pursuits. Best of all, more source code is created and released for the use and benefit of all.<br />
<br />
Interested students can submit proposals on the <a href=""http://google-melange.com/"">website</a> starting now through Friday, May 3 at 12:00pm PDT. Get started by reviewing the ideas pages of the <a href=""http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2013"">177 open source projects</a> in this year’s program, and decide which projects you’re interested in. Because Google Summer of Code has a limited number of spots for students, writing a great project proposal is essential to being selected to the program—be sure to check out the <a href=""http://www.booki.cc/gsocstudentguide/"">Student Manual</a> for advice.<br />
<br />
For ongoing information throughout the application period and beyond, see the <a href=""http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/"">Google Open Source blog</a>, join our Summer of Code <a href=""http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page#1._What_are_the_program_mailing_lists"">mailing lists</a> or join us on Internet relay chat at #gsoc on <a href=""http://freenode.net/"">Freenode</a>.<br />

5363797742662391913,,Google Blogs,2013-04-22T11:00:00-07:00,In support of a national STEM Teacher Corps,"Last year, while hosting the White House Science Fair, <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/06/president-obama-host-white-house-science-fair-0"">President Obama said</a>, “If you win the NCAA championship, you come to the White House. Well, if you're a young person and you produce the best experiment or design, the best hardware or software, you ought to be recognized for that achievement, too.” We agree—and we think the best science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) teachers who inspire those young people should be honored and supported as well.<br />
<br />
That’s why Google and our partner organizations support a national STEM Teacher Corps to acknowledge the great teachers who help students achieve amazing things in the fields of science and technology. We’re excited that the President has recommended funding for a STEM Teacher Corps in <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2014_R&amp;Dbudget_STEM.pdf"">his budget</a>&nbsp;(PDF).<br />
<br />
Today we’re co-publishing a <a href=""http://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/google_stemteachers_apr2013.pdf"">white paper</a>&nbsp;(PDF) with <a href=""http://www.mathforamerica.org/"">Math For America</a> and the <a href=""http://www.broadinstitute.org/"">Broad Institute</a> that outlines some of the key features of such a corps.  We gathered input from more than 80 organizations to make  recommendations for a program that will reward teachers and schools with significant stipends, foster a community of teachers empowered to make broad improvements in STEM education, and recognize a larger percentage of teachers than any existing recognition program.<br />
<br />
We must do more to retain the best teachers so our students have  the opportunity to succeed in these growing fields, and we applaud the many organizations already working to elevate and celebrate the top STEM teachers nationwide.   We look forward to continuing to support the development of the STEM Teacher Corps and doing our part to ensure that every student has access to truly great STEM teachers.<br />

As another way to move from awareness to action, we’re hosting a Google+ Hangout On Air <a href=""https://plus.google.com/events/cbeu0bbeu4chmpbmkbcao8d32po"">series</a> focused on pressing environmental issues.  We’ll kick it off today at 12pm ET with a Hangout on Air connecting NASA (live from Greenland), National Geographic explorers from around the world, and Underwater Earth (live from the Great Barrier reef).  Throughout the week, we’ll hold daily Hangouts on Air covering topics such as clean water and animal conservation.  <br />
<br />
This Earth Day and every day, let’s take a moment to marvel at the wonder of nature and do our part to protect the natural ecosystem we all depend on.  A salute to <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/products/engineers/"">nature’s engineers</a>!   <br />

2522979210700572891,,Google Blogs,2013-04-22T00:00:00-07:00,Happy birthday Campus London. You’ve grown up so fast.,"Just over 12 months ago, <a href=""http://www.campuslondon.com/"">Campus London</a> opened its doors to the young, upcoming London tech startup community. I’d like to think we always knew it would succeed, but I don’t think any of us expected the level of engagement and enthusiasm we’ve seen in year one.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XJdjVW2v9yo/UXS_U0K2QZI/AAAAAAAAMIU/aSgcuqXyuYs/s1600/1EpmTYq92lnu2AL2qLfrTpWLvhLRaM6IltWPjVA.jpeg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XJdjVW2v9yo/UXS_U0K2QZI/AAAAAAAAMIU/aSgcuqXyuYs/s1600/1EpmTYq92lnu2AL2qLfrTpWLvhLRaM6IltWPjVA.jpeg"" /></a></div>
<br />
In just 365 days of operation, Campus now has more than 10,000 members, permanently houses more than 100 young companies and has hosted more than 850 events, attracting more than 60,000 guests through the door. From individual entrepreneurs looking to explore their back-of-a-napkin idea to global venture fund managers, there’s something for everyone in the London tech scene at Campus, and the vibe is electric.  <br />
<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/3diA0zLlMh8"" width=""640""></iframe><br />
<br />
We asked Campus members to provide their feedback and outlook on year one, and their <a href=""http://www.campuslondon.com/survey"">response</a> has been overwhelmingly positive. Campus-based companies are growing and creating jobs. One in four are already looking to find bigger office spaces to house their growing teams. We’ve also seen that the success of the London technology startup community as a whole has mirrored that of Campus.<br />
<br />
Campus members are younger than the average Tech City entrepreneur, and with initiatives like Women@Campus, increasingly more female entrepreneurs are signing up. Campus is also truly international, with 22 nationalities working, interacting and attending the many mentoring sessions and classes we and our Google volunteers run every day.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">

<br />
Looking ahead to the next year and beyond, we’re offering even more: more globally-acclaimed speakers, a new Campus EDU education programme offering mentorship from Googlers, inspirational talks from thought leaders like Guy Kawasaki, Eric Schmidt and Jimmy Wales, and a curriculum of classes to develop the skills young startups need to build successful businesses.<br />
<br />
Google started as a two-person startup in a garage in California. We’re looking to provide the best possible garage to our 10,000 members every day. And so far, all indicators show that Campus is one of the most exciting places in the world for technological innovation.<br />

To date we’ve committed more than $1 billion to renewable energy project <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/energy/investments/"">investments</a>, signed agreements to <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/energy/use/#purchasing"">procure wind power</a> near our data centers, and <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/energy/#power"">installed solar panels</a> at our corporate headquarters. <br />
<br />
It’s also important to work directly with our utility partners to find solutions that will make more renewable energy available for us and for others. The most straightforward way to do this is for utilities to offer a renewable power option for companies that request it—something that’s not currently offered by most utilities. We’ve just published a <a href=""http://www.google.com/green/pdf/renewable-energy-options.pdf"">white paper</a>&nbsp;(PDF) laying out our thoughts on how and why such programs might work.<br />
<br />
We’re also announcing our first effort to put this idea into practice. We’re expanding our <a href=""http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/lenoir/"">Lenoir, N.C.</a>&nbsp;data center, and our local electricity provider, Duke Energy, has pledged to develop a new program for large companies like Google who want to buy renewable power for their operations. Duke will file the plan with their state commission within 90 days.<br />
<br />
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Fm5BfMRDIvc/UXFWfrcStUI/AAAAAAAAMIA/5vtcXVHHXgc/s1600/1GWSBot_bW5SRiZQhMJNh8VN4u5oBzcRWg298-w.jpeg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""425"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Fm5BfMRDIvc/UXFWfrcStUI/AAAAAAAAMIA/5vtcXVHHXgc/s640/1GWSBot_bW5SRiZQhMJNh8VN4u5oBzcRWg298-w.jpeg"" width=""640"" /></a></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>Our Lenoir, N.C. data center</i></div>
<br />
Offering companies like Google a renewable energy option has many advantages. Because the service is made available to a wide range of customers, companies that don’t have the ability or resources to pursue alternative approaches can participate. And by tapping utilities’ strengths in power generation and delivery, it makes it easier for companies to buy renewable energy on a larger scale. Of course, the approach is not without its challenges: utilities will need to work out the mechanics of the service within their local regulatory structure, and in many cases state utility commissions will need to approve the programs. There’s also the challenge of finding cost-effective renewable projects. <br />
<br />
We'll continue to find creative ways to supply our facilities with renewable energy, but we think this solution can provide an important new way to increase the use of renewable energy nationwide. We look forward to working with utilities, state utility commissions, companies and other stakeholders to make it a reality.  <br />

7584411280001493758,,Google Blogs,2013-04-18T09:08:00-07:00,Bringing Google+ Comments to Blogger,"Reading and responding to comments can be one of the most rewarding aspects of blogging. Not only do they help you connect with your readers, they can also inspire later blog entries. The challenge, oftentimes, is following all the conversations around your content—on Google+, for instance, as well as on your website. So we're making things a lot simpler.<br />
<br />
Starting today, you can bring Google+ Comments to your Blogger blog. Once you've enabled the feature through your Blogger Dashboard, you'll enjoy a number of important benefits:<br />
<br />
<b>View your blog and Google+ comments, all in one place</b><br />
Now when you're browsing your blog's comment threads, you'll see activity from direct visitors, and from people talking about your content on Google+. For example, if there's a public Google+ discussion about one of your blog entries, those comments and replies will also appear on your Blogger blog. This way you can engage with more of your readers, all in one place.<br />
<br />
<b>Help readers comment and connect with their circles</b><br />
Your blog readers will now have the option to comment publicly, or privately to their circles on Google+. And when they're browsing blog comments, they can view all of them, just the top ones, or only those from the people in their circles.<br />
<br />
In all cases, you and your readers will only see the comments you have permission to see. Giving people these kinds of controls not only encourages more meaningful sharing—it can lead to more blog traffic.<br />
<br />
<div style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7zw1_OFSHdg/UW_2dwkgKOI/AAAAAAAAMGw/WAsyR7TjSxc/s1600/Fountain-screenshot-EN.png"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""5"" height=""640"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7zw1_OFSHdg/UW_2dwkgKOI/AAAAAAAAMGw/WAsyR7TjSxc/s640/Fountain-screenshot-EN.png"" width=""561"" /></a></div><br />
To get started with Google+ Comments, just visit the Google+ tab of your Blogger Dashboard, and check “Use Google+ Comments.” (Older comments will continue to appear in the new widget.) You can also visit any post on the Official Google Blog (like <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/04/google-fiberon-silicon-prairie-silicon.html"">this one</a>), or on Blogger Buzz (like<a href=""http://buzz.blogger.com/2013/04/improvements-to-blogger-template-html.html""> this one</a>), to see Google+ Comments in action.<br />
<br />
Happy commenting!<br />

453844926170460106,,Google Blogs,2013-04-17T12:39:00-07:00,"Google Fiber—on the Silicon Prairie, the Silicon Hills and now the Silicon Slopes","Today the <a href=""http://google.com/fiber"">Google Fiber</a> team is in Provo, Utah, where Mayor John Curtis just announced that we intend to make Provo our third Google Fiber City.<br />
<br />
Utah is already home to <a href=""http://www.siliconslopes.com/company/search-companies"">hundreds of tech companies and startups</a>, and many of them are based in Provo.  In fact, the Provo area <a href=""http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/money/55750083-79/patents-growth-granted-unemployment.html.csp"">ranks second in the nation</a> in patent growth, and is consistently ranked as <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2012/06/27/the-best-places-for-business/"">one of the top places to live and do business</a> in the U.S. We believe the future of the Internet will be built on gigabit speeds, and we’re sure the businesses and residents of Provo already have some good ideas for what they’d build with a gig. <br />
<br />
In order to bring Fiber to Provo, we’ve signed an agreement to purchase iProvo, an existing fiber-optic network owned by the city. As a part of the acquisition, we would commit to upgrade the network to gigabit technology and finish network construction so that every home along the existing iProvo network would have the opportunity to connect to Google Fiber. Our agreement with Provo isn’t approved yet—it’s pending a vote by the City Council scheduled for next Tuesday, April 23. We intend to begin the network upgrades as soon as the closing conditions are satisfied and the deal is closed. <br />
<br />
Provo started building their own municipal network in 2004 because they decided that providing access to high speed connectivity was important to their community’s future. In 2011, they <a href=""http://provomayor.blogspot.com/2011/07/whats-latest-on-iprovo.html"">started looking for a partner</a> that could acquire their network and deliver an affordable service for Provoans. We’re committed to keeping their vision alive, and, if the deal is approved and the acquisition closes, we’d offer our <a href=""https://fiber.google.com/about/"">Free Internet service</a> (5 Mbps speeds) to every home along the existing Provo network, for a $30 activation fee and no monthly charge for at least seven years. We would also offer Google Fiber Gigabit Internet—up to 100x faster Internet than today’s average broadband speeds—and the option for Google Fiber TV service with hundreds of your favorite channels. We’d also provide free Gigabit Internet service to 25 local public institutions like schools, hospitals and libraries. <br />
<br />
Over the next few days, we’ll be in and around Provo with Mayor Curtis, attending community meetings and talking to residents about what widespread gigabit connectivity could mean for their community, and the ways in which we’d invest in their iProvo network. If you are a Provoan, we <a href=""http://provomayor.blogspot.com/"">hope to see you there</a>!<br />

In honour of this and all our partners, large and small, traditional and modern, let’s take a quick look at how people are interacting with art online.  <br />
<br />
The Internet brings paintings to life and it seems that <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/moma-the-museum-of-modern-art/artwork/the-starry-night-vincent-van-gogh/320268/"">The Starry Night</a> by van Gogh is the one that visitors to Art Project admire the most. In the past six months, this was the most viewed painting in&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/artworks/?filter.primary_asset_is_gigapixel=True"">gigapixel</a>—an extremely high resolution painting which allows viewers to zoom in to brushstroke level. While nothing beats seeing a painting in real life, the ability to examine a work of art in this level of detail seems to be encouraging viewers to linger. One minute is the average time spent looking at any given painting on the Art Project website, compared to under 20 seconds (according to several studies) in a museum. <br />
<br />
The Starry Night is also the most frequently included painting in <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/galleries/"">user galleries</a>, where individuals create and share their own virtual art collections. We have 40,000 works of art on the platform but some remain perennial favourites. The other most popular inclusions in user galleries (in order) are :<br />

<br />
Viewings of user galleries were in fact higher than any individual artist or painting. To date, 360,000 galleries have been created, 14,000 of which are public on the web. To mark World Art Day, we asked some of our <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/collections/"">partners</a> to curate user galleries of their own. Take a look through the selections of eight museum directors <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/galleries/"">here</a>.<br />
<br />
Given the list above, it’s clear the classics remain popular with viewers, but there is increasing interest in modern art as well, with <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/artist/salvador-dal%C3%AD/4132134/"">Dali</a> and <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/artist/gustav-klimt/4127340/"">Klimt</a> featuring among the most searched for artists. The Internet has also allowed users to explore multiple genres in a single destination. More than 30 different mediums co-exist on Art Project with oil on canvas next to over 5,000 objects including <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/collection/the-museum-of-islamic-art-qatar/artwork/silk-velvet-textile-unknown-iran-17th-century/808548/"">silk textiles</a>, <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/galleries/24058347/24046349/"">sculptures</a> and <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/galleries/24156475/24196192/"">furniture</a>. There can't be many places where you can find <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/collection/sao-paulo-street-art/"">Brazilian street art</a> alongside <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/artist/sandro-botticelli/4128053/"">Botticelli</a>.<br />
<br />
Many partners who have contributed an art collection have also opted to put their museums on Street View. On average, visitors spend around two minutes exploring the interior of the buildings and viewing the paintings on display. The most-visited Street View destination on Art Project is <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/collection/the-white-house/museumview/"">The White House</a>. As the majority of us will never get the opportunity to go inside, the Internet allows a rare glimpse into a global institution that also houses an extensive art <a href=""http://www.googleartproject.com/en-gb/collection/the-white-house/"">collection</a>.<br />
<br />
With over 200 partners from 43 countries, we continue our quest to open up access to art to millions of professionals, students, beginners and amateur enthusiasts. At 1pm ET today, we’ll be holding the latest in our <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.nl/2013/03/introducing-art-talks-on-google.html"">Art Talks</a> series on our <a href=""https://google.com/+GoogleArtProject/posts"">G+ page</a>, which aims to put art lovers in touch with art experts online.

For many students, the web has become an incredible resource for the classroom, offering tools to work collaboratively, share and research. School systems of all sizes—from a single primary school to an entire country such as the <a href=""http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2012/09/islands-in-cloud-philippines-department.html"">Philippines</a>—have “Gone Google” in their schools and embraced the web to transform education.<br />
<br />
Today the country of Malaysia is going a step further by adopting <a href=""http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/education/"">Google Apps</a> for 10 million students, teachers and parents. As part of this initiative they are also deploying Chromebooks to primary and secondary schools nationwide. These efforts to integrate the web are a central part of a <a href=""http://www.moe.gov.my/userfiles/file/PPP/Preliminary-Blueprint-Eng.pdf"">national plan</a> (PDF) to reform its educational system.<br />

<br />
To deploy technology across a nationwide school system, computers need to be simple, manageable and secure. Chromebooks are ideal for learning and sharing in the classroom—there’s nothing complicated to learn, they boot up in seconds and have virus protection built in. They also offer <a href=""http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2012/05/next-step-in-chrome-os-journey-for.html"">easy setup and deployment</a>, which means they’re ready to go the moment a student opens the lid and logs in. And with reduced overhead costs, Chromebooks are a cost-efficient option* to deploy technology at scale.<br />
<br />
To date, more than 3,000 schools worldwide, from Edina, Minnesota to Point England, New Zealand, have deployed Chromebooks to <a href=""http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/education/devices/casestudies.html#casestudy-councilbluffs"">improve attendance and graduation rates</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/education/devices/casestudies.html#casestudy-fonddulac"">make learning more fun</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/education/devices/casestudies.html#casestudy-hartford"">enable students to take more ownership for their learning</a>.<br />
<br />
The web gives our children and students new opportunities to access the world’s information and work collaboratively. We look forward to working with <a href=""http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/education/devices/large-deployments.html"">national and regional leaders</a> to make the most of the web with Google Apps and Chromebooks and help them provide the best opportunities to every student.<br />

Out of all of these, human trafficking is perhaps the most devastating, enslaving nearly 21 million people and <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ilo.org%2Fwcmsp5%2Fgroups%2Fpublic%2F%40ed_norm%2F%40declaration%2Fdocuments%2Fpublication%2Fwcms_081882.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFTPE_7veJMKwnsypzvr6O9txf5lA"">generating</a> at least $32 billion of illicit profits every year. At last summer's <a href=""http://www.google.com/ideas"">Google Ideas</a> <a href=""http://youtube.com/info2012"">summit on mapping, disrupting and exposing illicit networks</a>, it became clear that connecting anti-trafficking helplines in a global data sharing collaboration could help identify illicit patterns and provide victims anywhere in the world with more effective support. Today, <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polarisproject.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2BZrmv117XiUr2GF7ZgfWK4Fkbw"">Polaris Project</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Flibertyasia.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFndZSsEwEz4J6RW2AbF1Jm36afJg"">Liberty Asia</a>, and <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Flastradainternational.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHV0dkyerPEqZAVRz2Xl5lOhYC3aQ"">La Strada International</a> are receiving a $3 million <a href=""http://www.google.com/giving/impact-awards.html"">Global Impact Award</a> from Google to do just that. Building on our <a href=""http://www.google.com/landing/givesback/2011/"">2011 grants</a>, this brings our total commitment to anti-trafficking efforts to $14.5 million.<br />
<br />
Global Impact Awards support nonprofits that use technology to launch disruptive solutions in their sector. We <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgoogleblog.blogspot.com%2F2012%2F12%2Fnew-global-impact-awards-program.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGmErIyLWuT9yxOuyWi0NR_KQ8zQw"">launched</a> the Global Impact Awards program last December to fund new ideas with a potential for huge scale. And at the <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgoogleblog.blogspot.com%2F2012%2F07%2Fgoogle-ideas-joining-fight-against-drug.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFjVH7nkoZkI_rmiB4BDmnBixYipw"">Google Ideas INFO summit</a> over the summer, we brought together technologists, leaders, and those with unique personal experiences — including former weapons brokers and survivors of domestic and international human trafficking — to look at illicit networks and their defining obstacles. By connecting technologists and experts with those who understand and have lived through trafficking situations, our discussion centered around a fundamental question: What if local, national, and regional anti-trafficking helplines across the globe were all connected in a data-driven network that helped disrupt the web of human trafficking?<br />
<br />

<br />
Since the summit, we’ve worked with Polaris Project, Liberty Asia and La Strada International to make this concept a reality. These organizations exist to provide vital help to victims in need across the United States, the Mekong Delta region and Europe. Now, working across borders, this new Global Human Trafficking Hotline Network will collect data from local hotline efforts, share promising practices and create anti-trafficking strategies that build on common patterns and focus on eradication, prevention and victim protection. To enhance the participating organizations' ability to better share, analyze and act upon their data in real time, <a href=""http://www.palantir.com/2013/04/collaborating-with-googles-global-impact-award-winners-to-fight-human-trafficking/"">Palantir Technologies</a> will expand on its existing relationship with Polaris Project by donating its data integration and analytics platform for this project. In addition, <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.salesforce.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAMJGO7L2drck6VpHN4y3uYNmnLQ"">Salesforce.com</a> supports Polaris Project's hotline center and is helping scale their call tracking infrastructure internationally.<br />
<br />
Together, these partners will not only be able to help more trafficking survivors, but will also move the global conversation forward by dramatically increasing the amount of useful data being shared. Appropriate data can tell the anti-trafficking community which campaigns are most effective at reducing slavery, what sectors are undergoing global spikes in slavery, or if the reduction of slavery in one country coincides with an increase right across the border.<br />
<br />
In the U.S., Polaris Project has collected data from over 72,000 hotline calls, helping local and national anti-trafficking communities better understand the dynamics of the crime. No such actionable hotline database has existed globally — but it doesn’t need to be that way. Clear international strategies, increased cooperation, and appropriate data sharing amongst anti-trafficking organizations will help victims, prevention efforts, and sound policymaking. Slavery can be stopped. Let's get to it.<br />

Two years ago, we announced that we’d be bringing Google Fiber to Kansas City to show what’s possible with super fast Internet access, and since November we’ve been connecting homes there to gigabit Internet that’s 100 times faster than today’s average broadband performance.<br />
<br />
Today, we’re pleased to announce with Mayor Lee Leffingwell that Austin, Texas is becoming a Google Fiber city. It’s a mecca for creativity and entrepreneurialism, with thriving artistic and tech communities, as well as the University of Texas and its new medical research hospital. We’re sure these folks will do amazing things with gigabit access, and we feel very privileged to have been welcomed to their community.<br />
<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/lALafkdBLTA"" width=""560""></iframe><br />
<br />
Our goal is to start connecting homes in Austin by mid-2014. Customers there will have a similar <a href=""https://fiber.google.com/about/"">choice of products</a> as our customers in Kansas City: Gigabit Internet or Gigabit Internet plus our Google Fiber TV service with nearly 200 HD TV channels. We’re still working out pricing details, but we expect them to be roughly similar to Kansas City. Also, as in Kansas City, we’re going to offer customers a free Internet connection at 5 mbps for 7 years, provided they pay a one-time construction fee. We’re also planning to connect many public institutions as we build in Austin— schools, hospitals, community centers, etc. — at a gigabit for no charge. If you live in Austin and want to sign up for more information, please visit our website.<br />
<br />
The Internet is still in its early days and has so much more potential to improve our lives. The web helps students and families access essential resources, from information about jobs and healthcare to banking and educational services. Communities that are connected to the Internet grow stronger because there’s greater potential to create jobs, drive economic growth, and help businesses succeed. We believe the Internet’s next chapter will be built on gigabit speeds, and we hope this new Google Fiber city will inspire communities across America to think about what ultrafast connectivity could mean for them. If you’re a city leader and you’re looking for some help making your city gigabit-friendly, have a look at <a href=""http://www.fcc.gov/events/gigabit-workshop-1"">this video</a> from the FCC’s March 2013 Workshop on Gigabit Community Broadband Networks for steps you can take towards your own gigabit-powered future.<br />

“[Public speaking] is quite simple, say what you have to say and</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
when you come to a sentence with a grammatical ending, sit down.” —Winston Churchill</div>
<br />
If only public speaking were actually that easy. We’re often asked to present in front of a group, so good presentation skills are really important. Fear of public speaking is often <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2012/10/09/five-reasons-why-the-fear-of-public-speaking-is-great-for-you/"">ranked</a> higher than fear of spiders, flying and heights. While spiders can make me jumpy, I not only <i>enjoy</i> public speaking, I also teach it. <br />
<br />
In addition to my core role as Google Toronto’s agency team lead (helping to nurture relationships with some of the largest ad agencies in Canada), I help my colleagues amp up their public speaking skills as a g2g (Googler-to-Googler) facilitator for two classes, “Presenting with Confidence” and “Presenting with Charisma.” These two classes help my fellow Googlers erase anxiety and self-doubt and focus on the goal—communicating your message. I am actually a mechanical engineer by trade who, at one point, entered graduate school to study robotics. Not exactly the type that comes to mind when you think of great orators. But I’ve learned along the way, as an engineer turned “sales guy,” that a confident demeanor and a little charm can turn a snooze-fest into an engaging, lively meeting.<br />

<br />
“Presenting with Confidence” goes beyond the “picture the audience in their underwear” adage. First, students are tasked with making brief presentations about themselves, whether it be about their most recent vacation or how they play in a jazz band. We videotape the students giving their presentations on their phones to review later as a part of the exercise and to keep for their own reference. This, as it turns out, is one of the most effective, eye-opening exercises in the class. Before we roll the tape, the participant comments on an area he/she believes will be pointed out by others, such as, “I always fidget with my hands” or, “I blush as red as a tomato.” The reality is often completely different, and provides an immediate boost of confidence, allowing the student to focus on the content of their presentation. Part of the confidence boost also stems from being surrounded by peers who are in the same boat, so there’s no judgment. <br />

<br />
“Presenting with Charisma” focuses on adding charm and magnetism to your speech. The more the audience wants to hear from a speaker, the more information they’ll absorb. In this class, Googlers nail down the right mix of tone, body language and delivery to better captivate their audience. We role play to learn how to conquer inevitable yet potentially disastrous moments, like when your technology demo crashes. <br />
<br />
I experienced one such moment myself when I covered a presentation for a fellow Googler at the last minute. When I started getting asked questions that were beyond my ability to handle, I followed the advice I give my own students, which is to remain calm, upbeat and easy-going—no matter what. I decided to play off the audience’s own knowledge so that the Q&amp;A became more of a dialogue rather than the spotlight shining solely on me.<br />
<br />
Solid communication skills anchor any job function. Whether you are an engineer presenting new findings to your manager or a salesperson pitching a new business strategy to a client, a few tips and a lot of practice can make a significant impact on your presentations. If you’re one of the many, <i>many</i> professionals who feels uneasy about getting up in front of a room full of people, try the following tried-and-true techniques to start mastering the art of public speaking.<br />
<br />
<b>Tips and tricks to boost your public speaking confidence and charisma:</b><br />
<br />
<b>1) Pace yourself.</b> To slow down and build momentum, try reciting a sentence then walking to the other side of the room. Pause, then walk back to the other side and deliver your next sentence. <br />
<br />
<b>2) Unfreeze.</b> What to do if you totally freeze during your presentation? Look at your slide or notes and just describe what you see on the slide or page in front of you. The words will start flowing and come back to you.<br />
<br />
<b>3) Fidget and fiddle no more.</b> Displacement tactic: if you find yourself always fiddling with your hands or keeping your hands in your pockets, try standing behind a chair or a podium and planting your hands on the podium so you appear confident. (Even <a href=""http://app1.kuhf.org/_images/jfk_moon/JFK_podium-tn.jpg"">political leaders</a> use this trick.)<br />
<br />
<b>4) Get physical.</b> Use the room to your advantage and keep your audience alert. Walk across the room or even among the audience to get people involved in your presentation. <br />
<br />
<b>5) Stop saying “Um.”</b> To rid yourself of “umm”-ing your way through a presentation, use this physical displacement tactic: Every time you are transitioning from one point to another, do something small but physical, like moving your pen. Making a conscious effort to move the pen will turn your brain off from using a verbal filler instead.<br />
